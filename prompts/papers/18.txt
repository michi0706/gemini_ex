Commuting, Migration, and Local Employment Elasticities†

By Ferdinando Monte, Stephen J. Redding, and Esteban Rossi-Hansberg*

We provide theory and evidence that the elasticity of local employment 
to  a  labor  demand  shock  is  heterogeneous  depending  on  the  com-
muting openness of the local labor market. We develop a quantitative 
general equilibrium model that incorporates spatial linkages in goods 

markets (trade) and factor markets (commuting and migration). We

quantify this model to match the observed gravity equation relation-
ships  for  trade  and  commuting.  We  find  that   empirically-observed 
reductions in commuting costs generate welfare gains of around 3.3 
percent. We provide separate  quasi-experimental evidence in support 
of the model’s predictions using the location decisions of million dol-

lar plants. (JEL J23, J61, R23, R32, R41)

Agents spend about 8 percent of their workday commuting to and from work.1 
They make this significant daily investment, to live and work in different locations, 
so as to balance their living costs and residential amenities with the wage they can 
obtain  at  their  place  of  employment.  The  ability  of  firms  in  a  location  to  attract 
workers depends, therefore, not only on the ability to attract local residents through 
migration, but also on the ability to attract commuters from other, nearby, locations. 
Together, migration and commuting determine the response of local employment to 
a local labor demand shock, which we term the local employment elasticity. This 
elasticity is of great policy interest since it determines the impact of local policies, 
such as transport infrastructure investments, local taxation, and regional develop-
ment programs. Estimating its magnitude has been the subject of a large empiri-
cal literature on local labor markets, which has considered a variety of sources of 
local  labor  demand  shocks,  including  sectoral  composition (Bartik  shocks),  pro-
ductivity, international trade, natural resource abundance, and business cycle fluc-
tuations,  as  discussed  further  below.2  In  this  paper,  we  explore  the  determinants

and  characteristics of the local employment elasticity (and the corresponding local 
resident elasticity).
We begin by developing a quantitative general equilibrium model that incorpo-
rates  spatial  linkages  between  locations  in  both  goods  markets (trade)  and  factor 
markets (commuting and migration). We show that there is no single local employ-
ment elasticity. Instead, the local employment elasticity is an endogenous variable 
that differs across locations depending on their linkages to one another in goods and 
factor markets. Quantifying our model to county-level data for the United States, we 
find that the elasticity of local employment with respect to local productivity shocks 
varies  from  around  0.5  to  2.5.  Therefore,  an  average  local  employment  elasticity 
estimated from cross-section data can be quite misleading when used to predict the 
impact of a local shock or policy on any individual county. We use our quantitative 
model to understand the systematic determinants of the local employment elasticity 
and show that a large part of the variation results from differences in commuting links 
between a location and its neighbors. We then propose variables that can be included 
in reduced-form regressions to improve their ability to account for the heterogeneity 
in local employment responses without imposing the full structure of our model.

Our theoretical framework allows for an arbitrary number of locations that can 
differ in productivity, amenities, and geographical relationship to one another. The 
spatial distribution of economic activity is driven by a tension between productiv-
ity differences and home market effects (forces for the concentration of economic 
activity) and an inelastic supply of land and commuting costs (dispersion forces). 
Commuting allows workers to access high productivity employment locations with-
out having to live there and hence alleviates the congestion effect in such high pro-
ductivity locations. We show that the resulting commuting flows between locations 
exhibit a gravity equation relationship with a much higher distance elasticity than 
for goods flows, suggesting that moving people is more costly than moving goods 
across geographic space. We discipline our quantitative spatial model to match the 
observed gravity equation relationships for trade in goods and commuting flows as 
well as the observed cross-section distributions of employment, residents, and wages 
across US counties. Given the observed data on wages, employment by workplace, 
commuting  flows  and  land  area,  and  a  parameterization  of  trade  and  commuting 
costs, we show that our model can be used to recover unique values of the unob-
served location fundamentals (productivity and amenities) that exactly rationalize 
the observed data as an equilibrium of the model. We show how the values of these 
observed variables in an initial equilibrium can be used to undertake counterfactuals 
for the impact of local labor demand shocks (captured by productivity shocks in our 
model) and for the impact of changes in trade or commuting costs.
An advantage of our explicitly modeling the spatial linkages between locations is 
that our framework can be taken to data on local economic activity at different levels 
of spatial aggregation. In contrast, existing research that does not explicitly model 
these spatial linkages is faced with a trade-off when studying local labor markets. 
On the one hand, larger spatial units have the advantage of reducing the unmodeled 
spatial linkages between locations. On the other hand, larger spatial units reduce the 
ability to make inferences about local labor markets. Existing research has typically 
resolved  this  trade-off  by  defining  commuting  zones (CZs)  that  are  aggregations 
of counties chosen to minimize commuting flows. However, there exists no choice

of boundaries for local labor markets that completely eliminates commuting. For 
example, should Princeton, NJ be considered part of New York’s or Philadelphia’s 
local labor market? Some of its residents commute to New York, but others com-
mute  to  Philadelphia.  Furthermore,  often  researchers  are  interested  in  the  effects 
of policy interventions at spatial scales smaller than CZs. For example, transport 
infrastructure  improvements  can  disproportionately  affect  commuting  between 
counties within CZs. As a preliminary illustration of the size and heterogeneity of 
these commuting interactions between counties, Figure 1 displays kernel densities 
of the share of residents who work in the same county where they live (the “resi-
dence own commuting share”). In 1960, when the interstate highway system had 
only recently begun to be constructed, US counties were relatively closed, as shown 
by  the  concentration  of  density  at  high  values,  with  the  median  own  commuting 
share equal to 91 percent. Forty years later, the picture is rather different, as shown 
by the marked shift in density toward lower values, with a median own commuting 
share  equal  to  69  percent.3  More  generally,  the  substantial  heterogeneity  in  own 
commuting shares, evident in Figure 1, already suggests that counties are likely to 
differ substantially in the extent to which labor market shocks and policies spill over 
across their boundaries.

We show that our results are robust both theoretically and empirically. From a the-
oretical perspective, we show that heterogeneous local employment elasticities are 
not specific to our theoretical model, but rather are a more generic prediction of an 
entire class of theoretical models consistent with a gravity equation for  commuting 

3 In Figure 1, we measure commuting using the share of residents who work in the same county where they live. 
We show below that this measure is model consistent and it is the only measure available at the county level over the 
entire 1960–2000 period. The distributions for each decade shown in Figure 1 are statistically significantly different 
from those in the decade immediately before using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These shifts in the distribution 
over time are also apparent if we weight counties by residents or use CZs instead of counties (as shown in online 
Appendix Section B.6).

flows. From an empirical perspective, we show that we continue to find substan-
tial heterogeneity in these local employment elasticities when we  incorporate the 
variable land supply elasticities from Saiz (2010). Introducing this second source 
of heterogeneity generates more variation in local resident elasticities but does not 
reduce the variation in local employment elasticities. This pattern of results is intu-
itive. The housing supply elasticity matters less for employment than for residents, 
because  commuting  allows  individuals  to  work  in  locations  with  inelastic  hous-
ing supplies without actually having to live there and pay the resulting high land 
prices. Therefore, a high productivity location with an inelastic housing supply can 
increase employment through commuting without requiring substantial changes in 
the number of residents. An important policy implication is that improvements in 
commuting technologies provide an alternative to the relaxation of housing supply 
elasticities in facilitating the allocation of workers to productive locations. While 
this possibility has been informally discussed in the existing literature on housing 
supply elasticities (as for example in Hsieh and Moretti 2017), we are the first, as 
far as we are aware, to provide quantitative empirical evidence on the relevance of 
commuting for the response of employment to local labor demand shocks.

We provide separate empirical evidence independent of our model for the impor-
tance  of  commuting  for  employment  changes  using  quasi-experimental  variation 
from comparisons of winner and runner-up counties in competitions for million dol-
lar plants (MDPs, following Greenstone, Hornbeck, and Moretti 2010—henceforth 
GHM). As runner-up counties are those that have survived a long selection process 
but narrowly lost the competition, they are likely to provide a better counterfactual 
for a winner county than other comparison counties. We find no evidence of statis-
tically significant differences in employment growth in winner and runner-up coun-
ties prior to the announcement of MDPs, but substantial differences emerge after 
these announcements. Consistent with the predictions of our model, we find greater 
increases in employment from the positive labor demand shock from the opening of 
a MDP in counties with more open commuting markets.4

Having provided this independent evidence in support of commuting as a source of 
heterogeneity in employment responses to local labor demand shocks, we show that 
our model provides a platform for evaluating the counterfactual effects of changes in 
trade and commuting costs. Building on approaches in the international trade liter-
ature (e.g., Head and Ries 2001), we show how observed data on commuting flows 
over time can be used to back out the empirical distribution of implied changes in 
commuting costs. We use this empirical distribution to undertake counterfactuals for 
empirically-plausible changes in commuting costs. For example, reducing commut-
ing costs by the median reduction from 1990–2010 (a reduction of 12 percent), we 
find an increase in welfare of 3.3 percent. The commuting technology facilitates a 
separation of workplace and residence, enabling people to work in high productivity 
locations and live in high amenity locations. Therefore reducing commuting costs 
increases the concentration of employment in locations that were net importers of 

4 These results are consistent with the empirical findings, in another context, of Manning and Petrongolo (2017), 
which shows that local development policies are fairly ineffective in raising local unemployment outflows, because 
labor markets overlap, and the associated ripple effects in applications largely dilute the impact of local stimulus 
across space.

commuters in the initial equilibrium (e.g., Manhattan) and enhances the clustering 
of residents in locations that initially were net exporters of commuters (e.g., parts of 
New Jersey). This logic seems to suggest that commuting might be important only 
for larger cities in the United States, but this is in fact not the case. Although the 
changes in employment as a result of eliminating commuting are well explained by 
initial commuting intensity, this intensity cannot be easily proxied for using empiri-
cal controls such as land area, size, or housing supply elasticities.

Our paper is related to several existing literatures. In international trade, our work 
relates to quantitative models of costly trade in goods following Eaton and Kortum 
(2002)  and  extensions.  Our  research  also  contributes  to  the  economic  geography 
literature on costly trade in goods and factor mobility, which typically uses vari-
ation across regions or systems of cities.5 Our work also contributes to the urban 
economics literature on the costly movement of people (commuting), which typi-
cally uses variation within cities.6 In contrast, we develop a framework in which an 
arbitrary set of regions are connected in both goods markets (through costly trade) 
and  labor  markets (through  migration  and  commuting),  and  which  encompasses 
both within- and across-city interactions. Although incorporating costly goods trade 
and commuting is a natural idea, our first main contribution is to develop a tractable 
framework that captures these forces and is amenable to both analytic and quanti-
tative analysis. Our second main contribution is to quantify this framework using 
disaggregated data on trade and commuting for the United States and to show how 
it provides a platform for evaluating a range of counterfactual interventions. Our 
third main contribution is to establish theoretically and empirically the importance 
of spatial interactions between locations (in particular through commuting) in deter-
mining the local economic effects of local labor demand shocks.
Our paper is also related to the large empirical literature on local labor markets, 
which has estimated the effects of local labor demand shocks.7 Each of the papers 
in this literature is concerned with evaluating the local impact of economic shocks 
using data on finely-detailed spatial units. However, these spatial units are typically 
treated as independent observations in reduced-form regressions, with little atten-
tion paid to the linkages between these spatial units in goods and labor markets, and 
hence with little consideration of the distinction between employment and residents 
introduced by endogenous commuting decisions. A key contribution of our paper is 
to show that understanding these spatial linkages is central to evaluating the local 
impact of these and other economic shocks.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section I develops our the-
oretical framework. Section II discusses the quantification of the model using US 
data  and  reports  summary  statistics  on  commuting  between  counties.  Section  III 
uses the model to quantify the heterogeneity in local employment elasticities across 
US  counties.  Section  IV  presents  independent  evidence  in  support  of  the  impor-
tance of commuting for employment changes using million dollar plants (MDPs). 
Section V undertakes counterfactuals for changes in commuting costs and Section 
VI summarizes our conclusions. An online Appendix contains the derivations of the-
oretical results, the proofs of propositions, additional robustness tests, and a descrip-
tion of the data sources and manipulations.

I.  The Model

We  develop  a  spatial  general  equilibrium  model  in  which  locations  are  linked 
in goods markets through trade and in factor markets through migration and com-
muting. The  economy  consists  of  a  set  of  locations   n, i ∈  N .  Each  location   n   is 
endowed with a supply of land (  H n   ). Following the new economic geography liter-
ature, we begin by interpreting land as geographical land area, which is necessarily 
in perfectly inelastic supply. We later extend our analysis to interpret land as devel-
oped land area, which has a positive supply elasticity that we allow to differ across 
–
    of workers, each of 
locations. The economy as a whole is populated by a measure   L 
whom is endowed with one unit of labor that is supplied inelastically.

A. Preferences and Endowments

Workers are geographically mobile and have heterogeneous preferences for loca-
tions. Each worker chooses a pair of residence and workplace locations to maximize 
her utility taking as given the choices of other firms and workers.8 The preferences 
of a worker  ω  who lives and consumes in location  n  and works in location  i  are 
defined over final goods consumption (  C nω   ), residential land use (  H nω   ), an idiosyn-
cratic amenities shock (  b niω   ), and commuting costs (  κ ni   ), according to the Cobb-
Douglas form,9

(1) 
where   κ ni   ∈ [1, ∞)  is an iceberg commuting cost in terms of utility.10 The idio-
syncratic amenities shock (  b niω   ) captures the idea that individual workers can have 
idiosyncratic reasons for living and working in different locations. We model this 
heterogeneity  in  amenities  following  McFadden (1974)  and  Eaton  and  Kortum 

8 Throughout the following, we use  n  to denote a worker’s location of residence and consumption and  i  to denote

10 Although we model commuting costs in terms of utility, they enter the indirect utility function multiplica-
tively with the wage, which implies that they are proportional to the opportunity cost of time. Therefore, similar 
results hold if commuting costs are instead modeled as a reduction in effective units of labor, as discussed in online 
Appendix Section B.16.

(2002).11 For each worker  ω  living in location  n  and working in location  i  , idiosyn-
cratic amenities (  b niω   ) are drawn from an independent Fréchet distribution,
(2) 
where the scale parameter   B ni    determines the average amenities from living in loca-
tion  n  and working in location  i  , and the shape parameter  ϵ >  1  controls the dis-
persion of amenities. The idiosyncratic amenities shock (  b niω   ) implies that different 
workers make different choices about their workplace and residence locations when 
faced  with  the  same  prices  and  wages. All  workers   ω   residing  in  location   n   and 
working in location  i  receive the same wage and make the same consumption and 
residential land choices. Hence, we suppress the implicit dependence on  ω  except 
where important.12
To isolate the effects of introducing commuting, we model goods consumption as 
in the new economic geography literature. The goods consumption index in location  
n  is a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function of consumption of a contin-
uum of tradable varieties sourced from each location  i  ,

(3) 

  C n   =   [  ∑ i∈N     ∫ 0   M i     c ni    (  j)   ρ  dj]      1 _ ρ   ,   σ =    1 _ 1 − ρ   >  1. 

Utility  maximization  implies  that  equilibrium  consumption  in  location   n   of  each 

variety sourced from location  i  is given by   c ni   (  j ) = α X n    P  n  σ−1   p ni     (  j)    −σ  , where   X n    is 
aggregate expenditure in location  n ;   P n    is the price index dual to (3), and   p ni   (  j)   is the 
“cost inclusive of freight” price of a variety  j  produced in location  i  and consumed 
in location  n .13
Utility  maximization  also  implies  that  a  fraction ( 1 − α )  of  worker  income  is 
spent on residential land. We assume that this land is owned by immobile landlords, 
who receive worker expenditure on residential land as income, and consume only 
goods where they live. This assumption allows us to incorporate general equilibrium 
effects from changes in the value of land, without introducing a mechanical exter-
nality into workers’ location decisions from the local redistribution of land rents.14 
Using this assumption, total expenditure on consumption goods equals the fraction  

11 A long line of research models location decisions using preference heterogeneity, as in Artuç, Chaudhuri, and 
McClaren (2010); Kennan and Walker (2011); Grogger and Hanson (2011); Moretti (2011); and Busso, Gregory, 
and Kline (2013). Modeling individual heterogeneity in terms of productivity rather than preferences results in a 
similar specification, as discussed in online Appendix Section B.15. 
12 Our baseline specification focuses on a single worker type with a Fréchet distribution of idiosyncratic pref-
erences for tractability, which results in similar choice probabilities to the logit model. In online Appendix Section 
B.10, we generalize our analysis to multiple worker types  z  with different Fréchet scale and shape parameters, 
which results in similar choice probabilities to the mixed logit model of McFadden and Train (2000). 
introduce non-traded consumption goods. 

13 In  online Appendix  Section  B.12,  we  show  how  this  standard  specification  can  be  further  generalized  to 

14 In online Appendix Section B.13, we show that the model has similar properties if landlords consume both 
consumption goods and residential land, although expressions are less elegant. In the online Appendix, we also 
report the results of a robustness test, in which we instead assume that land is partially owned locally and partially 
owned by a national portfolio that redistributes land rents to workers throughout the economy (as in Caliendo et 
al. 2018).

  P n   C n   = α   v –   n    R n   +  (1 − α)    v –   n    R n   =   v –   n    R n   ,

the fraction   (1 − α)   of the total income of residents):
(4) 
where    v –   n    is the average labor income of residents across employment locations; and   
R n    is the measure of residents. Land market clearing determines the land price (  Q n   ) 
as a function of the supply of land (  H n   ):
(5) 

  Q n   =  (1 − α)      v –   n    R n   ____  H n     . 

B. Production

Again to isolate the effects of introducing commuting, we model production as in 
the new economic geography literature. Tradable varieties are produced using labor 
under monopolistic competition and increasing returns to scale. To produce a vari-
ety, a firm must incur a fixed cost of  F  and a constant variable cost that depends on 
a location’s productivity   A i   .15 Therefore, the total amount of labor (  l i   (  j) ) required to 
produce   x i   (  j)  units of a variety  j  in location  i  is   l i   (  j) =  F +  x i   (  j)/ A i   .16
Profit  maximization  implies  that  equilibrium  prices  are  a  constant  mark-up 
over  marginal  cost:    p ni   (  j) =  (   σ ____ σ − 1  )     d ni    w i   ___  A i      ,  where    w i     is  the  wage  in  location   i .  
is equal to a constant:   x i   (  j) =  A i  F (σ − 1)  . This constant equilibrium output of each 
variety and labor market clearing together imply that the total measure of produced 
varieties (  M i   ) is proportional to the measure of employed workers (  L i   ),   M i   =  L i  /(σF).  

Combining profit maximization and zero profits, equilibrium output of each variety 

C. Goods Trade

The model implies a gravity equation for bilateral trade between locations. Using 
the  CES  expenditure  function,  the  equilibrium  pricing  rule,  and  the  measure  of 
firms, the share of location  n ’s expenditure on goods produced in location  i  is

  π ni   =   

 M i    p  ni  1−σ  __________   ∑ k∈N    
    M k    p  nk  1−σ    =   

(6) 
Therefore,  trade  between  locations   n   and   i   depends  on  bilateral  trade  costs (  d ni   ) 
in the numerator (“bilateral resistance”) and on trade costs to all possible sources 
of  supply   k   in  the  denominator (“multilateral  resistance”).  Equating  revenue  and 

 L i    ( d ni   w i  / A i  )    1−σ   ________________   ∑ k∈N    
    L k    ( d nk   w k  / A k  )    1−σ    . 

15 We assume a representative firm within each location. However, it is straightforward to generalize the anal-
ysis to introduce firm heterogeneity with an untruncated Pareto productivity distribution following Melitz (2003). 
16 In online Appendix Section B.14, we generalize the production technology to include intermediate inputs 
(as in Krugman and Venables 1995 and Eaton and Kortum 2002), commercial land use, and physical capital. As 
heterogeneous local employment elasticities are a generic prediction of gravity in commuting, they also hold under 
this production structure.

expenditure on goods produced in that location, namely,17

D. Labor Mobility and Commuting

  U niω   =   

Workers are geographically mobile and choose their pair of residence and work-
place locations to maximize their utility. Given our specification of preferences (1), 
the indirect utility function for a worker  ω  residing in location  n  and working in 
location  i  is

Indirect utility is a monotonic function of idiosyncratic amenities (  b niω   ) and these 
amenities  have  a  Fréchet  distribution. Therefore,  the  indirect  utility  for  a  worker 
living  in  location   n   and  working  in  location   i   also  has  a  Fréchet  distribution:  
  G ni   (U) =  e   − Ψ ni   U   −ϵ  ,   where    Ψ ni   =  B ni     ( κ ni    P  n  α   Q  n  1−α )    −ϵ   w  i  ϵ .   Each  worker  selects  the 

bilateral  commute  that  offers  her  the  maximum  utility,  where  the  maximum  of 
Fréchet distributed random variables is itself Fréchet distributed. Using these dis-
tributions of utility, the probability that a worker chooses to live in location  n  and 
work in location  i  is

 b niω    w i   _  κ ni    P  n  α   Q  n  1−α    . 

    ∑ s∈N    

  λ ni   =   

 B ni     ( κ ni    P  n  α   Q  n  1−α )    −ϵ   w  i  ϵ    _______________________    ∑ r∈N    
    B rs     ( κ rs    P  r  α   Q  r  1−α )    −ϵ   w  s  ϵ    ≡    Φ ni   _ Φ   . 

(10) 
Therefore,  the  idiosyncratic  shock  to  preferences    b niω     implies  that  individual 
workers  choose  different  bilateral  commutes  when  faced  with  the  same  prices  
(  P n    ,   Q n    ,   w i   ), commuting costs (  κ ni   ), and location characteristics (  B ni   ). Other things 
equal, workers are more likely to live in location  n  and work in location  i  , the lower 
the consumption goods price index (  P n   ) and land prices (  Q n   ) in  n  , the higher the 

17 Although a location’s total workplace income equals total expenditure on the goods that it produces, total res-
idential income can differ from total workplace income (because of commuting). Therefore, total workplace income 
need not equal total residential expenditure, which implies that total exports need not equal total imports. When we 
take the model to the data, we also allow total residential expenditure to differ from total residential income, which 
provides another reason for trade deficits. Within the model, these two variables can diverge if landlords own land 
in different locations from where they consume. This is how we interpret trade deficits in the empirical section.

wages (  w i   ) in  i  , the more attractive average amenities (  B ni   ), and the lower the com-
muting costs (  κ ni   ).
Summing  these  probabilities  across  workplaces   i   for  a  given  residence   n  ,  we 
obtain  the  overall  probability  that  a  worker  resides  in  location   n  (  λ  n  R   ).  Similarly, 
summing across residences  n  for a given workplace  i  , we obtain the overall proba-
bility that a worker works in location  i  (  λ  i  L  ). So,
   =   ∑ n∈N     λ ni   =   ∑ n∈N       Φ ni   _ Φ   ,  
(11) 
where national labor market clearing corresponds to   ∑ n        λ  n  R  =  ∑ i        λ  i  L  =  1 .
The average income of a worker living in  n  depends on the wages in all the nearby 
employment locations. To construct this average income of residents, note first that 
the probability that a worker commutes to location  i  conditional on living in location  
n  is

   =   ∑ i∈N     λ ni   =   ∑ i∈N       Φ ni   _ Φ   ,  

  λ  n  R  =    R n   __  L 

 λ  i  L  =    L n   __  L

(12) 
Equation (12) implies a commuting gravity equation, with an elasticity of commut-
ing flows with respect to commuting costs (  κ ni   ) of  − ϵ . Therefore, the probability 
of commuting to location  i  conditional on living in location  n  depends on the wage 
(  w i   ), amenities (  B ni   ), and commuting costs (  κ ni   ) for workplace  i  in the numerator 
(“bilateral resistance”), as well as the wage (  w s   ), amenities (  B ns   ), and commuting 
costs (  κ ns   )  for  all  other  possible  workplaces   s   in  the  denominator (“multilateral 
resistance”). This gravity equation prediction is consistent with the existing empir-
ical literature on commuting and migration, including McFadden (1974), Grogger 
and Hanson (2011), and Kennan and Walker (2011). In online Appendix Section 
B.9, we show that heterogeneous local employment elasticities are a generic predic-
tion of the whole class of models consistent with a gravity equation for commuting 
flows.

  L i   =   ∑ n∈N     λ  ni|n  R     R n   .

Using these conditional commuting probabilities, we obtain the following labor 
market clearing condition that equates the measure of workers employed in location  
i  (  L i   ) with the measure of workers choosing to commute to that location, namely,
(13) 
Expected  worker  income  conditional  on  living  in  location   n   is  then  equal  to  the 
wages  in  all  possible  workplaces  weighted  by  the  probabilities  of  commuting  to 
those workplaces conditional on living in  n  , or
   v –   n   =   ∑ i∈N     λ  ni|n  R     w i  . 
(14) 
Hence, expected worker income (   v –   n   ) is high in locations that have low commuting 
costs (low   κ ni   ) to high-wage employment locations.18

18 We treat agents and workers as synonymous, which abstracts from a labor force participation decision, and 
enables us to isolate the implications of introducing commuting into the standard new economic geography model.

Finally, population mobility implies that expected utility is the same for all pairs 
of residence and workplace and equal to expected utility for the economy as a whole. 
That is,
   =  E [ U niω  ]  = Γ (  ϵ − 1 _ ϵ   )   [  ∑ r∈N      ∑ s∈N     B rs     ( κ rs    P  r  α   Q  r  1−α )    −ϵ  w  s  ϵ ]      1 _ ϵ     all n, i ∈  N,  
(15) 
where E is the expectations operator and the expectation is taken over the distribu-
tion for the idiosyncratic component of utility and  Γ( · )  is the Gamma function.
Although expected utility is equalized across all pairs of residence and workplace, 
real wages differ as a result of preference heterogeneity. Workplaces and residences 
face upward-sloping supply functions for workers and residents respectively (the 
choice probabilities (11)). Each workplace must pay higher wages to increase com-
muters’ real income and attract additional workers with lower idiosyncratic ameni-
ties for that workplace. Similarly, each residential location must offer a lower cost 
of living to increase commuters’ real income and attract additional residents with 
lower idiosyncratic amenities for that residence. Bilateral commutes with attractive 
characteristics (high workplace wages and low residence cost of living) attract addi-
tional commuters with lower idiosyncratic amenities, until expected utility (taking 
into account idiosyncratic amenities) is the same across all bilateral commutes.

E. General Equilibrium

–

   =  ∑ n∈N    

    R n   =  ∑ n∈N    
    L n  . 

The general equilibrium of the model can be referenced by the following vector 
of six variables  { w n  ,     v –  n  ,    Q n  ,    L n  ,    R n  ,    P n   }  n=1  N     and a scalar   U 
   . Given this equilibrium 
vector and scalar, all other endogenous variables of the model can be determined. 
This  equilibrium  vector  solves  the  following  6  sets  of  equations:  income  equals 
expenditure (7), average residential income (14), land market clearing (5), work-
place choice probabilities (11 for   L n   ), residence choice probabilities (11 for   R n   ), and 
price indices (8). The last condition needed to determine the scalar   U 
    is the labor 
–
market clearing condition,   L 
In  online Appendix  Section  B.3,  we  provide  conditions  for  the  existence  and 
uniqueness of the general equilibrium. We show that the system of equations for 
general equilibrium in our model can be written in the form required to apply the 
existence and uniqueness results for gravity equation models from Allen, Arkolakis, 
and Li (2016). In developing our model above, we have followed the new economic 
geography literature in modeling agglomeration forces through love of variety and 
increasing returns to scale. In online Appendix Section B.4, we show that our new 
economic geography model is isomorphic to a version of Eaton and Kortum (2002) 
and Redding (2016) with commuting and external economies of scale or a version 
of Armington (1969) with commuting and external economies of scale (as in Allen 
and Arkolakis 2014 and Allen, Arkolakis, and Li 2015).
F. Computing Counterfactuals

We  use  our  quantitative  framework  to  solve  for  the  counterfactual  effects  of 
changes in the exogenous variables of the model (productivity   A n   , amenities   B ni   , 
commuting costs   κ ni   , and trade costs   d ni   ) without having to necessarily determine the 

MONTE ET AL.: COMMUTING, MIGRATION, AND EMPLOYMENTVOL. 108 NO. 123866

unobserved values of these exogenous variables. Instead, in the online Appendix, we 
show that the system of equations for the counterfactual changes in the endogenous 
variables of the model can be written solely in terms of the observed values of vari-
ables in an initial equilibrium (employment   L i   , residents   R i    , workplace wages   w n   ,  
average residential income    v –   n    , trade shares   π ni    , and commuting probabilities   λ ni   ).  
This  approach  uses  observed  bilateral  commuting  probabilities  to  capture  unob-
served bilateral commuting costs and amenities. Similarly, if bilateral trade shares 
between locations are available, they can be used to capture unobserved bilateral 
trade frictions (as in Dekle, Eaton, and Kortum 2007). However, since bilateral trade 
data are only available at a higher level of aggregation than the counties we consider 
in our data, we make some additional parametric assumptions to solve for implied 
bilateral trade shares between counties, as discussed below. Throughout this theo-
retical section, we assume for simplicity that residential income equals expenditure. 
However, when taking the model to the data, we allow for intertemporal trade defi-
cits that are treated as exogenous in our counterfactuals, as in Dekle, Eaton, and 
Kortum (2007) and Caliendo and Parro (2015), as discussed further below. In online 
Appendix  Section  B.17,  we  also  consider  a  world  where  land  is  partially  owned 
locally and partially owned by a national portfolio.

II.  Data and Measurement

Our empirical analysis combines data from a number of different sources for the 
United States.19 From the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), we use data on bilat-
eral trade and distances shipped for 123 CFS regions. Data on bilateral commuting 
between counties come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2006–2010 
(for  our  main  calibration)  and  US  Census  1960–2000 (for  various  other  statis-
tics). From the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), we use data on employment 
and wages by workplace. We combine these data sources with a variety of other 
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data. We use our data on employment and 
commuting to calculate the implied number of residents and their average income 
by  county.  First,  from  commuter  market  clearing (13),  we  obtain  the  number  of 
residents (  R n   ) using data on the number of workers (  L n   ) and commuting probabili-
ties conditional on living in each location (  λ  ni|n  R    ). Second, we use these conditional 
commuting probabilities, together with county wages, to obtain average residential 
income (   v –   n   ) as defined in equation (14).

A. Goods Trade

In the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data, we observe bilateral trade flows and 
distances shipped between 123 CFS regions and trade deficits for each these CFS 
regions.20 To quantify the model at the county level, we allocate the deficit for each 

19 See online Appendix Section D for further discussion of the data sources and definitions. 
20 Other  recent  studies  using  the  CFS  data  include  Caliendo  et  al. (2018);  Duranton,  Morrow,  and  Turner 
(2014);  and  Dingel (2017). The  CFS  is  a  random  sample  of  plant  shipments  within  the  United  States (foreign 
trade shipments are not included). CFS regions are the smallest geographical units for which this random sample 
is representative, which precludes constructing bilateral trade flows between smaller geographical units using the 
sampled shipments. 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWDECEMBER 20183867

  w i    L i   −   ∑ n∈N      

CFS region across the counties within that region according to their shares of CFS 
residential income (as measured by    v –   i    R i   ). Using the resulting trade deficits for each 
county (  D i   ), we solve the equality between income and expenditure (7) for unob-
served county productivities (  A i   ):
 L i     ( d ni    w i  / A i  )    1−σ   ________________   ∑ k∈N    
(16) 
where we observe (or have solved for) wages (  w i   ), employment (  L i   ), average resi-
dential income (   v –   i   ), residents (  R i   ), and trade deficits (  D i   ).
Given the elasticity of substitution ( σ ), our measures for (  w i   ,   L i   ,    v –   i   ,   R i   ,   D i   ), and a 
parameterization of trade costs (  d  ni  1−σ  ), equation (16) provides a system of  N  equa-
tions that can be solved for a unique vector of  N  unobserved productivities (  A i   ), as 
shown formally in Proposition B.1 of the online Appendix. We parameterize bilat-
eral trade costs as a constant elasticity function of distance and a stochastic error  

    L k     ( d nk    w k  / A k  )    1−σ    [  v –   n    R n   +  D n  ]  =  0,  

(  d  ni  1−σ  =  dis t  ni  −ψ(σ−1)    e ̃   ni   ) for all pairs with positive trade, while the model implies 

prohibitive trade costs for pairs with zero trade. We use the model’s gravity equa-
tion and observed bilateral trade between CFS regions to estimate the composite 
parameter  − ψ(σ − 1) = −1.29  , as discussed further in online Appendix Section 
B.5. We assume a central value for the elasticity of substitution between varieties 
from the existing empirical literature of  σ =  4  , which is in line with the estimates 
of this parameter using price and expenditure data in Broda and Weinstein (2006), 
and  implies   ψ =  0.43 . We  use  these  estimated  parameters  and  equation (16)  to 
solve for the unique unobserved productivities (  A i   ) and generate the model’s pre-
dictions for bilateral trade flows between counties (  X ni   ) from equation (6).21 As a 
check on this specification, we aggregate the model’s predictions for trade between 
counties within pairs of CFS regions, and compare these predictions to the data on 
CFS bilateral trade. As shown in online Appendix Section B.5, we find a strong and 
approximately log-linear relationship between the model’s predictions and the data, 
which is tighter for the larger trade values that account for most of aggregate trade.

B. Commuting Flows

We start by providing evidence on the quantitative relevance of commuting as a 
source of spatial linkages between counties and CZs. Our main data source is the 
American Community Survey (ACS), which reports county-to-county worker flows 
for 2006–2010. To abstract from business trips that are not between a worker’s usual 
place of residence and workplace, we define commuting flows as those of less than 
120 kilometers in each direction (a round trip of 240 km).22 We  supplement these 
21 We find that measured productivity (  A i   ) is correlated with observable proxies for productivity, such as access 
to natural water. Regressing  log  A i    on a dummy indicating if a county is in the 10 percent of counties closest to the 
ocean or a navigable river we find positive and statistically significant estimated coefficients (standard errors) of 
0.21 (0.02) for the ocean and 0.03 (0.02) for a navigable river. The data on distances are from Rappaport and Sachs 
(2003). 
22 The majority of commutes are less than 45 minutes in each direction (Duranton and Turner 2011). In our 
analysis, we measure distance between counties’ centroids. We choose the 120 kilometers threshold based on a 
change in slope of the relationship between log commuters and log distance at this distance threshold. See online 
Appendix D.1.2 for further discussion.

data  with  information  on  bilateral  commuting  between  counties  from  the  1990–
2000 population censuses and data on the share of the residents of each county that 
work where they live from the 1960–1980 population censuses.

In Table 1, we report some descriptive statistics on commuting flows from 2006–
2010. We find that commuting beyond county boundaries is substantial and varies 
in importance across locations. For the median county, around 27 percent of its res-
idents work outside the county and around 20 percent of its workers live outside the 
county. For the county at the ninety-fifth percentile, these two figures rise to 59 and 
43 percent respectively. In Table 1, we report unweighted statistics to capture the 
heterogeneity in commuting patterns across geographical locations (counties). As 
we show in online Appendix Section B.6, commuting linkages remain substantial 
and heterogeneous if we instead weight counties by residents to capture heteroge-
neity across residents.
The share of residents who work where they live (the “residence own commut-
ing share,”   λ  ii|i  R   ) and the share of workers who live where they work (the “work-
place own commuting share,”   λ  ii|i  L   ) can be related to one another and the ratio of 
employment to residents (  L i  / R i   ) using the commuter market clearing condition (see 
online Appendix Section B.7). Both commuting measures are intuitive and they are 
inversely related to the flow of either residents or workers from other locations. We 
find that these two measures are positively correlated with one another, as reflected 
in a statistically significant correlation of 0.60 from 2006 to 2010.23 We choose the 
residence own commuting share (  λ  ii|i  R   ) as our baseline measure since it is both model 
consistent and available in the population census back to 1960. But we show that our 
results are robust to using either measure, or the average or minimum of these two 
measures, for the years for which both measures are available.
These differences in openness to commuting imply substantial variation across 
counties in the ratio of employment to residents (  L i  / R i   ), which is greater than 1 for 

23 Although  Figure  1  shows  that  counties  have  become  increasingly  open  to  commuting  over  time,  we  also 
find that relative openness to commuting is strongly persistent across counties over time. Correlating the share of 
residents that work outside the county where they live (  λ   R  ) in 2000 with the corresponding values for each previous 
decade back to 1960, we find correlations of 0.96, 0.91, 0.84, and 0.73 respectively. 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWDECEMBER 20183869

counties that import commuters and less than 1 for those that export commuters. 
This ratio ranges from 0.60 at the fifth percentile to 1.18 at the ninety-fifth percentile 
(third row, columns 2 and 8 respectively).24
One  might  think  that  using  commuting  zones (CZs)  circumvents  the  need  to 
incorporate  commuting  into  the  analysis,  since  the  boundaries  of  these  areas  are 
drawn to minimize commuting flows. Nevertheless, we find that CZs provide only 
an imperfect measure of local labor markets, with substantial commuting beyond 
CZ boundaries that again varies in importance across locations. For the median CZ, 
around 7 percent of its residents work outside the CZ and around 7 percent of its 
workers  live  outside  the  CZ.  For  the  CZ  at  the  ninety-fifth  percentile,  these  two 
figures rise to 22 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Although the ratio of employ-
ment to residents ( L/R ) by construction varies less across CZs than across counties, 
we still find substantial variation from a minimum of 0.63 to a maximum of 1.12 
(final row), which we show below is sufficient to generate substantial heterogene-
ity in local employment elasticities. To provide a point of comparison to Figure 1 
for  counties,  online Appendix  Figure  B.4  shows  kernel  densities  of  the  share  of 
residents that work in the same CZ where they live for 1990 and 2000. We find the 
same pattern of an increase in commuting openness over time. In online Appendix 
Section B.6, we also show that we continue to find substantial variation in commut-
ing linkages across CZs if we weight them by residents to capture heterogeneity 
across residents.
We now use our model’s prediction of a gravity equation for bilateral commuting 
probabilities, which using land market clearing (5) and the price index (8) can be 
written as

where    ni   ≡  B ni    κ  ni  −ϵ   is a composite parameter that captures the ease of commuting.
Given  the  preference  heterogeneity  parameter (ϵ)  and  our  measures  for (  L n    ,   
π nn    ,   w n    ,   v n    ,   R n    ,   H n   ), equation (17) provides a  N × N  system of equations that can 
be  solved  for  a  unique  matrix  of   N × N   values  of  the  ease  of  commuting (   ni),    
as shown in online Appendix Proposition B.2. We model the ease of commuting  
(   ni   ) for all pairs with positive commuting flows as depending on (i) a residence 
component (   n   ), (ii) a workplace component (   i   ), (iii) a component that is related 
to distance (  dist  ni  −ϕ  ), and (iv) an orthogonal component (   ni   ), such that    ni   =   n    
 i    dist  ni  −ϕ    ni    , where the model implies prohibitive commuting costs for pairs with 
zero commuting flows. We estimate the parameter  ϕ =  4.43  in a first step using the 
model’s gravity equation predictions for bilateral commuting flows and including 
workplace  and  residence  fixed  effects. We  estimate  the  heterogeneity  in  location 

24 In online Appendix Section B.6, we show that the ratio of employment to residents is not only heterogeneous 
across counties, but is also hard to explain with standard empirical controls, such as land area, size, or supply elas-
ticities for developed land.

preferences ( ϵ =  3.30 )  in  a  second  step  by  using  the  structure  of  the  model  to 
replace the workplace fixed effects with wages raised to this power. In this second 
step, we instrument wages using productivity to address the fact that wages them-
selves depend on commuting flows, as discussed further in online Appendix Section 
B.6. We find that the gravity equation provides a good approximation to observed 
bilateral commuting flows, and the higher estimated distance coefficient for com-
muting than goods trade (−4.43 versus −1.29) is in line with the idea that transport-
ing people is more costly than transporting goods.
For  the  one  remaining  model  parameter,  the  share  of  housing  in  consumer 
expenditure,  we  assume  a  central  value  from  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis  of  
1 − α =  0.40   percent.25  Using  our  assumption  of  Cobb-Douglas  utility  and  our 
interpretation of land as geographical land area, in online Appendix Section C.1, we 
show that the model’s predictions for land prices are strongly positively correlated 
with observed county median housing values. In the next section, we also relax these 
assumptions to introduce a positive supply elasticity for developed land.

III.  Local Employment Elasticities

To provide evidence on local employment elasticities, we compute 3,111 coun-
terfactual exercises where we shock each county with a 5 percent productivity shock 
(holding productivity in all other counties and holding all other exogenous variables 
constant).26 Figure 2 shows the estimated kernel density for the distribution of the 
general equilibrium elasticity of employment with respect to the productivity shock 
across these treated counties (solid line). We also show the 95 percent confidence 
intervals around this estimated kernel density (gray shading). The mean estimated 
local employment elasticity of around 1.52 is greater than 1 because of home market 
effects and commuting. Around this mean, we find substantial heterogeneity in the 
predicted effects of the productivity shock, which vary from close to 0.5 to almost 
2.5. This variation is surprisingly large. It implies that taking a local employment 
elasticity estimated for one group of counties and applying that  elasticity to another 
group of counties can lead to substantial discrepancies between the true and pre-
dicted impacts of a productivity shock.

To provide a point of comparison, Figure 2 also includes the general equilibrium 
elasticity of residents in a county with respect to the same 5 percent productivity 
shock in that county (again holding other parameters constant). Again we show the 
estimated kernel density across the 3,111 treated counties (dashed line) and the 95 
percent confidence intervals (gray shading). We find substantial differences between 
the employment and residents elasticities, with the residents elasticity having less 
dispersion  and  ranging  from  around  0.2  to  1.2.  Since  employment  and  residents 
can  only  differ  through  commuting,  this  by  itself  suggests  that  the  heterogeneity 
in the local employment elasticity is largely driven by commuting links between 

25 Using these assumed parameter values, we correlate our measures of residential amenities with observable 
proxies for this variable. We regress the solutions for the bilateral ease of commuting (   ni   ) from equation (17) on 
residence and workplace fixed effects and bilateral distance. We use the residence fixed effect as our measure of 
residential amenities. Regressing this measure on violent crimes per resident, we find a negative and statistically 
significant coefficient (standard error) of −0.48 (0.10). Crime data are from the US Department of Justice (2007). 
26 We have experimented with shocks of 1 percent and 10 percent as well, with essentially unchanged results.

counties. In online Appendix Section C.6, we provide further evidence that this is 
indeed the case by simulating productivity shocks in a counterfactual world without 
commuting between counties. Even in such a counterfactual world, we expect local 
employment elasticities to be heterogeneous, because counties differ substantially 
in terms of their initial shares of US employment. However, we find substantially 
less heterogeneity in local employment elasticities in this counterfactual world than 
in the actual world with commuting. In fact, the resulting distribution of employment 
(and resident) elasticities is similar to the one for resident elasticities in Figure 2.
This heterogeneity in local employment elasticities remains if we shock counties 
with patterns of spatially correlated shocks reproducing the industrial composition 
of the US economy (see online Appendix Section C.4). We also find a similar pat-
tern of results if we replicate our entire quantitative analysis for CZs rather than 
counties (see online Appendix Section C.11). Both sets of results are consistent with 
the fact that heterogeneous local employment elasticities are a generic prediction of 
a gravity equation for commuting (as shown in online Appendix Section B.9).

A. Explaining the Heterogeneity in Local Employment Elasticities

When we undertake our counterfactual exercises, we solve for the full general 
equilibrium effect of the productivity shock to each county. To provide intuition for 
the determinants of these local employment elasticities, in Table 2, we examine the 
relationship between these general equilibrium elasticities and a range of observed 
variables. In column 1, we regress our general equilibrium elasticities on a constant, 
which captures the mean employment elasticity across the 3,111 treated counties. 
In columns 2–4, we attempt to explain the heterogeneity in local employment elas-
ticities using standard county controls. In column 2 we include log county employ-
ment as a control for the size of economic activity in a county. In column 3 we also

include log county wages and log county land area. In column 4 we also include the 
average wage and total employment in neighboring counties. Although these con-
trols are all typically statistically significant, we find that they are not particularly 
successful in explaining the variation in employment elasticities. Adding a constant 
and all these controls yields an R2 of only about 0.5 in column 4. Clearly, there is 
substantial variation not captured by these controls.

In the remaining columns of the table we attempt to explain the heterogeneity 
in local employment elasticities using our commuting measures derived from the 
model. In column 5, we include the residence own commuting share (  λ  ii|i  R   ) as our 
baseline measure of commuting linkages.27 The more open the local labor market to 
commuting, the lower the value of   λ  ii|i  R    , and the higher the local employment elastic-
ity. This is exactly what we find in column 5. Furthermore, this variable alone yields 
a  R2  of  0.89,  substantially  higher  than  including  all  of  the  standard  econometric 

27 See online Appendix Section B.8 for the derivation our baseline measure and the partial equilibrium elastic-

ities we use below.

controls.28 We find a similar pattern of results using the workplace own commut-
ing share (  λ  ii|i  L   ) and the average or minimum of the residence and workplace own 
commuting  shares.  Therefore,  although  our  model  incorporates  several  forms  of 
spatial linkages (including trade and migration), we find that the heterogeneity in 
local employment elasticities is mainly explained by commuting linkages, which is 
consistent with our gravity equation estimates, where commuting is substantially 
more local than goods trade.

Even more of the heterogeneity in local employment elasticities can be explained 
using the partial equilibrium elasticities derived from the model in online Appendix 
Section  B.8.  In  column  6  we  relate  the  variation  in  local  employment  elastic-
ities  to  the  measure  of  commuting  linkages  implied  by  these  partial  equilibrium 
   (1 −  λ  ni|n  R   )  ϑ ni    ,  where    ϑ ni   ≡  λ  ni|n  R     R n  / L i     is  the  share  of  commut-
elasticities,    ∑ n∈N    
ers  from  residence   n   in  workplace   i ’s  employment. We  also  add  the  correspond-
ing  implied  measures  of  migration  and  trade  linkages,    ( λ ii  / λ Ri   −  λ Li  )    and     ∂  w i   ___ ∂  A i        A i   __  w i     .  
Including these partial equilibrium measures further increases the R2 to around 93 
percent of the variation in the general equilibrium elasticity. Counties that account 
for a small share of commuters (small   λ  ni|n  R    ) from their main suppliers of commuters 
(high    ϑ ni   )  have  higher  employment  elasticities.  In  column  7,  we  use  the  product 
of    ∂  w i   ___ ∂  A i        A i   __  w i      and the first two terms rather than each term separately. This restriction 

yields similar results and confirms the importance of commuting linkages and, to a 
lesser extent, the interaction between migration and goods linkages. Finally, in the 
last two columns we combine these partial equilibrium elasticities with the standard 
controls we used in the first four columns. Clearly, although all variables are signif-
icant, these standard controls add little once we control for the partial equilibrium 
elasticities.29

We now compare our general equilibrium elasticities of employment with respect 
to the productivity shock in the model to reduced-form “difference-in-differences” 
estimates of the local average treatment effects of the productivity shock. We con-
struct a regression sample including both treated and untreated counties from our 
3,111 counterfactuals in which we shock each county in turn with a 5 percent posi-
tive productivity shock ( 3, 111   2  =  9,678,321  observations). For each of these sepa-
rate exercises, we estimate a “difference-in-differences” specification given by
(18) 
where  i  denotes the 3,111 counties and  t  indexes the 3,111 counterfactuals;  Δ ln  Y it    
is the change in log employment between the counterfactual and actual equilibria;   
I it    is a (0, 1) indicator for whether a county is treated with a productivity shock; and   
X it    are controls. We again consider two sets of controls (  X it   ): the model-suggested 

 Δ ln Y it   =  a 0   +  a 1    I it   +  a 2    X it   +  a 3   ( I it   ×  X it  )  +  u it  , 

28 To provide further evidence on the magnitude of these effects, online Appendix Table C.1 reports the same 
regressions as in Table 2 but using standardized coefficients. We find that a one standard deviation change in the 
own commuting share (  λ  ii|i  R   ) leads to around a one standard deviation change in the local employment elasticity. 
29 In online Appendix Section B.9, we report kernel density estimates for the distribution of the partial equi-
   (1 −  λ  ni|n  R   )   ϑ ni    that is a generic prediction of any commuting gravity 
librium measure of commuting linkages   ∑ n∈N    
equation. We show a similar distribution of heterogeneous local employment elasticities to that in Figure 2, again 
confirming that this heterogeneity is driven by commuting linkages. 

MONTE ET AL.: COMMUTING, MIGRATION, AND EMPLOYMENTVOL. 108 NO. 123874

measures of linkages in goods and factor markets and more standard econometric 
controls (log  employment,  log  wages,  and  land  area). We  include  both  the  main 
effects of these controls (captured by   a 2   ) and their interactions with the treatment 
indicator to capture heterogeneity in the treatment effects (captured by   a 3   ).
In a specification without the controls (  a 2   =  a 3   =  0 ), the average effect of the 
productivity shock on the untreated counties is captured in the regression constant 
(  a 0   ),  and  the  local  average  treatment  effect (  a 1   )  corresponds  to  the  difference  in 
means between the treated and untreated counties. In specifications with controls,   
a 2    captures the main effect of these controls, and   a 3    allows the response of employ-
ment to the productivity shock to depend on these controls. We compare estimating 
this regression specification including (i) a random untreated county in the control 
group, (ii) only the nearest untreated county in the control group, (iii) only neigh-
boring counties within 120 km of the treated county in the control group, (iv) only 
non-neighboring counties located from 120–240 km from the treated county, and 
(v) all untreated counties in the control group.
In online Appendix Section C.3, we show that the model-suggested controls are 
more successful in explaining the heterogeneity in treatment effects than standard 
empirical controls from the local labor markets literature. In general, we find similar 
patterns of results across the different control groups. The one exception is the spec-
ification using the nearest county as a control, because employment in the nearest 
untreated county is typically negatively affected by the increase in productivity in 
the treated county. While the use of contiguous locations to take differences is often 
motivated based on similar unobservables (as in regression discontinuity designs), 
this pattern of results highlights that contiguous locations are also likely to be the 
most severely affected by spatial equilibrium linkages in goods and factor markets.
In sum, Table 2 shows that the heterogeneity in partial equilibrium elasticities 
is not well explained by standard county controls. In contrast, adding our baseline 
measure of the openness of the labor market to commuting, or the partial equilib-
rium elasticities derived from the model, can go a long way toward explaining this 
heterogeneity. Therefore, while capturing the full general equilibrium effects of the 
productivity shocks requires solving the model-based counterfactuals, we find that 
augmenting  “difference-in-differences”  regressions  with  measures  of  commuting 
linkages captures in a reduced-form way the heterogeneity in the estimated treat-
ment effects.

B. Robustness

We now report the results of a number of robustness checks. In the baseline ver-
sion of the model, we interpret the non-traded good as geographical land, which 
is  necessarily  in  perfectly  inelastic  supply.  We  now  develop  an  extension  of  the 
model, in which we interpret the non-traded good as “developed” land and allow for 
a positive developed land supply elasticity that can differ across locations. In par-
ticular, we introduce a positive developed land supply elasticity by following Saiz 
(2010) in assuming that the supply of land (  H n   ) for each residence  n  depends on the 
 endogenous price of land (  Q n   ) as well as on the exogenous characteristics of locations  
   n   ), as discussed further in online Appendix Section C.5.

We use the empirical estimates of developed land supply elasticities from Saiz 
(2010),  which  are  based  on  physical  and  regulatory  constraints  to  the  geograph-
ical  expansion  of  developed  land  area.  Physical  constraints  are  measured  using 
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data on the location of bodies of water 
(oceans and lakes) and wetlands and the elevation of terrain (the fraction of sur-
rounding land that has a slope above 15 percent). Regulatory constraints are mea-
sured using the Wharton Residential Urban Land Regulation Index, which captures 
the stringency of residential growth controls. Using these data, Saiz (2010) estimates 
developed land supply elasticities for 95 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in 
the United States. The population-weighted average of these land supply elasticities 
is 1.75, and they range from 0.76 for the tenth ranked MSA (San Jose, CA) to 3.09 
for the eighty-fifth ranked MSA (Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, NC-SC).
To calibrate the model to the initial distribution of economic activity, we need to 
assume a housing supply elasticity for each county. Therefore, we need to decide 
what to assume about counties that are not part of MSAs and how to treat coun-
ties within multi-county MSAs. The Saiz estimates are based on the expansion of 
the  geographical  frontier  of  developed  land  around  the  boundaries  of  the  MSA. 
Counties that are not part of MSAs can expand this geographical frontier, and hence 
we assume the maximum housing supply elasticity across MSAs for these counties. 
In MSAs that consist of multiple counties, central counties that are surrounded by 
other already-developed counties cannot expand this geographical frontier. Hence, 
we assume a housing supply elasticity of zero for these central counties. Single-
county MSAs and outlying counties in multi-county MSAs have the estimated Saiz 
elasticity.30

When  we  undertake  counterfactuals  for  productivity  shocks,  we  focus  on  the 
subsample of counties within MSAs for which Saiz housing supply elasticities are 
available and no imputation is required. We shock each county in this subsample 
with a 5 percent productivity shock (holding productivity in all other counties and 
holding all other exogenous variables constant). Figure 3 displays the results across 
this subsample of counties. The dark solid line shows the estimated kernel density 
for  the  general  equilibrium  employment  elasticity  using  the  Saiz  housing  supply 
elasticities. The light solid line shows the analogous kernel density for the employ-
ment elasticity for this same subsample of counties assuming an inelastic housing 
supply.  The  dark  dashed  line  shows  the  estimated  kernel  density  for  the  general 
equilibrium resident elasticity using the Saiz housing supply elasticities. The light 
dashed line shows the analogous kernel density for the resident elasticity for this 
same subsample of counties assuming an inelastic housing supply. We also show 
the 95 percent confidence intervals around these estimated kernel densities (gray 
shading).
Comparing these two sets of results, we find that introducing differences in hous-
ing  supply  elasticities  across  locations  shifts  both  distributions  to  the  right.  The 
reason is that the productivity shock now induces an increase in the supply of hous-
ing, which implies a smaller increase in land prices and wages, and hence a larger 

30 In robustness checks, we considered variations in these assumptions, such as assuming the minimum housing 
supply elasticity across MSAs for central counties. Again, we find the same pattern of heterogeneous local employ-
ment elasticities.

increase in both residents and employment in response to the productivity shock. 
We  also  find  that  introducing  differences  in  housing  supply  elasticities  increases 
the heterogeneity in the elasticity of residents with respect to labor demand shocks, 
but has relatively little impact on the heterogeneity in the elasticity of employment. 
This pattern of results is also intuitive. The housing supply elasticity matters less for 
employment than for residents, because commuting allows individuals to work in 
locations with inelastic housing supplies without actually having to live there and 
pay the resulting high land prices. Therefore, a productivity shock in a location with 
an inelastic housing supply can increase employment through commuting without 
requiring substantial changes in the number of residents. An important implication 
is that improvements in commuting technologies provide an alternative approach to 
relaxing housing supply elasticities in enabling individuals to access high produc-
tivity locations.

In online Appendix Section C.5, we provide further evidence that our finding in 
Table 2 that commuting linkages are important for explaining the variation in local 
employment elasticities is robust to controlling for differences in housing supply 
elasticities. We also undertake a range of other robustness checks. In Section C.4, 
we show that we find a similar pattern of heterogeneous local employment elastici-
ties if we use spatially correlated shocks reproducing the industrial composition of 
the US economy. In Section C.11, we show that we obtain the same pattern of find-
ings if we replicate our entire quantitative analysis using CZs rather than counties.

IV.  Million Dollar Plants

We  now  provide  separate  empirical  evidence  independent  of  our  model  for 
the importance of commuting in shaping the employment response to local labor 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWDECEMBER 20183877

demand shocks. We follow GHM in using the location decisions of million dollar 
plants (MDP) as a source of variation in local labor demand.31 A key challenge in 
evaluating  the  effects  of  such  local  labor  demand  shocks  is  constructing  a  coun-
terfactual for what would have happened in the absence of the shock. To address 
this challenge, GHM use the revealed rankings of profit-maximizing firms. These 
rankings come from the corporate real estate journal Site Selection, which includes 
a regular feature titled the “Million Dollar Plants” that describes how a large plant 
decided where to locate. The “Million Dollar Plants” articles report the county that 
the plant ultimately chose (i.e., the winner), as well as the one or two runner-up 
counties (i.e., the losers). The losers are counties that have survived a long selection 
process, but narrowly lost the competition. Therefore, the identifying assumption 
is  that  the  losers  form  a  valid  counterfactual  for  the  winners,  conditional  on  the 
controls.
In an initial study using county-level data, Greenstone and Moretti (2004) con-
sidered a list of 82 MDPs from Site Selection. In a subsequent study of the impact 
of  MDPs  on  other  plants,  GHM  focused  on  a  subset  of  47  plants  that  could  be 
found in confidential Census microdata. In our analysis of the local employment 
response  to  labor  demand  shocks,  we  follow  Greenstone  and  Moretti (2004)  in 
using  county-level data and the full list of 82 MDPs. For each of these 82 groups of 
winner and runner-up counties (referred to as cases), we construct county-level data 
on employment and other characteristics from 10 years before the MDP announce-
ment to 10 years afterward. The resulting sample includes 166 winner and runner-up 
counties from 39 states from 1972 to 2003, where each case can have more than 2 
counties (more than one runner up), and a single county can be associated with more 
than 1 case. To the extent that some of these announced plants need not have actu-
ally opened, this will attenuate the estimates, making the true effects even larger. 
Although the size of the labor demand shock can differ across cases, because the 
MDPs are not all exactly the same size, the very fact that these plants appeared in 
Site Selection as MDPs necessarily implies that they are all large plants.

In online Appendix Table C.3, we compare the observed characteristics of winner 
and runner-up counties before a MDP announcement for the full set of 82 MDPs. 
We find that winner counties have somewhat lower prior values of levels of employ-
ment, wages, population, and population density than runner-up counties. We also 
find  that  they  have  somewhat  more  open  local  labor  markets  in  terms  of  work-
place and residence own commuting shares. Despite these differences in individual 
observed characteristics, the fact that the firms selected these counties as winners 
and runners-up suggests that they have similar implied profitability for plant loca-
tion. As a check on this identifying assumption that the losers form a valid coun-
terfactual for the winners, we now use an event-study specification following GHM 
and Greenstone and Moretti (2004), which allows us to trace in a flexible way the 
evolution of relative employment levels in winning counties relative to runner-up 
counties in the years leading up to and following the MDP announcement.32 We 
estimate

31 See online Appendix Section D.2 for further discussion of the data sources for this section. 
32 This event-study specification for county employment is analogous to that for incumbent plant productivity 

reported in the lower panel of Figure 1 in GHM.

where we use notation as close as possible to GHM;  i  indexes counties;  j  denotes

for the treatment, which equals 1 for a case  j  from the treatment year onward and 0 
otherwise;   T τ    is an indicator variable for years relative to the treatment year, which 
equals 1 for year  τ  and 0 otherwise;   W i    is an indicator variable for the winner county,

We report standard errors clustered by state, which allows for serial correlation in 
the error term within counties over time and spatial correlation in the error term 
across counties within states.34

In this event-study specification, the county fixed effects control for unobserved 
heterogeneity across counties; the case fixed effects control for unobserved determi-
nants of employment that affect both winning and runner-up counties during the ten-
year period around each MDP announcement; and the calendar year fixed effects 
control for secular trends in employment over time. The coefficient  κ  captures the 
average change in employment in both winner and runner-up counties following the 
announcement of a MDP. This coefficient is separately identified from the calen-
dar year fixed effects, because the treatment year occurs in different calendar years 
for different cases. The key coefficients of interest are   θ τ    , which capture a “differ-
ence-in-differences”: the difference in log employment for a winner county between 
the treatment year ( τ =  0 ) and another year compared to the same difference for a 
runner-up county.
In Figure 4, we display the estimates of   θ τ    from equation (19) and their 95 per-
cent confidence intervals. Prior to the MDP announcement, we find no evidence of 
 statistically significant differences in employment between winner and runner-up 
counties. In the treatment year in which a MDP is announced ( τ =  0 ), we find an 
increase  in  employment  in  treatment  counties  relative  to  control  counties,  which 
becomes  statistically  significant  at  the  5  percent  level  by  the  first  year  after  the 
announcement ( τ =  1 ), and continues to increase in magnitude from there onward. 
By 10 years after the MDP announcement, employment in winner counties is on 
average close to 4 percent larger than in runner-up counties. This pattern of results 
is  consistent  with  the  MDP  announcement  gradually  leading  to  an  expansion  in 
employment in winner counties relative to runner-up counties, through the direct 
effects of the construction, operation, and expansion of the MDP, and through the 
indirect effects of the construction, operation, and expansion of suppliers and ancil-
lary services. Therefore, the timing of the positive estimated treatment effect in this 
event study provides support for the MDP identifying assumptions.

33 While GHM includes industry-year effects in its plant-level specifications, we include year fixed effects in 
our baseline county-level specifications, because unlike plants counties do not have a straightforward allocation to 
industries. We report robustness tests below using industry-year fixed effects based on assigning an industry for 
each case, census-region-year fixed effects and state-year fixed effects. 

34 While we prefer to cluster by state to allow for serial correlation across counties within states, we find a sim-

ilar pattern of results if we instead cluster by county.

Having validated the MDP experiment, we now use it to provide evidence on the 
key prediction of our model that the treatment effect of the MDP should be hetero-
geneous across cases depending on openness to commuting. In particular, we gen-
eralize the baseline “difference-in-differences” specification in GHM35 to include 
an interaction term between the treatment effect for a MDP and the openness of the 
local labor market to commuting:

where   λ  ii|i  R    is the residence own commuting share in 1990; the other variables are 
defined as in equation (19); the main effect of   λ  ii|i  R    is captured in the county fixed 
effects (  α i   );  β  allows the average change in employment in both winner and run-
ner-up counties following the announcement of a MDP to depend on the residence 
own commuting share;  θ  captures the mean increase in employment in the  winner 
county  relative  to  the  runner-up  counties  following  a  MDP  announcement  for  a 
completely  open  local  labor  market (  λ  ii|i  R   =  0 );  and   γ   allows  the  mean  increase 
in employment in the winner county relative to the runner-up counties following a 
MDP announcement to depend on the residence own commuting share. If we impose

β = γ =  0   in  equation (20),  we  obtain  the  baseline  “ difference-in-differences 
specification” in GHM.
Table 3 reports the estimation results, where we weight county observations by 
population at the beginning of the sample. In column 1, we impose  β = γ =  0  , 
and estimate that a MDP increases county employment by 5.7 percent, which is sta-
tistically significant at the 1 percent level. The magnitude of this estimated  treatment 
is broadly in line with the county-level results reported in Table 9 of GHM. Our 
estimate  for  employment  is  somewhat  larger  than  their  estimates  for  wages (2.7 
percent) but somewhat smaller that their estimates for the number of manufacturing 
plants (12.6  percent)  and  manufacturing  output (14.5  percent).  Our  employment 
data are for all sectors (including non-manufacturing), whereas most MDPs are in 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWDECEMBER 20183881

manufacturing, which plausibly explains why our employment estimate is smaller 
than the estimates using manufacturing sector outcomes in GHM.36
In column 2, we augment column 1 with our interaction terms for the residence 
own  commuting  share (  λ  ii|i  R   ).  Consistent  with  the  predictions  of  our  theoretical 
model, we find a negative estimated coefficient on the commuting interaction term  
( γ <  0 ), implying greater increases in employment in response to the positive labor 
demand shock in counties with more open local labor markets (lower   λ  ii|i  R   ). In con-
trast, we find no effect of residence own commuting shares in runner-up counties 
(we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that  β  is equal to 0), which is consistent 
with runner-up counties not experiencing a labor demand shock from the opening of 
a MDP. In columns 3–5, we show that this finding of a greater employment response 
in more open commuting markets is robust across our different commuting measures, 
including workplace (column 3), the average of workplace and residence (column 
4), and the minimum of workplace and residence (column 5). These estimates are 
not only statistically significant but also economically relevant. Using our baseline 
estimates from column 2, the standardized coefficient for our interaction term ( γ ) 
with the residence own commuting share is −0.050, which is close in absolute value 
to the standardized coefficient for the main effect ( θ ) of 0.067.37 Comparing the esti-
mated coefficients for the main effect ( θ ) and commuting interaction ( γ ) in columns 
2–8, we find that the opening of a MDP has little effect on employment in counties 
that are completely closed to commuting (those with an own commuting share equal 
to one). This pattern of results is consistent with a relatively inelastic labor supply 
in the absence of commuting. Furthermore, the negative estimated coefficient on the 
commuting interaction term ( γ <  0 ) suggests that the increase in employment in 
the treated counties comes at the expense of reduced employment in neighboring 
counties, as more workers are induced to commute to the treated county from those 
neighboring counties.38

In columns 6–8, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across alternative 
possible specifications. In column 6, we address potential concerns about hetero-
geneous industry trends by replacing the year fixed effects with industry-year fixed 
effects.39  In  columns  7  and  8,  we  examine  potential  concerns  of  heterogeneous 
trends across different geographical regions by replacing the year fixed effects with 
census-region-year  fixed  effects  and  state-year  fixed  effects  respectively.  Across 
all 3 specifications, we continue to find larger employment responses to the labor 
demand shock in more open commuting markets, with estimated coefficients around 
the same magnitude as in our baseline specification in column 2.
As  a  final  check  for  pre-trends,  we  generalize  the  event-study  specification  in 
equation (19) to allow the coefficient on the interaction term with the own commut-
ing share to vary over time. In particular, we estimate a separate main effect of the 
treatment (  θ τ   ), a separate effect of commuting openness (  β τ   ) and a separate effect

In Figure 5, we display the estimated coefficients on the commuting openness 
interaction (  γ τ   ) for each year  τ . Prior to the MDP announcement, we find that these 
estimated coefficients are flat and not statistically significantly different from zero. 
Following the MDP announcement, we find that these estimated coefficients turn 
sharply negative, and although they are imprecisely estimated, they become statis-
tically significantly different zero at conventional levels of significance. Therefore, 
this time pattern of the estimated coefficients on the commuting interaction provides 
evidence against pre-trends, and provides further support for our interpretation that 
commuting openness shapes the employment response to the local labor demand 
shock from the MDP.

Although  our  model  points  to  commuting  linkages  as  the  source  of  heteroge-
neity in the treatment effect of a MDP, another potential concern is that the treat-
ment effect could vary with other location characteristics. To address this concern, 
we now consider a nonparametric specification that estimates a separate treatment 
effect for each case,

where all variables are defined in the same way as in equation (20); the key coef-
ficient of interest is   θ j    , which captures the increase in employment in the winner 
county in case  j  following the MDP announcement relative to the same increase for 
the runners-up.40

In  online Appendix  Figure  C.8,  we  display  the  estimated  treatment  effects  for 
each case, which range from negative values to just below 1. Therefore, although the 
average estimated treatment effect is positive, there is substantial variation around 
this average. As a result, we reject the null hypothesis that these estimated treatment 
effects are all equal to the same common value at conventional levels of significance 
(  p-value 0.000). To provide further evidence on the determinants of this heterogene-
ity, we regress these estimated treatment effects for each case on a range of observed 
characteristics. We measure these observed characteristics for each case as the aver-
age of the values for the winner and runner-up counties. We weight the observations 
on the 82 cases in these regressions by the inverse of the standard errors with which 
the treatment effects are estimated. We cluster the standard errors in these regres-
sions on the states in which treatment and control counties are located for each case.
In Table 4, we report the results from these regressions. Consistent with our ear-
lier results in Table 3, we again find greater employment increases in response to 
the positive labor demand shock in local labor markets that are more open to com-
muting. Across columns 1–4, we find negative and statistically coefficients for our 
4 (inverse) measures of openness to commuting. In columns 5–8, we show that we 
find a similar pattern of results if we also control for log population and log land 
area. Although in some cases, land area or population are statistically significant, 
these correlations are not robust across specifications. Therefore, the heterogeneity 
in estimated treatment effects indeed appears to be related to the openness of the 
local labor market to commuting rather than size or population density.

In online Appendix Section C.8, we provide further evidence on the contribu-
tion of commuting to employment changes using shift-share decompositions. We 
decompose  both  cross-section  and  time-series  variation  in  employment  into  the 
contributions  of (i)  own  residents  holding  own  commuting  shares  constant; (ii) 
own commuting holding own residents constant; (iii) other residents holding other 
commuting  shares  constant;  and (iv)  other  commuting  shares  holding  other  resi-
dents constant. In both the cross-section and time-series, we find that each of these 
terms are quantitatively relevant for the observed variation in employment, and that 
their contributions are heterogeneous across counties. As the observed variation in 
employment  is  ultimately  driven  by  differences  in  productivity  and  other  county 
characteristics, these findings are in line with the predictions of our model that the 
response  of  employment  to  these  underlying  shocks  is  shaped  by  heterogeneous 
patterns of commuting. They are also consistent with our other evidence on the rele-
vance of commuting from the variation across counties in the share of residents who 
work in the county where they live, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.

40 The treatment effect for each case is estimated relative to an excluded category, which is the runner-up coun-

ties for each case. We are therefore able to estimate a treatment effect for each case.

V.  Changes in Commuting Costs

Having provided independent empirical evidence that commuting linkages mat-
ter for the local impact of labor demand shocks, we now use our quantitative model 
to show that they also matter for the aggregate spatial distribution of economic activ-
ity and welfare. Commuting enables workers to access high productivity locations 
without having to pay the high cost of living in those locations. An increase in the 
cost of commuting restricts the opportunity set available to firms and workers and 
hence  reduces  welfare.  Locations  that  were  initially  net  exporters  of  commuters 
become less attractive residences, while locations that were initially net importers 
of  commuters  become  less  attractive  workplaces. As  agents  relocate  in  response 
to the restricted opportunity set, counties become less specialized as residential or 
business locations.
We begin by using the observed commuting data to back out implied values of the 
composite parameter capturing the ease of commuting (   ni   ≡  B ni    κ  ni  −ϵ  ). Following 
Head and Ries (2001) in the international trade literature, we use the flows of com-
muters between locations  n  and  i  in both directions relative to their own commuting 
flows. Using the commuting gravity equation (10), and taking the geometric mean 
of these relative flows in both directions, we obtain the following measure of the 
average ease of commuting between locations  n  and  i  relative to the ease of com-
muting to themselves:
(23) 

    ̃   ni   ≡   (    ni   _   nn         in   _   ii    )    

  =   (   L ni   _  L nn        L in   _  L ii    )

We compute this measure for both 1990 and 2010. Between these two years, both miles 
of paved roads and vehicle kilometers traveled increased substantially.41 Consistent 
with  this,  we  find  a  substantial  increase  in  the  relative  ease  of  commuting  from 

4 percent (     ̃   ˆ   ni   =  0.96 ) at the twenty-fifth percentile, to 12 percent (     ̃   ˆ   ni   =  0.88 )  
at the median, and 21 percent (     ̃   ˆ   ni   =  0.79 ) at the seventy-fifth percentile.

We use this distribution of implied changes in the relative ease of commuting to 
undertake counterfactuals for empirically-realistic changes in commuting costs. We 
assume a common reduction or increase in the costs of commuting for all counties 
equal to percentiles of this distribution (e.g., we assume that all counties experi-
ence a reduction in commuting costs equal to the median value of      ̃   ˆ   ni   ). Given this 
assumption, we use the system of equations for general equilibrium in the model 
to solve for the new counterfactual equilibrium after the reduction in commuting 
costs, as discussed in Section IF. Using the commuting probability (10), expected 
utility (15), the price index (8) and land market clearing (5), the change in the com-
mon level of welfare across all locations from the shock to commuting costs can be 
decomposed as follows:
(24) 
where we have used the fact that {  κ ii    ,   B ii    ,   A i    ,   d ii   } are unchanged; the first term in    λ ˆ   ii    
captures the impact through changes in openness to commuting; the second term 
in    π ˆ   ii    captures the effect through adjustments in openness to goods trade; the remain-
ing terms capture the influence of changes in the spatial distribution of wages (   w ˆ   i   ), 
expected residential income (   v –   i   ), employment (   L ˆ   i   ), and residents (   R ˆ   i   ).
As  shown  in  Table  5,  we  find  substantial  effects  of  these  empirically-relevant 
reductions  in  commuting  costs  on  aggregate  welfare.  Reducing  commuting  costs 
by  the  median  proportional  change  observed  over  our  time  period  from  1990  to 
2010 is predicted to increase welfare by around 3.3 percent (second column). In 
contrast, raising commuting costs by the same proportional amount decreases wel-
fare by around 2.3 percent. As we scale up the reduction in commuting costs to the 
 seventy-fifth percentile observed over our time period, we amplify the welfare gain 
to 6.9 percent (first column). As we scale down the reduction in commuting costs to 
the twenty-fifth percentile, we diminish the welfare gain to 0.89 percent (third col-
umn). These proportional changes in welfare are large relative to standard empirical 
estimates of the welfare gains from opening the closed economy to international 
trade, which for example range from less than 1 percent for the United States to 
just over 10 percent for Belgium in Eaton and Kortum (2002). One caveat is that 
we abstract from non-tradables different from housing or land, which may lead us 
to overestimate the welfare gain from reductions in commuting costs. Nonetheless, 

      (    w ˆ   i   __    v –  ˆ   i    )    

41 Between 1990 and 2010, kilometers of paved public roads in the United States increased by over 20 percent 
(from 3.6 to 4.4 million), and vehicle kilometers traveled increased by more than 38 percent (from 3,451,016 to 
4,775,352 million). For further discussion of this expansion in transport use, see for example Duranton and Turner 
(2011).

these results clearly highlight that commuting not only shapes the local impact of 
shocks but can be consequential for aggregate welfare.42

These empirically-realistic changes in commuting costs also result in substantial 
changes  in  the  spatial  distribution  of  employment  and  residents  across  locations. 
In online Appendix Figure C.9, we show the counterfactual change in employment 
in each county from reducing commuting costs by the median proportional change 
observed  over  our  time  period  from  1990  to  2010. We  find  a  strong  relationship 
between these counterfactual changes and the initial ratio of employment to resi-
dents (  L i  / R i   ). As discussed in Section IIB and shown in online Appendix Section 
B.6,  this  initial  employment  to  residents  ratio (  L i  / R i   )  is  itself  hard  to  explain  in 
terms of standard empirical controls, such as land area, size, and housing supply 
elasticities, and hence cannot easily be proxied by these variables.

In online Appendix Section C.11, we provide further evidence that the importance 
of commuting is by no means restricted to large cities. We undertake counterfactu-
als for reductions in commuting costs for CZs rather than counties (replicating our 
entire quantitative analysis for CZs). We show that the counterfactual changes in CZ 
employment from reductions in commuting costs are well explained by measures of 
the extent to which the CZ uses the commuting technology in the initial equilibrium. 
In contrast, these counterfactual changes in CZ employment are not well explained 
by initial CZ employment or residents size, confirming the importance of measures 
of commuting linkages.

Given  this  importance  of  commuting  links  in  shaping  the  distribution  of  eco-
nomic activity across locations, it is natural to expect that these links also determine 
the magnitude of the impact of reductions in trade costs. In online Appendix Section 
C.10,  we  explore  this  interaction  between  trade  and  commuting  costs.  We  com-
pare the counterfactual effects of a 20 percent reduction of trade costs in the actual 
world with commuting to the effects in a hypothetical world without commuting. 
In general, reductions in trade costs lead to a more dispersed spatial distribution of 
economic activity in the model. But this dispersal is smaller with commuting than 

42 Smaller (larger) values for the Fréchet shape parameter ( ϵ ) imply more (less) heterogeneity in preferences 
for residence-workplace pairs, which magnifies (diminishes) the effects of changes in commuting costs on welfare. 
For example, in a world with a 50 percent lower (higher) value of ϵ , reducing commuting costs by the median 
proportional change increases welfare by 6.9 (2.1) percent, while increasing commuting costs by the same amount 
reduces welfare by 4.8 (1.5) percent.

without commuting. As trade costs fall, commuting increases the ability of the most 
productive locations to serve the national market by drawing workers from a subur-
ban hinterland, without bidding up land prices as much as would otherwise occur. 
These results further underscore the prominence of commuting linkages in shaping 
the equilibrium spatial distribution of economic activity, and the necessity of incor-
porating them in models of economic geography.

VI.  Conclusions

The economic effects of local labor demand shocks have been the subject of an 
extensive empirical literature, which has considered a wide range of such shocks, 
including industry composition, international trade, macro and financial crises, and 
natural resource discoveries, among others. To understand the impact of these types 
of shocks, we develop a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model that incor-
porates spatial linkages between locations in both goods markets (trade) and fac-
tor markets (commuting and migration). Although we allow for a large number of 
locations and a rich geography in both goods and factor markets, our framework 
remains amenable to both analytical and quantitative analysis. We show how the 
model can be quantified using available data to match the observed gravity equation 
 relationships for trade in goods and commuting, as well as the observed cross-sec-
tion distributions of employment, residents and wages. Thus, our framework pro-
vides a tractable platform for undertaking a range of counterfactuals for realistic 
changes in trade and commuting costs.
While  previous  research  has  often  worked  at  relatively  high  levels  of  spatial 
aggregation (e.g., commuting zones) to reduce the effect of unmodeled commuting 
links, we explicitly model the spatial interactions between locations in goods and 
commuting markets, thereby providing a framework for examining the local impact 
of labor demand shocks at finer spatial scales within commuting zones. Commuting 
allows  workers  to  separate  their  workplace  and  residence,  thereby  introducing  a 
quantitatively relevant distinction between the effects of local labor demand shocks 
on employment and residents. We find substantial heterogeneity across both coun-
ties and CZs in the elasticity of local employment to a productivity shock, which 
ranges from around 0.5 to 2.5. Therefore an average local employment elasticity 
estimated in one context can be quite misleading if applied in another context with-
out  controlling  for  this  heterogeneity. We  show  that  this  heterogeneity  is  hard  to 
explain with standard empirical controls, such as area and size, but is well explained 
by measures of linkages in commuting networks. We use our model to highlight a 
summary statistic of the share of residents that work locally that can be included in 
reduced-form regressions to help to control for this heterogeneity.

We provide separate empirical evidence independent of our model for the impor-
tance  of  commuting  in  determining  the  employment  response  to  changes  in  the 
local economic environment. Using quasi-experimental evidence from million dol-
lar  plants (MDPs),  we  find  larger  increases  in  employment  in  response  to  labor 
demand  shocks  in  counties  with  more  open  commuting  markets,  consistent  with 
the predictions of our model. Finally, as well as shaping the effects of local labor 
demand shocks, we show that commuting also matters in the aggregate for the  spatial 
 distribution of economic activity and welfare. We use observed commuting flows 

MONTE ET AL.: COMMUTING, MIGRATION, AND EMPLOYMENTVOL. 108 NO. 123888

between pairs of counties over time to back out the empirical distribution of implied 
reductions in commuting costs from 1990–2010. Reducing commuting costs for all 
counties by the median of this empirical distribution, we find an increase in welfare 
of 3.3 percent, and employment changes across counties that range from increases 
of 28 percent to reductions of 19 percent. Taken together, our findings are consistent 
with the view that the openness of labor markets to commuting is central to shaping 
both the local response to shocks and the aggregate spatial distribution of economic 
activity across locations.
