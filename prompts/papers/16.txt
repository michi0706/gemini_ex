This article studies the effect of cash windfalls on the acquisition policy of companies. As 
identiﬁcation, I use a German tax reform that permitted ﬁrms to sell their equity stakes tax 
free. Companies that could realize a cash windfall by selling equity stakes see an increase 
in the probability of acquiring another company by 14%. I ﬁnd that these additional acqui- 
sitions destroy ﬁrm value. Following the tax reform, affected ﬁrms experience a decrease 
of 1.2 percentage points in acquisition announcement returns. These effects are stronger 
for larger cash windfalls. My ﬁndings are consistent with the free cash ﬂow theory.

1. Introduction 

How  access  to  ﬁnancing  affects  a  ﬁrm’s  investment 
policy  is  one  of  the  fundamental  questions  in  corporate 
ﬁnance.  As  Stein  (2003)  points  out,  there  is  convincing 
evidence  that  ﬁrms  with  a  strong  ﬁnancial  position  in- 
vest  more,  but  it  is  less  clear  whether  this  effect  is 
driven by under- or overinvestment. Underinvestment oc- 
curs if ﬁnancial frictions prevent management from mak- 
ing value increasing investments (e.g., Myers and Majluf, 
1984 ),  while  overinvestment  occurs  if  managers  engage 
in “empire building” ( Baumol, 1959; Williamson, 1964 ) as 
predicted by the free cash ﬂow theory ( Jensen, 1986 ). An-

swering this question is diﬃcult for two reasons: First, it is 
generally hard to determine whether an investment project 
creates value to shareholders. Second, internal ﬁnancial re- 
sources and investment opportunities are typically corre- 
lated, making any simple cross-sectional study subject to 
1 
endogeneity concerns. 

In  this  paper,  I  address  these  issues  by  studying  the 
effect  of  large  exogenous  cash  windfalls  on  a  ﬁrm’s  ac- 
quisition activity. The cash windfalls resulted from a Ger- 
man tax reform that made divestitures of equity stakes tax 
free. Since not all ﬁrms owned equity stakes, the tax re- 
form provided cash windfalls only to a subset of ﬁrms. Us- 
ing difference-in-difference estimation, I ﬁnd that ﬁrms re- 
ceiving  a  cash  windfall  undertake  more  acquisitions  and 
that  the  additional  acquisitions  have  negative  announce- 
ment returns, consistent with overinvestment. 

In addition to showing evidence of overinvestment, my 
paper  adds  to  the  literature  on  asset  sales.  Despite  the

ings  of  investment  cash  ﬂow  regressions  ( Fazzari,  Hubbard,  and  Pe- 
tersen,  20 0 0;  Kaplan  and  Zingales,  1997,20 0 0;  Erickson  and  Whited, 
20 0 0; Gomes, 2001; Alti, 2003; Moyen, 2004 ).

fact  that  U.S.  ﬁrms  raise  more  ﬁnancing  through  asset 
sales  than  through  equity  issuance  ( Edmans  and  Mann, 
2018 ), this ﬁnancing channel has received little attention 
in  the  academic  literature.  In  particular,  while  there  is 
evidence  that  asset  sales  are  correlated  with  higher  in- 
vestments  ( Hovakimian  and  Titman,  2006;  Borisova  and 
Brown, 2013 ), my paper is the ﬁrst to address endogeneity 
by exploiting an exogenous shock to ﬁrms’ ability to sell 
assets. 

This exogenous shock is provided by the German capi- 
tal gains tax reform in 20 0 0. Before the reform, many Ger- 
man corporations held minority equity stakes in unrelated 
ﬁrms. These equity stakes often had high market values, 
making up a sizeable part of the holder’s assets. For ex- 
ample, the telecommunications and energy company VIAG 
owned equity stakes with a (pre-tax) market value of EUR 
2.9  billion  (25%  of  its  own  market  capitalization)  at  the 
end of 1999. Many of these holdings had been established 
in the 1950s and 1960s and thus had accumulated large 
capital gains. Consequently, ﬁrms had strong incentives to 
maintain these equity stakes to avoid capital gains taxa- 
tion  ( Sautner  and  Villalonga,  2010 ).  The  German  govern- 
ment decided to abolish the 50% capital gains tax in 20 0 0, 
thus removing a major obstacle to the divestiture of the 
equity stakes. 

I  show  that  stock  prices  of  ﬁrms  with  large  equity 
stakes increased by 4% upon the announcement of the tax 
reform, which suggests that the reform was a surprise to 
the market and that the tax acted as a binding constraint 
on  ﬁrms.  After  the  tax  reform,  this  constraint  was  lifted 
and ﬁrms cashed in their equity stakes. I refer to the re- 
sulting cash inﬂows as windfalls, because the capital gains 
tax  effectively  prevented  a  sale  of  the  equity  stakes  be- 
fore  the  tax  reform  and  because  the  tax  reform  is  ex- 
ogenous to the investment opportunities of an individual 
ﬁrm. 

While  the  tax  reform  was  exogenous,  the  decision  to 
sell an equity stake is endogenous to the ﬁrm. Therefore, 
I conduct an intention-to-treat analysis and condition my 
analyses on the existence of an equity stake prior to the 
reform  rather  than  the  actual  divesting  decision,  i.e.,  my 
treatment group is ﬁrms with equity stakes in 1999 and 
the control group is ﬁrms without equity stakes. Such an 
intention-to-treat analysis is common in the literature (e.g., 
Angrist, 1990; Karlan and Zinman, 2010 ) and is the same as 
a  reduced-form  instrumental  variable  approach  in  which 
the divestiture of an equity stake is instrumented by the 
existence of an equity stake at the time of the tax reform. 
This approach is reasonable as 83% of companies divested 
at least one of their equity stakes following the tax reform 
and including the other 17% of ﬁrms in the analysis will 
only underestimate the true effect. 

Media  reports  suggest  that  ﬁrms  used  the  windfalls 
from selling equity stakes to undertake more acquisitions. 
For  example,  the  Wirtschafts  Woche ,  a  leading  German 
business magazine, wrote in February 2005: 

“The cross-holdings lock up capital which is needed to stay 
competitive internationally. The energy company E.ON sold 
several equity stakes […] as it needs the money for acqui- 
sitions abroad.”

2 
Wirtschafts Woche , February 4, 2005. 
My analyses suggest that E.ON is not the only ﬁrm to 
ﬁnance  acquisitions  by  divesting  equity  stakes.  A  simple 
comparison  of  means  reveals  that  the  yearly  probability 
of doing an acquisition increases by 14% (ﬁve percentage 
points)  for  ﬁrms  that  hold  equity  stakes  before  the  tax 
reform (and thus received a potential cash windfall), but 
decreases by 1.7 percentage points for the control group. 
A more elaborate difference-in-difference analysis conﬁrms 
these results by showing that ﬁrms with equity stakes in 
1999  increase  their  probability  of  undertaking  an  acqui- 
sition  by  eight  percentage  points  relative  to  the  control 
group. This ﬁnding rejects the perfect capital market as- 
sumption of Modigliani and Miller (1958) . 

Next,  I  study  the  acquirer  announcement  returns  to 
determine  whether  the  additional  acquisitions  represent 
overinvestment (free cash ﬂow theory) or a reduction in 
underinvestment (ﬁnancial constraints theory). I conduct a 
difference-in-difference analysis on the acquirer announce- 
ment returns. Companies that owned equity stakes at the 
time of the tax reform experience a decrease in average 
announcement returns relative to the control group of 1.2 
%. This ﬁnding is consistent with overinvestment. 

However,  because  average  announcement  returns  re- 
main positive after the tax reform, a concern is that the 
decrease in announcement returns can be explained by de- 
3 I address this 
creasing but still positive marginal returns. 
concern  in  two  ways:  First,  I  show  in  a  simple  calcula- 
tion  that  the  decrease  in  average  announcement  returns 
is so large that the additional acquisitions must have neg- 
ative  announcement  returns.  Second,  I  examine  the  sum 
of  the  announcement  returns  of  all  acquisitions  a  com- 
pany undertakes over a year (following Bertrand and Mul- 
lainathan, 2005 ). If the additional acquisitions have posi- 
tive announcement returns, they should increase the sum 
of announcement returns. However, after the tax reform, 
the  yearly  sum  of  all  announcement  returns  of  acquisi- 
tions completed by ﬁrms with cash windfalls decreases by 
0.4% relative to the control group. This result implies that 
the additional acquisitions destroy 0.4% of ﬁrm value per 
year or 3.2% over the sample period. These ﬁndings sug- 
gest that the cash windfalls are used for overinvestment as 
predicted by the free cash ﬂow theory. 

Next, I study for which ﬁrms the results are largest. We 
would expect the tax reform to have a stronger effect on 
ﬁrms receiving larger cash windfalls. Indeed, I ﬁnd that my 
results are largely driven by ﬁrms who rank above the me- 
dian by value of their equity stakes before the tax reform 
(as a share of their market capitalization). These ﬁrms see 
an  increase  in  acquisition  probability  of  10%,  while  it  is 
only  6%  for  ﬁrms  below  the  median.  Also  the  reduction

3 Like other studies on acquisitions in Europe ( Faccio, McConnell, and 
Stolin, 2006; Huyghebaert and Luypaert, 2009 ), I ﬁnd positive acquirer 
announcement returns. Even in the U.S. the average acquisition has a 
positive announcement return for acquirers, but large acquisitions with 
negative returns make the volume-weighted acquisition return negative 
( Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz, 2005 ).

in average announcement returns is larger for ﬁrms with 
large equity stakes (1.9% vs. 0.9%). 

Consistent with divestitures of equity stakes providing 
ﬁrms with additional cash, I ﬁnd that the results are con- 
centrated in acquisitions that are paid in cash. While the 
probability of undertaking a cash acquisition increases by 
9% for ﬁrms with equity stakes in 1999, the probability of 
undertaking a stock acquisition decreases slightly for these 
ﬁrms. Similarly, the decrease in acquisition announcement 
returns is concentrated in acquisitions paid for in cash. 

Finally, I show that the results are more prominent for 
ﬁrms  that  sold  more  equity  stakes  and  that  sold  equity 
stakes with higher market values. Furthermore, I show that 
acquisition  activity  increases  and  announcement  returns 
decrease  in  the  year  following  the  ﬁrst  divestiture  of  an 
equity stake. 

All results are robust to controlling for different trends 
in ﬁrm characteristics such as size, leverage, or Tobin’s Q , 
as well as industry-year ﬁxed effects. They are also robust 
to running the regressions on a control sample matched by 
size and industry as well as using a shorter event window. 
As expected, I do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant results when running 
a placebo test in which I pretend the tax reform happened 
in 1995. 

Additional acquisitions do not substitute for capital ex- 
penditures. In addition to the increase in acquisition activ- 
ity, ﬁrms receiving cash windfalls increase capital expendi- 
tures as a share of assets by 0.7 percentage points. While 
this result is not statistically signiﬁcant, it constitutes an 
increase of 13% relative to the sample median. In contrast, 
dividends are not increased by ﬁrms receiving cash wind- 
falls. 

Taken  together,  my  results  suggest  that  ﬁrms  do  not 
pay out the cash windfall to shareholders, but rather in- 
vest it in value-destroying acquisitions. Therefore, my re- 
sults are consistent with the free cash ﬂow theory and em- 
pire building of managers. 

My paper has important policy implications. It shows 
that the tax reform succeeded in allowing ﬁrms to divest 
their equity stakes and in freeing up capital for additional 
investments. However, my results also suggest that these 
investments  constituted  overinvestment,  which  destroyed 
shareholder value. 

My paper is related to two streams of literature: the lit- 
4 
erature on investment and the literature on asset sales. 
The investment literature started by studying the relation 
between investment and cash ﬂows directly (e.g., Fazzari 
et  al.,  1988;  Hoshi  et  al.,  1990;  Whited,  1992;  Almeida 
and Campello, 2007 ). Several studies also focus on acqui- 
sitions  and  investment  projects:  Lang  et  al.  (1991)  show 
that  low  q  ﬁrms  with  high  cash  ﬂows  exhibit  lower  ac- 
quirer  announcement  returns.  Harford  (1999)  shows  that 

4 My paper also relates to another stream of literature studying the 
marginal value of cash in a company ( Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson, 
2006;  Faulkender  and  Wang,  2006;  Dittmar  and  Mahrt-Smith,  2007; 
Frésard and Salva, 2010 ) and how companies accumulate and use cash 
reserves ( Opler et al., 1999; Dittmar, Mahrt-Smith, and Servaes, 2003; 
Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach, 2004; Harford, Mansi, and Maxwell, 
2008; Bates, Kahle, and Stulz, 2009; Denis and Sibilkov, 2010 ). I add to 
these papers by studying the effect of cash windfalls, which are exoge- 
nous to investment opportunities. 

ﬁrms with excess cash undertake more acquisitions, which 
are less proﬁtable. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2005) ﬁnd 
that oil companies with higher cash ﬂows bid more for oil 
and gas leases, but do not bid on more leases. However, 
all these studies are to some degree subject to endogene- 
ity concerns: Firms potentially hoard cash in anticipation 
of future acquisitions and cash ﬂows are correlated with 
investment opportunities. 

Therefore,  more  recent  papers  focus  on  shocks  to  ﬁ- 
nancial resources that are exogenous to the company’s in- 
vestment opportunities: Rauh (2006) uses the nonlineari- 
ties of mandatory pension contributions to show that ex- 
ogenous cash outﬂows cause a decrease in capital expen- 
5  However, Bakke and 
ditures, acquisitions, and dividends. 
Whited  (2012)  show  that  the  methodology  employed  in 
Rauh  (2006)  is  not  suﬃcient  to  account  for  the  endo- 
geneity  of  mandatory  pension  contributions.  Using  a  re- 
ﬁned approach, they ﬁnd no causal effect on investments. 
Other papers study shocks transmitted through the ﬁnanc- 
ing channel (e.g., Gan, 2007; Chaney et al., 2012; Almeida 
et al., 2012; Chava and Purnanandam, 2011 ). I make two 
important contributions to this literature. First, I use cash 
windfalls rather than cash outﬂows. This difference is im- 
portant: If shareholders want to restrict the free cash in 
the company, they ﬁnance it just suﬃciently to undertake 
all proﬁtable projects. In this case, the negative effect of 
an unexpected cash outﬂow on investment does not nec- 
essarily  imply  a  positive  effect  of  a  cash  windfall.  Sec- 
ond, I focus on acquisitions, which allows me to examine 
the value effect of the additional investments through an- 
nouncement returns. Thus, I can distinguish between the 
free cash ﬂow theory and non-agency theories of ﬁnancial 
constraints. Few papers look at cash windfalls. Blanchard 
et al. (1994) study cash windfalls of won or settled law- 
suits,  but  cannot  make  any  statistical  inference  because 
their study only includes 11 companies. Faulkender and Pe- 
tersen (2012) ﬁnd that constrained ﬁrms invest more af- 
ter a tax holiday on repatriated foreign earnings. However, 
the law granting the tax holiday included regulations forc- 
ing  ﬁrms  to  invest  the  repatriated  earnings ( Dharmapala 
et al., 2011 ). Thus, it is not clear whether their ﬁndings ex- 
tend to cash windfalls more generally or were just a result 
of the speciﬁc law. More generally, Dobridge (2016) ﬁnds 
that ﬁrms spend tax refunds differently depending on the 
macroeconomic environment. 

Second, I add to the literature studying asset sales as 
a  ﬁnancing  channel.  This  literature  is  surprisingly  small, 
given  that  U.S.  ﬁrms  raise  more  ﬁnancing  through  asset 
sales  than  through  equity  issuance  ( Edmans  and  Mann, 
2018 ). The literature include Bates (2005) , who ﬁnds that 
ﬁrms with better investment opportunities are more likely 
to  retain  the  proceeds  of  assets  sales.  Furthermore,  ﬁ- 
nancially constrained ﬁrms have a stronger sensitivity be- 
tween  the  proceeds  of  asset  sales  and  both  investment 
( Hovakimian and Titman, 2006 ) and research and develop- 

5 Following the approach in Rauh (2006) , Franzoni (2009) estimates the 
stock price reaction to mandatory pension contributions and Campbell, 
Dhaliwal, and Schwartz (2012) study their effect on companies’ cost of 
capital.

papers do not address the fact that asset sales are endoge- 
nous ﬁrm decisions. I add to this literature by studying an 
exogenous shock to a ﬁrm’s ability to sell a particular type 
of asset (equity stakes), which provides for better identiﬁ- 
cation. 

2. The German tax reduction act of 20 0 0 – description 
and event study 

My main source of identiﬁcation is the German Tax Re- 
duction  Act  of  20 0 0,  which  exempted  the  sale  of  equity 
stakes from corporate capital gains tax. Before the reform, 
many  German  companies  held  minority  equity  stakes  in 
other unrelated companies. Also, cross-holdings, in which 
company A holds equity in company B while company B 
holds equity in company A, were not uncommon. This sys- 
tem of minority equity stakes and cross-holdings was of- 
ten called Germany Inc. (Deutschland AG). Many of these 
equity stakes had been acquired in the distant past; often 
after the Second World War as a way to foster coopera- 
tion in the German economy ( Edwards et al., 2004 ). Thus, 
the equity stakes had book values signiﬁcantly below their 
market values, implying large capital gains. 

In Appendix B , I provide some analyses to get an idea 
of the size of these capital gains. Five ﬁnancial companies 
with large equity holdings report the book and market val- 
ues of their holdings on their balance sheets. On average, 
for these ﬁve ﬁrms, the book value of the stakes makes up 
only 36% of the stakes’ market value. For other ﬁrms I do 
not have the exact book values, but I can infer from the 
highly positive stock returns in the years leading up to the 
tax reform that most equity stakes were likely held at high 
capital gains. For example, 76% of equity stakes had cumu- 
lative stock returns of over 50% in the ten years leading up 
to the tax reform (see Appendix B ). 

Before  the  tax  reform,  corporate  capital  gains  were 
taxed  at  50%,  which  implies  that  companies  would  have 
suffered a signiﬁcant tax burden if they had divested their 
7 The German 
equity stakes ( Sautner and Villalonga, 2010 ). 
government lifted this lock-in by exempting the sale of eq- 
uity stakes from capital gains taxes with the explicit in- 
tention to facilitate the breakup of Germany Inc. ( Höpner, 
20 0 0 ). This tax exemption was part of a wider tax reform, 
which included a reduction in individual and corporate tax 
rates as well as a change in dividend taxation. However, 
there is no reason to believe that the general tax changes 
had speciﬁc effects on ﬁrms with equity stakes. For a de- 
tailed description of the tax reform, see Keen (2002) . 

In Fig. 1 , I study how the announcement of the tax ex- 
emption affected the stock prices of companies holding eq- 
uity stakes. While the general tax reform was announced 

6 There is also a large literature that studies the announcement returns 
of asset sales and ﬁnds generally positive announcement returns (e.g., 
Alexander, Benson, and Kampmeyer, 1984; Jain, 1985; Klein, 1986; Hite, 
Owers, and Rogers, 1987; Lang, Poulsen, and Stulz, 1995; Borisova, John, 
and Salotti, 2013 ). 

7 Capital gains were taxed at 40% corporate tax and trade tax that 
varies across regions, but was approximately 10%. For more details see 
Edwards et al. (2004) . 

on December 21, 1999, the plan for the corporate capital 
gains tax exemption was not conﬁrmed until December 23, 
1999. In Panel A, I plot the average returns for companies 
with and without minority equity stakes around these an- 
nouncement dates. While there was no reaction to the an- 
nouncement of the general tax reform, the announcement 
to exempt equity sales from corporate capital gains taxes 
had a large market impact. During a quiet stock market en- 
vironment, companies with equity stakes experienced an 
average  stock  return  of  2.2%  on  the  announcement  date, 
while the return for companies without equity stakes was 
only 0.2%. The difference in the average returns between 
the two groups was larger than on any other day in the 
year around the announcement date. 

In Panel B, I focus on ﬁrms holding large equity stakes, 
i.e., ﬁrms whose equity stakes made up at least 1% of their 
market value. I display the return difference between these 
ﬁrms and ﬁrms without equity stakes. Firms with large eq- 
uity stakes experienced an excess return of 4.0%, by far the 
highest in the entire year around the event. These ﬁndings 
are  consistent  with  the  results  of  Edwards  et  al.  (2004) , 
who show a positive stock price reaction to the announce- 
ment  of  the  tax  reform  concentrated  in  the  six  largest 
holders. 

In Panel C, I split companies with large equity stakes 
into whether they are ﬁnancial or nonﬁnancial companies. 
Given  that  banks  held  the  largest  equity  stakes,  I  exam- 
ine whether the results are driven exclusively by ﬁnancial 
companies. While ﬁnancial companies indeed have a larger 
announcement return of 5.1%, nonﬁnancial companies with 
large equity holdings also had a return of 2.4%, which is 
signiﬁcant at the 5% level. 

The event study shows that the corporate capital gains 
tax  indeed  constrained  ﬁrms’  ability  to  sell  their  equity 
stakes and that its abolition was not expected by the mar- 
ket.  This  idea  is  supported  by  the  fact  that  Handelsblatt , 
Germany’s leading business newspaper, headlined on the 
following day, “Eichel [the ﬁnance minister] surprises stock

is important, because it alleviates worries that acquisition 
decisions before 1999 are endogenous to the anticipation 
of the tax reform. 

The German parliament passed the general tax reform 
in  the  summer  of  20 0 0  to  be  effective  from  January  1, 
2001. The abolition of the capital gains tax did not come 
into effect until January 1, 2002. However, there were ways 
for companies to divest equity stakes before 2002 and still 
capture  the  better  tax  treatment.  For  example,  Deutsche 
Bank sold a stake in Allianz on June 6, 20 0 0 and stated 
in its investor relations release: 

“The economic disposal has been achieved by an innova- 
tive structure which allows Deutsche Bank to obtain the 
full  beneﬁts  from  the  upcoming  tax  reform  in  Germany. 
The transaction will qualify as a disposal for the Deutsche 
Bank  Group  in  its  IAS  accounts,  giving  rise  to  a  capital

gain in excess of EUR 2 billion, but without triggering a 
9 
tax disposal in the current year”. 

Furthermore,  anticipating  the  tax  reform,  companies 
could have chosen to reduce their cash buffer and thereby 
use the additional ﬁnancial resources already before they 
actually sold any equity stakes. Accordingly, I use the an- 
nouncement of the tax reform in December 1999 as the 
event date. 

On the other hand, when the tax reform took effect in 
2002,  stock prices in Germany  had experienced a recent 
bear  market  and  ﬁrms  could  have  been  reluctant  to  sell 
their equity stakes quickly. Therefore, I examine a relatively 
long post-event period until 2007. To make the event win- 
dow symmetric, I use 1992–1999 as the pre-event period. 
However, I show in Table 12 that the results are robust to 
a shorter event window. 

I am not the ﬁrst to use the German capital gains tax 
as  a  natural  experiment.  As  mentioned  above,  Edwards 
et al. (2004) study the stock market reaction to the tax re- 
form. Weber (2009) studies the change of ownership con- 
centration after the tax reform and ﬁnds that ownership 
concentration  has  been  reduced.  This  ﬁnding  is  consis- 
tent with ﬁrms selling their equity stakes in other compa- 
nies. Sautner and Villalonga (2010) use the tax reform as 
an exogenous shock to ﬁrms’ ownership structures. They 
ﬁnd  that  ﬁrms  whose ownership concentration  increases 
reduce diversiﬁcation and exhibit an increase in the eﬃ- 
ciency of internal capital markets. Von Beschwitz and Foos 
(2014) study how the divestiture of bank’s equity stakes af- 
ter the tax reform affects the lending relationship. 

3. Data and variable construction 

3.1. Sample construction 

The  data  used  in  this  study  come  from  ﬁve  different 
databases. I obtain ownership data from Who owns Whom? 
(Wer  gehört  zu  wem?)  provided  by  Picoware  as  of  July 
1999. This database contains roughly 18,0 0 0 private as well 
as  publicly  traded  ﬁrms  and  their  owners.  The  data  are 
based  on  public  sources  such  as  balance  sheets  and  ad- 
ditional  self-reported  information  by  companies.  I  obtain 
data on acquisitions from Thomson Reuter’s Securities Data 
Company (SDC) Platinum. For acquisitions with missing in- 
formation on payment method, I add this information from 
Zephyr database on acquisitions. I use Worldscope for bal- 
ance sheet data and Datastream for stock market data. In 
addition, I use balance sheet and stock market data from 
Compustat  Global  if  observations  are  missing  in  World- 
scope or Datastream. 

I  limit  my  sample  to  publicly  listed  companies  to  be 
able  to  compute  announcement  returns.  I  deﬁne  Equity 
stake 1999 as an indicator variable equal to one if the ﬁrm 
owns  a  minority  equity  stake  in  another  (public  or  pri- 

9 "Deutsche  Bank  reduces  Allianz  stake  to  4.1%"  ( https://www.db. 
com/ir/en/content/ir _ releases _ 20 0 0 _ 3464.htm )  and  "Deutsche  plays 
clever  in  Allianz  sale  to  avoid  CGT"  ( http://www.eﬁnancialnews.com/

vate) company before the tax reform. I include direct own- 
ership as well as indirect ownership through subsidiaries 
(see  Appendix  C  for  more  details).  Following  Edwards 
et al. (2004) , I deﬁne a minority equity stake to be any eq- 
uity stake in another company below 20%. Thus, I assume 
that  equity  stakes  below  20%  are  less  likely  to  generate 
economic beneﬁts and are more likely to be divested af- 
ter the tax reform. In my sample, there are 554 companies 
from the Who owns Whom? database that I can match to 
Worldscope or Compustat Global. Of these companies, 130 
companies (23.4%) own at least one equity stake. 

I study acquisitions of both public and private targets. 
However, to exclude the acquisition of subsidiaries as well 
as investments without economic control, I focus on acqui- 
sitions, in which the acquirer owns less than 25% of shares 
before the acquisition and more than 50% after the acqui- 
sition. If several acquisitions are announced on the same 
day, this day only enters the regressions once. Variable def- 
initions are in Appendix A . More detail on sample and vari- 
able construction is in Appendix C . 

3.2. Summary statistics 

In Fig. 2 , I display the companies in my sample by 10 
Fama–French industries. Companies with equity stakes in 
1999 cover all industries except oil & gas, but are some- 
what overrepresented in the utilities and ﬁnancial sectors, 
while  they  are  underrepresented  in  manufacturing,  non- 
durables,  and  business  equipment.  I  ensure  that  the  dif- 
ferent  industry  composition  is  not  driving  my  results  by 
controlling for industry-speciﬁc trends with industry-year 
ﬁxed effects (following Gormley and Matsa, 2014 ). Also, it 
should be noted that ﬁrms with equity stakes are not con- 
centrated  in  the  technology  sector,  which  alleviates  con- 
cerns that the results are driven by the burst of the Inter- 
net bubble. 

Panel A of Table 1 displays the summary statistics of 
companies  with  and  without  equity  stakes  in  1999  be- 
fore  the  tax  reform  (December  1999).  I  display  median 
and  mean  values  and  test  whether  the  difference  in  the 
two subsamples is statistically signiﬁcant. In terms of in- 
vestment  opportunities  measured  as  Tobin’s  Q ,  there  is 
no difference between companies with and without equity 
stakes. The ﬁrms in the two subsamples are also similar 
in terms of leverage, dividend ratio, and return on assets. 
The main difference is that companies with equity stakes 
are considerably larger as measured by market capitaliza- 
tion. I address this difference by including ﬁrm size inter- 
acted  with  the  post-reform  dummy  in  my  difference-in- 
difference setup. In addition, I run regressions on a sample 
matched by industry and ﬁrm size. 

Panel B displays more details on the subsample of ﬁrms 
with equity stakes in 1999. In this subsample, the median 
ﬁrm holds two equity stakes, but the mean is 4.9 as some 
ﬁrms  own  a  large  number  of  equity  stakes.  Next,  I  dis- 
play the (pre-tax) value of the equity stakes. Given that I 
include  equity  stakes  in  private  companies,  this  value  is 
only an estimate (see Appendix C for details of the esti- 
mation). The distribution of the value of equity stakes is 
highly skewed. The median company holds equity stakes 
worth EUR 7.4 million, while the mean is EUR 646 million.

Table 1 
Summary statistics. 
Panel A displays summary statistics of the sample, split by whether a company holds an equity stake in another company in 1999. Variables 
are taken as of the last ﬁscal year ending before December 31, 1999. The test for the difference in median is the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
The test for the difference in mean is the Student t -test. Dividends ratio is deﬁned as total dividends over total assets. Return on assets is 
deﬁned as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) over total assets. Panel B displays summary statistics on equity stakes for those ﬁrms 
that held at least one equity stake. Number of equity stakes gives the number of equity stakes a ﬁrm owns. Value of equity stakes (million 
EUR) is my estimate of the sum of their value. Value of equity stakes (in % of market cap) is this sum divided by the ﬁrm’s own market 
, 
value in percentage points. Panel C displays summary statistics on the acquisition level. Other variables are deﬁned in Appendix A .

Next,  I  compare  these  values  to  the  ﬁrm’s  own  marked 
capitalization. On average, the equity holdings account for 
24% of a ﬁrm’s market capitalization (median 0.73%). I use 
the fact of this skewed distribution by showing that my re- 
sults are stronger in the subsample with the largest equity 
holdings. 

Panel C displays summary statistics on the acquisition 
level. The average acquisition has a positive announcement 
return  of  0.57%  (median  0.23%).  Of  the  acquisitions,  34% 
are diversifying in the sense that the target is in another 
industry (using 10 Fama–French industries). Of the targets, 
58% are outside Germany, 55% are publicly listed, and 53% 
are  independent  ﬁrms,  while  47%  are  spinoffs.  SDC  Plat- 
inum and Zephyr only provide the payment information in 
27% of the cases, but for these cases, 89% of the acquisi- 
tions are paid in cash. To get an idea of the payment meth- 
ods for acquisitions without payment information, I run a 
predictive regression explained in Appendix D . I treat an 
acquisition without payment information as a cash acqui- 
sition if it has a probability of larger than 75% to be a cash 
acquisition according to that regression. After this adjust- 
ment, 95% of acquisitions are cash acquisitions. 

owners,  I  assume  that  the  owner  that  experienced  the 
largest  increase  in  ownership  bought  the  equity  stake.  I 
display  the  result  of  this  analysis  in  Panel  C.  About  32% 
of  equity  stakes  are  sold  to  listed  companies,  while  35% 
are sold to private companies, 20% are sold into free ﬂoat, 
and 6% are sold to the government sector, such as cities, 
states, or government-aﬃliated entities. The other 7% are 
sold to investor groups, individual investors, or the compa- 
nies themselves as buybacks. 

An implicit assumption in my analysis is that most eq- 
uity stakes were divested for cash rather than via a share 
exchange.  The  result  that  only  32%  of  equity  stakes  are 
sold to publicly listed companies suggests that this is the 
case because other types of buyers cannot offer share ex- 
changes. Furthermore, as shown in Section 3.2 , even pub- 
licly listed companies pay for a large fraction (95%) of their 
acquisitions in cash. In Appendix E , I show that the fraction 
of cash acquisitions is even higher when a company pur- 
chases an equity stake rather than a whole company. This 
evidence suggests that most equity stakes were indeed di- 
vested for cash, thus generating a cash windfall to the sell- 
ing ﬁrm. 

4. Results 

4.2. Acquisition probability 

4.1. Divestitures of equity stakes following the tax reform 

Several  prior  studies  ﬁnd  that  companies  divested  a 
large part of their equity stakes following the tax reform 
( Kengelbach and Roos, 2006; Höpner and Krempel, 2006 ). 
In  Table  2 ,  I  conﬁrm  this  result  for  my  data  set.  I  use 
Who owns Whom? data from November 2006 to determine 
which equity stakes have been divested. I check by hand 
that equity stakes have indeed been divested and not just 
moved  to  a  different  holding  vehicle.  For  the  stakes  for 
which I have data, 61.1% are divested by November 2006 
and 83% of companies sold at least one equity stake until 
November 2006. 

It  is  not  surprising  that  many  ﬁrms  sold  their  equity 
stakes  as  they  had  strong  incentives  to  do  so:  ﬁrst  and 
most importantly, if the company is unrelated, then hold- 
ing  an  equity  stake  in  it  will  not  create  value  and  the 
locked-in capital can be put to a more effective use. Sec- 
ond, companies realized large accounting gains by selling 
the equity stakes, which was an incentive to sell for man- 
agers, who cared about reporting a high accrual income. 
Third, there was a general election in Germany in Septem- 
ber  2002,  and  the  political  opposition  had  announced  a 
plan to reintroduce capital gains taxation. The opposition 
narrowly  lost  the  election  and  the  sale  of  equity  stakes 
is  tax  free  for  companies  to  this  day.  However,  in  2002, 
the opposition was ahead in the polls, which caused some 
companies to sell their equity stakes to front run a return 
of the tax.

Next,  I  use  Who  owns  Whom?  data  to  determine  the 
likely buyers of equity stakes. For those equity stakes that 
are conﬁrmed divestitures, I check which new owner re- 
places the old owner in the data. If there are several new 

10 “Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes", Spiegel, November 09, 2002 ( http: 

//www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-24793156.html ). 

In this section, I study how a company’s acquisition be- 
havior depends on its ﬁnancial resources using the German 
capital gains tax reform as identiﬁcation. The tax reform 
enabled ﬁrms to sell their equity stakes tax free. Thus, it 
provided  a  cash  windfall  only  for  companies  able  to  sell 
an equity stake. Accordingly, I compare how the acquisition 
behavior of companies with equity stakes in 1999 changes 
relative to companies without equity stakes. 

I  condition  my  analysis  only  on  ownership  of  equity 
stakes before the tax reform rather than divestiture of eq- 
uity stakes because the decision of whether or not to sell 
the  equity  stake  is  endogenous.  More  speciﬁcally,  I  con- 
duct an intention-to-treat analysis, which is essentially a 
reduced-form instrumental variable approach, in which the 
sale of an equity stake is instrumented with the existence 
of an equity stake prior to the tax reform. The intention- 
to-treat (ITT) effect measures the effect of being able to sell 
an equity stake. However, one might also be interested in 
the treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effect, i.e., the effect of 
actually selling equity stakes. 

Two  issues  make  it  diﬃcult  to  assess  the  TOT  effect: 
First, due to missing data, I do not know the exact frac- 
tion  of  ﬁrms  that  sold  equity  stakes  (but  I  know  that  it 
is  between  66%  and  87%).  Second,  the  tax  reform  could 
have had some effect on ﬁrms that did not sell their equity 
stakes.  For  example,  a  ﬁrm  could  reduce  its  cash  buffer 
when it knows that it can divest an equity stake, allow- 
ing it to use the cash windfall without actually divesting 
the equity stake. 

Thus, I cannot estimate the TOT effect precisely. How- 
ever, I can say that it is at least as high as the ITT effect (if 
the tax reform had the same effect on ﬁrms that did not 
sell their stakes) and at most 1.5 times as high (computed 
as 1/0.66, in the case in which only 66% of ﬁrms sold their 
equity  stakes  and  the  tax  reform  has  no  effect  on  ﬁrms 
that keep their equity stakes). In the rest of the paper, I

Divestitures of equity stakes until 2006. 

Panel A displays how many of the equity stakes were sold until November 2006. An eq- 
uity stake is deﬁned as sold if it has been divested by at least 50%. If the ﬁrm in which the 
stake is held is not covered anymore in Who owns Whom? , the equity stake is listed under 
not covered. In Panel B, I display how many companies sold at least one equity stake. In 
Panel C, I display the type of buyers of the equity stakes with conﬁrmed divestitures. The 
buyer is the entity that replaces the original owner of the equity stake in Who owns Whom? 
I manually check the Who owns Whom? data for mistakes and adjust it accordingly.

will report the ITT effects, which are a lower bound to the 
TOT effects. But the reader should keep in mind that the 
true TOT effects can be up to 50% higher. 

Under  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  ﬁnancial  constraints, 
a cash windfall should have no effect on the acquisition 
activity,  since  companies  without  a  cash  windfall  could 
simply raise the same amount of money in the ﬁnancial 
market. On the other hand, under both the ﬁnancial con- 
straints theory and the free cash ﬂow theory, a cash wind- 
fall should result in more acquisitions. This prediction im- 
plies that it is easier to raise ﬁnancing by selling equity 
stakes  than  by  issuing  equity  or  bonds.  This  assumption 
seems reasonable given that divestitures of equity stakes 
are less affected by asymmetric information ( Edmans and 
Mann, 2018 ). 

I  start  with  a  univariate  analysis  in  Fig.  3 .  I  examine 
the probability that a company undertakes an acquisition 
in a certain year calculated as the number of companies 
doing an acquisition divided by the total number of com- 
panies. After the tax reform, companies that owned an eq- 
uity  stake  in  1999  experience  an  increase  in  acquisition 
probability of ﬁve percentage points or 14% relative to the 
pre-event period. At the same time, the probability of un- 
dertaking an acquisition slightly decreases by 1.7 percent- 
age points for companies without equity stakes. These re- 

sults suggest that the additional ﬁnancial resources from 
selling  their  equity  stakes  led  companies  with  equity 
stakes  to  increase  their  acquisition  activity  after  the  tax 
reform. 

After  illustrating  the  overall  economic  effect  above,  I 
now undertake a more detailed analysis using a difference- 
in-difference setup:

effects absorb any time trends. For example, the tax reform 
could  make  acquisitions  more  attractive,  since  future  di- 
vestitures are not subject to capital gains taxation. How- 
ever,  this  effect  should  be  the  same  for  companies  with 
and  without  equity  stakes  and  thus  be  captured  by  the 
year  ﬁxed  effects.  The  fundamental  identifying  assump- 
tion of this analysis is that factors other than the capital

gains tax reform affect companies with and without equity 
stakes in the same way (parallel trends assumption). Since 
there might be different trends by industry, I add industry- 
year ﬁxed effects. I do not include time-varying controls 
as these can be endogenously affected by the tax reform. 
However, I add ﬁrm-speciﬁc controls (measured in 1999) 
interacted  with  the  post-reform  dummy.  This  method  to 
account  for  differing trends  depending on  industry  char- 
acteristics  and  control  variables  has  been  used  in  many

ber 1999. I cluster standard errors at the ﬁrm level, which 
controls  for  the  serial  correlation  issue  in  difference-in- 
difference analyses ( Bertrand et al., 2004 ). 

I  report  results  in  Table  3 .  The  dependent  variable 
is  a  dummy  variable  equal  to  one  if  a  company  under- 
takes  an  acquisition  in  a  certain  year.  I  follow  Harford 
(1999) and study the probability of undertaking an acquisi- 
tion in a given year rather than the number of acquisitions, 
since several small acquisitions could be equivalent to one 
large acquisition. Due to the incidental parameters prob- 
lem ( Chamberlain, 1980 ), I run logit estimation conditional 
on ﬁrms rather than logit with ﬁrm ﬁxed effects. In addi- 
tion, I also run a linear probability model estimated with 
ordinary least squares (OLS). 

In  all  speciﬁcations,  the  interaction  of  Equity  stake 
1999  and  Post  reform  has  a  positive  effect  on  the  acqui- 
sition probability. In nonlinear difference-in-difference se-

Fig. 4.  Effect of cash windfall on acquisition probability by year. This ﬁgure reports the point estimates from a logit regression conditional on ﬁrms of 
Acquisition dummy on the interaction between Equity stake 1999 and yearly dummies from 1994 to 2007. Additional controls in the regression include year 
ﬁxed effects as well as Size, Leverage , and Tobin’s Q in 1999 interacted with Post reform . The speciﬁcation is the same as that reported in Table 3 Regression 1, 
except that Equity stake 1999 is interacted with yearly dummies from 1994 to 2007 instead of Post reform . The two vertical lines indicate the announcement 
of the tax reform in December 1999 and the tax reform coming into effect in January 2002. See Appendix A for variable deﬁnitions. 

the additional cash from liquidating their equity stakes to 
engage in additional acquisitions. 

To  get  a  better  impression  of  the  exact  timing  of 
the increase in acquisitions, I follow Gormley and Matsa 
(2011) and plot the point estimates of a modiﬁed version 
of Regression 1 in Fig. 4 . In this modiﬁed regression setup, 
I  allow  the  effect  of  owning  an  equity  stake  in  1999  to 
vary by year from six years before to eight years after the 
announcement  of  the  tax  reform.  Before  the  tax  reform, 
there is no apparent trend in the difference between ﬁrms 
with  and  without  equity  stakes,  thus  validating  the  par- 
allel trends assumption. If anything, there seems to be a 
slight downwards trend in the relative acquisition proba- 
bility of ﬁrms with equity stakes. After the announcement 
of the tax reform in 1999, we see a reversal in the trend 
and an increase in the number of acquisitions for compa- 
nies with an equity stake in 1999. Especially, after the law 
comes into effect in January 2002 and companies can sell 
their equity stakes tax free, there is a large increase in the 
number of acquisitions of these companies, suggesting that 
the additional acquisitions were indeed caused by the cash 
windfalls following the reform. 

Overall, the results suggest that companies experiencing 
a cash windfall engage in more acquisitions. This ﬁnding is 
not consistent with the perfect capital market assumption 
of Modigliani and Miller (1958) . So far, these results do not 
tell us whether the additional acquisitions represent over- 
investment (free cash ﬂow theory) or a reduction in un- 
derinvestment (ﬁnancial constraints theory). I will address 
this question in the following section. 

4.3. Announcement returns 

After considering the number of acquisitions, I now ex- 
amine  whether  these  acquisitions  are  value  increasing.  I 

proxy  for  the  proﬁtability  of  the  acquisitions  using  an- 
nouncement returns. This approach assumes that the mar- 
ket  did  not  fully  anticipate  the  acquisition  decision  be- 
fore the announcement and thus the stock return around 
the announcement represents the change in ﬁrm value re- 
sulting from the acquisition. This assumption is standard 
to any analysis of acquisition announcement returns (e.g., 
Masulis et al., 2007; Moeller et al., 2005 ). 

+

−1  to  t 

I start with a univariate analysis in Fig. 5 . As is com- 
mon in the literature, I deﬁne Announcement return as the 
acquirer  return  in  the  three  trading  days  ( t 
  1) 
around the announcement date of the acquisition reported 
in  SDC  Platinum.  In  Panel  A,  I  focus  on  raw  returns.  I 
study one-factor alphas in Panel B and four-factor alphas 
in Panel C. I use factors speciﬁcally constructed for the Ger- 
man market (see Appendix C ). After the tax reform, com- 
panies with an equity stake in 1999 experience a decrease 
in the average acquisition announcement return by 0.5%. 
This ﬁnding suggests a reduction in average announcement 
returns for companies that received a cash windfall. Next, I 
study whether this result transfers to a more rigorous anal- 
ysis. 

Table 4 reports the results of a difference-in-difference 
speciﬁcation examining the change in acquirer announce- 
ment returns before and after January 1, 20 0 0. The unit of 
observation is an acquisition. As above, I control for size,

dummy as well as ﬁrm and industry-year ﬁxed effects. I

There are advantages and disadvantages to controlling 
for merger characteristics such as payment methods and 
the type of target. On the one hand, merger characteristics 
can clearly be endogenous to the cash windfall and thus

controlling for them could distort the analysis. For exam- 
ple, it is perceivable that ﬁrms receiving a cash windfall 
pay  more  in  cash  or  expand  more  abroad.  On  the  other 
hand,  merger  characteristics  have  been  clearly  related  to 
announcement  returns  and  it  is  standard  to  control  for 
them. Therefore, I report regression results with and with- 
out these controls. The regressions without merger-speciﬁc 
controls  show  the  total  effect  of  cash  windfalls  on  an- 
nouncement returns including the differences coming from 
different mer ger characteristics, while the other regression 
setup shows the effect conditional on these (endogenous) 
variables. 

The  merger  characteristics  that  I  control  for  include 
Cash acquisition, an indicator variable that is equal to one 
if the consideration listed in SDC Platinum is at least par- 
tially paid using cash, capital infusion, or debt reduction. 
Because the data item on considerations is often missing 
in SDC Platinum, I employ another indicator variable equal 
to one if I do not know the method of payment (in this 
case, Cash acquisition is set to zero). I also include dummy 
variables for diversifying acquisitions (different 10 Fama–
French industry of the target), cross-border deals, publicly 
listed targets, and targets which are independent compa- 
nies rather than spinoffs sold by another company. 

Robust to all these controls and ﬁxed effects, com panies 
that own equity stakes in 1999 experience a signiﬁcant de- 
crease in announcement returns after the tax reform. The 
effect is also economically signiﬁcant. Companies receiving 
a cash windfall experience a decrease in announcement re- 
turns by roughly 1.2%. For one- and four-factor announce- 
ment alphas, the effect is approximately 1%. Interestingly, 
controlling for the deal characteristics does not change the 
result. This ﬁnding suggests that the difference comes not 
so  much  from  acquiring  different  tar gets  as  from  select- 
ing worse targets and from overpaying, which is consistent 
with the free cash ﬂow theory. 

4.4. Interpretation of results 

The  results  indicate  a  clear  reduction  in  average  an- 
nouncement returns for ﬁrms with a cash windfall. How- 
ever, such a decrease does not necessarily mean that ﬁrm 
value is destroyed. Because average announcement returns 
of ﬁrms with cash windfalls remain positive after the tax 
reform (see Fig. 5 ), the decrease might be explained by de- 
creasing but still positive marginal returns to scale. To illus- 
trate this argument, consider an example with two acqui- 
sition opportunities with net present values (NPV) of two

and one. If the ﬁrm is ﬁnancially constrained and can take 
only one project, its average NPV is two. If it becomes un- 
constrained and takes both projects, the average NPV de- 
creases to 1.5. 

However, a simple calculation reveals that the decrease 
in  average  announcement  returns  from  0.65%  to  0.05% 
is  too  large  to  be  explained  by  decreasing  (but  posi- 
tive)  marginal  returns.  Even  assuming  all  additional  ac- 
quisitions  have  expected  announcement  returns  of  zero, 
the  number  of  acquisitions  would  have  to  increase  by 
1200%  to  drive  the  average  return  down  to  0.05%  (as 
+
(0.65 
 0.05). Yet, I observe an increase of only 
19%. Thus, the strong decrease in average announcement 
returns rejects non-agency theories of ﬁnancial constraints 
and supports the free cash ﬂow theory.

4.5. Yearly sum of announcement returns 

It  is  possible  to  conﬁrm  the  simple  calculation  above 
using  a  regression  framework.  For  this  purpose,  I  study 
the combined proﬁtability of all acquisitions of a company 
(following  Bertrand  and  Mullainathan,  2005 ).  Since  only 
positive net present value (NPV) projects are taken under 
the  ﬁnancial  constraints  theory,  every  additional  acquisi- 
tion  should  increase  the  sum  of  announcement  returns. 
Consider the above example with two acquisition oppor- 
tunities  with  NPVs  of  two  and  one.  If  the  ﬁrm  is  ﬁnan- 
cially constrained and can take only one project, its aver- 

age NPV is two and the sum of NPVs is two. If it becomes 
unconstrained, the average NPV decreases to 1.5 due to de- 
creasing marginal returns, but the sum of NPVs increases 
to three. However, under the free cash ﬂow theory, addi- 
tional investments are value destroying and will decrease 
the sum of announcement returns (see Table 5 for how dif- 
ferent outcome variables are affected under the different 
theories). 

Therefore,  I  estimate  difference-in-difference  regres- 
sions in which the dependent variable is the sum of the 
announcement returns of all acquisitions a company un- 
dertakes within a year. If the additional cash allows man- 
agers to engage in additional value-increasing acquisitions, 
I  expect  an  increase  in  the  Sum  of  announcement  re- 
turns , while I expect a decrease under the free cash ﬂow 
theory. 

Table 6 displays the results of this analysis. Companies 
that  receive  a  positive  cash  shock  see  a  decrease  in  ag- 
gregate  yearly  announcement  returns  of  0.4%.  In  Regres- 
sions  2  and  3,  I  show  that  the  effect  is  also  signiﬁcant 
for sums of one- and four-factor alphas at similar magni- 
tudes. These results imply that the additional acquisitions 
not only have lower, but actually negative announcement 
returns and therefore destroy value. The result is also eco- 
nomically signiﬁcant. It implies that approximately 0.4% of 
ﬁrm value is destroyed every year by additional acquisi- 
tions or worse execution of acquisitions. Over my sample 
period, this effect accumulates to 3.2%.

Table 7 
Differential effect by the size of the equity stakes. 

This table displays the main tests splitting the treated group by the aggregate size of their equity stakes. Large equity stake 1999 
is a dummy variable equal to one if the company ranks above the median by value of its equity stakes (as a share of its market 
capitalization) in 1999, while Small equity stake 1999 is a dummy variable equal to one if it ranks below the median. If a company 
does not own minority equity stakes, these two variables are set equal to zero. The main effects Large equity stake 1999, Small equity 
stake 1999, and Post reform are not included because they are multicollinear with the ﬁxed effects. Panel A displays regressions for the 
acquisition probability and is thus the counterpart to Table 3 . In Regression 1, I run a logit regression conditional on ﬁrm. In Regressions 
2 and 3, I run OLS regressions. Panel B displays regressions for announcement returns (in percentage points) and is thus the counterpart 
to Table 4 . Panel C displays regressions for the yearly sum of announcement returns (in percentage points) and is thus the counterpart 
to Table 6 . All variables are deﬁned in Appendix A . All standard errors are clustered at the ﬁrm level. I report t -statistics below the

4.6. Differential effect by the size of the cash windfall 

4.7. Differential effect by whether acquisitions are paid in 
cash or in stock 

Firms with larger equity stakes in terms of total mar- 
ket  capitalization  receive  a  larger  cash  windfall  from  di- 
vesting. Thus, we might expect a stronger effect for these 
ﬁrms. To test this idea, I repeat the analyses from Tables 
3 –6 , but split the treated group along the median in terms 
of  the  size  of  equity  stakes  as  a  fraction  of  the  holder’s 
market  capitalization.  I  introduce  two  new  dummy  vari- 
ables: Large equity stake 1999 is equal to one if the com- 
pany ranks above the median by aggregate value of equity 
holdings as a share of its market capitalization, while Small 
equity stake 1999 equals one if it ranks below the median. 
If a company has no equity stakes, both variables are set to 
zero. By including both of these variables (interacted with 
Post  reform )  in  the  regression,  I  estimate  the  effect  of  a 
large windfall and a small windfall both compared to the 
control group of ﬁrms without equity stakes. 

Table 7 shows the results. In Panel A, I repeat the anal- 
ysis  of  Table  3  on  acquisition  probability.  Firms  receiv- 
ing a large cash windfall see a 10% increase in acquisition 
probability, which is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level. 
On the other hand, ﬁrms with a small cash windfall see 
a  lower  increase  of  6%,  which  is  not  statistically  signiﬁ- 
cant. This ﬁnding suggests that a small cash windfall is not 
enough to trigger a signiﬁcant increase in the number of 
acquisitions, but that a large cash windfall is. 

In Panel B, the dependent variables are announcement 
returns and announcement alphas thus mirroring the anal- 
yses of Table 4 . Firms receiving a large cash windfall see 
a  large  drop  in  average  announcement  returns  of  about 
2% that is signiﬁcant at the 1% level. On the other hand, 
ﬁrms with a small cash windfall see a lower decrease of 
0.9%,  which  is  not  statistically  signiﬁcant.  The  result  for 
yearly sum of announcement returns (Panel C) is similar: 
a large cash windfall leads to a decrease in yearly sum of 
announcement returns of 0.6%, signiﬁcant at the 5% level, 
while a small cash windfall only leads to an insigniﬁcant 
decrease of approximately 0.2%. These ﬁndings show that 
the  effect  on  the  ﬁrms’  acquisition  behavior  depends  on 
the size of the cash windfall, which is consistent with the 
free cash ﬂow theory. 

We expect  the cash windfalls from the tax reform to 
have a stronger effect on acquisitions that are ﬁnanced by 
cash. I examine this proposition in Table 8 . Because pay- 
ment information is missing for such a large part of the 
sample,  I  supplement  the  payment  information  with  the 
information  obtained  from  the  predictive  regression  ex- 
plained in Appendix D . In Panel A, I run the same regres- 
sion as in Table 3 but instead of having Acquisition dummy 
as the dependent variable, I use two different dependent 
variables: Cash acquisition , which is equal to one if the ﬁrm 
undertakes a cash acquisition in the year and Stock acqui- 
sition , which is equal to one if the ﬁrm undertakes a stock 
acquisition. 

After the tax reform, ﬁrms with equity stakes in 1999 
experience an increase in the likelihood of undertaking a 
cash acquisition, but there is no increase in the effect of 
undertaking a stock acquisition. In fact, after controlling for 
industry-year  ﬁxed  effects,  I  ﬁnd  even  a  statistically  sig- 
niﬁcantly  negative  effect  on  the  probability  of  undertak- 
ing a stock acquisition. A negative effect can be possible if 
following the cash windfall, cash acquisitions “crowd out”
stock acquisitions, i.e., the ﬁrm decides to pay cash for ac- 
quisitions for which it would otherwise have used stock. 

∗

Next,  in  Panel  B,  I  split  the  effect  on  announcement 
returns  by  whether  the  acquisition  is  likely  paid  for  in 
cash  or  in  stock.  I  run  a  speciﬁcation  that  is  similar  to 
Table 4 in the paper, but instead of including Equity stake 
Post reform as the main explanatory variable of in- 
1999 
terest, I include Equity stake 1999 
Post reform interacted 
−Cash acquisi- 
with both Cash acquisition predicted and (1 
tion predicted) . This way, I split the main effect by whether 
it is a cash or a stock acquisition. While ﬁrms with equity 
stakes  in  1999  experience  a  1.2%  decrease  in  announce- 
ment returns for cash acquisitions, the decrease for stock 
acquisitions is only 0.4% and statistically insigniﬁcant. 

∗

To conclude, both the effect on acquisition probability 
and the result on announcement returns is mainly driven 
by cash acquisitions. This ﬁnding is consistent with the tax 
reform  providing  ﬁrms  with  equity  stakes  in  1999  with

Table 8 
Comparing effect of windfalls on cash and stock acquisitions. 

This table displays OLS panel regressions examining whether the tax windfalls from the tax reform had different effects on cash and 
stock acquisitions. In Panel A, the dependent variables are Cash acquisition dummy , which is a dummy variable equal to one if the ﬁrm 
undertook an acquisition ﬁnanced at least partly by cash or had a 75% probability of being paid in cash according to the predictive 
regression in Appendix D and Stock acquisition dummy , which is a dummy variable equal to one if the ﬁrm undertook an acquisition 
ﬁnanced solely by equity or having a below 75% probability of being paid in cash. The main explanatory variable of interest is the 
−1 
interaction between Equity stake 1999 and Post reform . In Panel B, the dependent variable is the cumulative acquirer return from t 
+
 1 around the announcement date. The explanatory variables of interest are the triple interactions of Equity stake 1999, Post 
to t 
−Cash acquisition predicted). Cash acquisition predicted is a dummy variable equal to 
reform, and either Cash acquisition predicted or (1 
one if the acquisition was paid in cash or if there is at least a 75% probability that the acquisition was paid in cash according to the 
predictive regression in Appendix D . All other variables are as deﬁned in Appendix A . The main effects are not included because they 
are multicollinear with the ﬁxed effects. All standard errors are clustered at the ﬁrm level. I report t -statistics below the coeﬃcients in

Fig. 6.  Effect split by number of divestitures. This ﬁgure reports the point estimates from a panel regression of Acquisition dummy (Panel A) and Sum of 
four-factor announcement alphas (Panel B) on the interaction between Post reform and indicator variables indicating the number of divestitures. I employ 
four indicator variables for one to two, three to four, ﬁve to ten, and more than ten divestitures. I also show the baseline of no divestitures as a comparison. 
In Panel A, the dependent variable is Acquisition dummy and I use a conditional logit model. Additional controls in the regression include ﬁrm and year 
ﬁxed effects as well as Size, Leverage , and Tobin’s Q in 1999 interacted with Post reform . The speciﬁcation is the same as that reported in Table 3 Regression 
1, except that Post reform is interacted with number of divestiture dummy variables instead of Equity stake 1999 . In Panel B, the dependent variable is Sum 
of four-factor announcement alphas and I use a basic OLS model. Additional controls in the regression include ﬁrm and year ﬁxed effects. The speciﬁcation 
is the same as that reported in Table 6 Regression 3, except that Post reform is interacted with number of divestiture dummy variables instead of Equity 
stake 1999 . See Appendix A for variable deﬁnitions. 

a  cash  windfall  that  they  use  to  undertake  more  value- 
destroying cash acquisitions. 

4.8. Differential effect by number and value of divestitures 

In this section, I study whether there are stronger re- 
sults for ﬁrms that sold more equity stakes. Using the Who 
owns Whom? data, I compute the number of equity stakes 
a ﬁrm sold as well as their value in EUR million. Thus, im- 
plicitly, I assume that equity stakes with missing data have 
not been sold. 

I start by examining the differential effect by number 
of  divestitures.  For  this  purpose,  I  assign  ﬁrms  into  four 
groups by whether they divested one to two, three to four, 
ﬁve to ten, or more than ten equity stakes. Then I run a 

regression similar to the standard difference-in-difference 
setup used in Table 3 , but instead of interacting Post reform 
with Equity stake 1999 , I interact it with four dummy vari- 
ables for these four groups indicating the number of di- 
vestitures. Fixed effects and control variables are the same 
as in the main regression. Then, I plot the coeﬃcients for 
the four quartiles as well as the base case of no divesti- 
tures (which also includes ﬁrms without equity stakes) in 
Fig. 6 . 

In Panel A, the dependent variable is Acquisition dummy , 
i.e.,  I  examine  the  change  in  acquisition  probability.  Af- 
ter the tax reform all ﬁrms with divestitures increased the 
number of acquisitions relative to the control group with- 
out divestitures and with one exception the increase in ac- 
quisition probability is monotonically increasing with the

four-factor announcement alphas (Panel B) on the interaction between Post reform and indicator variables indicating the quartile by value of divestitures. 
The value of divestitures is deﬁned as the EUR value of divestitures. I also show the baseline of no divestitures as a comparison. In Panel A, the dependent 
variable is Acquisition dummy and I use a conditional logit model. Additional controls in the regression include ﬁrm and year ﬁxed effects as well as Size, 
Leverage , and Tobin’s Q in 1999 interacted with Post reform . The speciﬁcation is the same as that reported in Table 3 Regression 1, except that Post reform is 
interacted with number of divestiture dummy variables instead of Equity stake 1999 . In Panel B, the dependent variable is Sum of four-factor announcement 
alphas and I use a basic OLS model. Additional controls in the regression include ﬁrm and year ﬁxed effects. The speciﬁcation is the same as that reported 
in Table 6 Regression 3, except that Post reform is interacted with number of divestiture dummy variables instead of Equity stake 1999 . See Appendix A for 
variable deﬁnitions. 

number  of  divestitures.  In  Panel  B,  I  ﬁnd  similar  results 
for announcement returns measured as Yearly sum of an- 
nouncement four-factor alphas . With the exception of one 
group, announcement returns are monotonically decreas- 
ing with the number of divestitures. 

Next, in Fig. 7 , I run the same speciﬁcations, but instead 
of splitting the sample by the number of divestitures, I split 
it into quartiles by the value of divestitures. After the tax 
reform, all ﬁrms with divestitures experience an increase 
in acquisition probability and a decrease in announcement 
returns relative to the control group without divestitures. 
While there is no monotonicity along the quartiles, the top 
quartile by divestitures experienced clearly the largest in- 
crease in acquisitions probability and the largest decrease 
in announcement returns. One would expect such a result 
concentrated  in  the  top  quartile  given  that  the  distribu- 

tion of divestiture values is highly positively skewed, i.e., 
the top quartile has signiﬁcantly more divestitures than the 
other three quartiles. 

These  results  are  consistent  with  a  larger  effect  on 
acquisition  activity  if  more  stakes  are  actually  divested, 
thereby supporting the previous ﬁndings in line with the 
free cash ﬂow theory. However, these results are only in- 
dicative,  because  they  are  affected  by  endogeneity  con- 
cerns as the decision to divest equity stakes is endogenous. 

4.9. Timing of effects relative to divestitures 

In  this  section,  I  study  the  timing  of  the  effects  on 
acquisition  activity  relative  to  the  divestitures  of  equity 
stakes. For this purpose, I examine a ﬁrm’s acquisition ac- 
tivity relative to its ﬁrst conﬁrmed divestiture of an equity

Fig. 8.  Effect of cash windfall on acquisition probability by year. This ﬁgure reports the point estimates from a panel regression of Acquisition dummy 
(Panel A) and Four-factor announcement alphas (Panel B) on indicator variables indicating the year relative to the year in which the ﬁrm ﬁrst divested an 
equity stake. Indicator variables are zero for ﬁrms without divestitures and years earlier than four years before the divestiture. Additional controls in the 
regression include ﬁrm and year ﬁxed effects as well as Size, Leverage , and Tobin’s Q in 1999 interacted with Post reform . In Panel A, the dependent variable 
is Acquisition dummy and I use a conditional logit model. In Panel B, the dependent variable is Four-factor announcement alphas and I use a basic OLS model. 
See Appendix A for variable deﬁnitions. 

stake. I deﬁne the year of divestiture as the ﬁrst year in 
which  the  equity  stake  does  not  appear  anymore  in  the 
Who owns Whom? database or in which it is reduced by 
at least 50%. 

I regress Acquisition dummy and Acquisition announce- 
ment returns on indicator variables indicating the year rel- 
−4 to 
ative to the ﬁrst divestiture of an equity stake from 
+
 4 years. For example, the variable “2” is equal to one in 
the second year after a divestiture and zero for all other 
years  and  for  ﬁrms  that  do  not  own  equity  stakes.  This 
setup is very similar to the one used in Fig. 4 , with the ex- 
ception that the indicator variables of interest are not de- 
ﬁned by calendar year but relative to the ﬁrst divestiture. I 
also include the usual ﬁxed effects and control variables. 

I  plot  the  coeﬃcients  of  the  indicator  variables  in 
Fig.  8 .  In  Panel  A,  the  dependent  variable  is  Acquisition 
dummy . As can be seen in the graph, the acquisition prob- 
ability is generally fairly constant, but clearly spikes in the 

ﬁrst  year  after  the  divestiture.  This  ﬁnding  is  consistent 
with ﬁrms using the cash windfall from the divestiture to 
engage in additional acquisitions in the following year. The 
fact that the increase in acquisition activity is only visible 
in the year following the divestiture (rather than the year 
of the divestiture) suggests a certain lead time to initiate 
additional acquisitions. 

Next, in Panel B, I run the same type of analysis but 
use Four-factor acquisition announcement alphas as the de- 
pendent variable. There is a large reduction in acquisition 
announcement returns of about 1% in both the year of the 
divestiture and the following year. This decline in acquisi- 
tion announcement return is consistent with the free cash 
ﬂow theory: ﬁrms use the cash windfall from the divesti- 
ture to overpay for acquisitions. 

Notice that for announcement returns I ﬁnd an effect 
already in the year of the divestiture, while I ﬁnd the ef- 
fect on acquisition probabilities only in the year after the

divestiture. This difference is consistent with the idea that 
it takes some time to initiate additional acquisitions after 
a cash windfall but that a ﬁrm can directly use the addi- 
tional cash to overpay for ongoing acquisitions that have 
already been initiated. 

The results on the timing are generally consistent with 
the idea that ﬁrms used the cash proceed from their di- 
vestiture of equity stakes to engage in value-destroying ac- 
quisitions. However, these results are only indicative, be- 
cause the decision when to divest an equity stake is en- 
dogenous. 

4.10. Capital expenditures 

One might be concerned that the increase in acquisi- 
tion activity is offset by a decrease in capital expenditures, 
i.e., that acquisitions act as a substitute for internal growth. 
Therefore, I now study how capital expenditures change for 
companies with equity stakes relative to companies with- 
out equity stakes after the tax reform. I run the same re- 
gression setup as in Table 3 , but using capital expenditures 
over assets as the dependent variable. 

My  sample  contains  both  ﬁnancial  and  nonﬁnancial 
companies. However, capital expenditures is an odd mea- 
sure  for  investments  of  ﬁnancial  companies.  Normally, 
the measure of choice for the expansion of banks is the 
amount  of  loans  issued.  On  the  other  hand,  high  capital 
expenditures are also a sign of expanding businesses (e.g., 
new oﬃces) or of consuming perquisites (e.g., more repre- 
sentative headquarters). Therefore, I run the regressions for 
the full sample as well as for the subsample of nonﬁnan- 
cial companies. 

Table 9 depicts the results of this analysis. On the full 
sample, there is a positive effect on capital expenditures of 
around 1% of assets. The effect is signiﬁcant at the 5% level. 

However,  if  I  exclude  ﬁnancial  companies  in  Regressions 
3 and 4, the effect is smaller and not statistically signiﬁ- 
cant anymore. However, it is still a sizeable 0.7% of assets, 
which represents an increase of 13% relative to the sample 
median. This ﬁnding suggests that ﬁrms with cash wind- 
falls increased their capital expenditures at least somewhat 
and certainly shows that acquisitions are not merely a re- 
placement for lower capital expenditures. 

4.11. Dividends 

In  perfect  capital  markets,  managers  that  maximize 
shareholder  value  should  pay  out  a  cash  windfall  to  the 
company’s shareholders. Therefore, I study how dividends 
as a fraction of assets changed following the tax reform. 
I use the same regression setup as above. The results are 
displayed in Table 10 . There is virtually no increase in div- 
idends, with all regression coeﬃcients being insigniﬁcant 
and around 0.1%. This result suggests that almost no part 
of the cash windfalls is paid out to shareholders via divi- 
dends, consistent with the free cash ﬂow theory. 

5. Robustness checks 

5.1. Matched sample 

The companies holding equity stakes in 1999 are larger 
than the sample average and not evenly distributed among 
industries.  As  a  further  step  to  address  concerns  about 
the violation of the parallel trends assumption, I rerun my 
main tests using a matched control-sample. For each com- 
pany with an equity stake in 1999, I select the company 
within the same 10 Fama–French industry that is closest by 
log market capitalization in 1999. I ensure that the same 
company does not enter the regression twice. If two com-

This table displays yearly panel regressions of dividends divided by total assets (in percentage 
points) on the interaction of Equity stake 1999 and Post reform . The main effects Equity stake 
1999 and Post reform are not included because they are multicollinear with the ﬁxed effects. 
In Regressions 3 and 4, I restrict the sample to nonﬁnancial companies (one-digit SIC code is 
different from 6). All variables are deﬁned in Appendix A . All standard errors are clustered

panies have the same best match, the second best match 
is chosen instead. 

Table 11 displays the results of this analysis. In Panel 
A,  I  re-estimate  the  effect  of  cash  windfalls  on  acquisi- 
tion activity. Using the matched sample I ﬁnd very sim- 
ilar  results  of  an  increase  in  acquisitions  probability  of 
8.2%  in  the  linear  probability  model.  Thus,  the  matched 
sample  analysis  suggests  that  the  baseline  regression  al- 
ready accounts well enough for differences in characteris- 
tics between ﬁrms with and without equity stakes in 1999. 
In  Panel  B,  I  re-estimate  the  effect  of  cash  windfalls  on 
the average announcement return. Here, the matching ap- 
proach actually increases the results to 1.5% (1.2% in terms 
of alpha), suggesting that the main regressions might un- 
derestimate the effect. In Panel C, I study the effect on the 
Sum of announcement returns , replicating regressions from 
Table 6 . I ﬁnd a negative effect of 0.4% (0.3% in terms of al- 
pha) which is of similar economic magnitude as the results 
in Table 6 . Overall, the matched sample approach yields re- 
sults consistent with the main regressions. For some speci- 
ﬁcations, the reported effects actually increase in economic 
magnitude, suggesting that the differences in industry and 
size composition in the treated and control samples do not 
cause the effects reported in the main speciﬁcation. 

5.2. Shorter sample period 

Throughout the paper, I use a relatively long sample pe- 
riod from 1992 to 2007 to account for a potential delayed 
reaction to the tax reform. A delayed reaction is likely, be- 
cause the tax reform, while announced in December 1999, 
did not take effect until 2002. At that time, the German 
stock market was experiencing a bear market, which might 
have led some ﬁrms to postpone the sale of equity stakes 
further. 

However, I show that the results are robust to using a 
shorter sample period from 1996 to 2005. Table 12 displays 
the results. For acquisition probability, the results are al- 
most identical. For announcement returns, they are close 
to  identical  in  terms  of  coeﬃcients,  but  are  not  statisti- 
cally signiﬁcant. For yearly sum of announcement returns 
the results are even larger over the shorter period (0.9% 
vs. 0.4%). This analysis suggests that the results are robust 
to using a shorter sample period. 

5.3. Controlling for reverse equity stakes 

When a ﬁrm sells an equity stake in another ﬁrm, there 
are two effects: the selling ﬁrm receives extra cash and the 
ﬁrm whose equity is sold experiences a change in its own- 
ership, which can affect its corporate governance. I focus 
on  the  ﬁrst  effect  in  this  paper,  while  the  effect  of  the 
ownership change is examined in Sautner and Villalonga 
(2010) . In this section, I address the concern that the own- 
ership effect could be driving the results as well. In gen- 
eral, it seems unlikely that ownership changes caused by 
the tax reform drive my results, because both the treated 
and the control groups should be affected. However, given 
that cross-holdings were relatively common in Germany, it 
is possible that ﬁrms owning equity stakes are also more 
likely to be owned via an equity stake. In this case, owner- 
ship changes could bias the results. 

To address this concern, I rerun the main analysis, but 
include  as  an  additional  control  the  variable  Reverse  eq- 
uity stake 1999 (interacted with Post reform ). Reverse equity 
stake 1999 is a dummy variable equal to one if at least one 
publicly  listed  German  ﬁrm  owns  an  equity  stake  below 
20% in the company in December 1999. Thus the deﬁni- 
tion is the same as for Equity stake 1999 , but in the oppo- 
site direction, i.e., it is equal to one if the ﬁrm is owned

via an equity stake rather than if it owns an equity stake. 
I base this variable on ownership of ﬁrms that are German 
and publicly listed for two reasons: ﬁrst, to ensure that it 
is the exact counterpart to Equity stake 1999 , and second, 
because the tax reform only applied to German ﬁrms, and 
private ﬁrms are likely to be holding companies of private 
owners, which are less likely to sell after the tax reform. 

The  results  of  this  robustness  check  are  presented  in 
Table  13 .  Including  the  new  control  variable  does  not 
change the results much. The result for acquisition prob- 
ability is actually larger, while the effect on announcement 
returns is unchanged. This ﬁnding conﬁrms that my results 
are indeed caused by the cash windfalls rather than being 
spuriously related to governance changes.

Placebo tax reform in December 1994. 

This table displays a placebo test for the main tests. I use 1990–1994 as the before event sample and 1995–1999 as the after event 
sample. Panel A displays regressions for the acquisition probability and is thus the counterpart to Table 3 . Panel B displays regressions 
for announcement returns (in percentage points) and is thus the counterpart to Table 4 . All variables are deﬁned in Appendix A . All

5.4. Placebo test 

In  difference-in-difference  analyses,  it  is  common  to 
conﬁrm  the  parallel  trends  assumption  using  a  placebo 
test. I conduct a placebo test by assuming the tax reform 
had taken place in December 1994. I use 1990–1994 as the 
pre-event period and 1995–1999 as the post-event period. 
I use the same classiﬁcations of a company owning an eq- 
uity  stake  as  above,  i.e.,  December  1999.  I  also  take  the 
control variables to be as of 1999 to have everything else 
besides the event timing comparable to my main analysis 
(the results do not materially change when I instead use 
control variables as of December 1994). 

The results are reported in Table 14 . First, I repeat the 
analysis  on  acquisition  probability.  As  one  would  expect, 
the  results  are  not  statistically  signiﬁcant  and  generally 
close to zero. Then, I repeat the analyses on announcement 
returns. Here, the results are insigniﬁcant as well and point 
into the opposite direction of the main speciﬁcation. Over- 
all, the placebo test conﬁrms that my results are not driven 
by mechanical relations or violations of the parallel trends 
assumption. 

high  market  values,  making  up  a  sizeable  part  of  the 
holder’s  assets.  The  capital  gains  tax  of  50%  prevented 
companies  from  selling  their  equity  stakes  even  if  there 
was no economic reason to hold on to them. The tax re- 
form completely abolished the capital gains tax, allowing 
companies  to  sell  their  stakes  and  cash  in  their  capital 
gains. 

Because  the  tax  reform  only  affected  com panies  that 
owned equity stakes, I can use difference-in-difference es- 
timation  to  examine  the  effect  of  this  cash  windfall  on 
ﬁrms’ acquisition and investment activity. I ﬁnd that com- 
panies  able  to  sell  an  equity  stake  after  the  tax  reform, 
engage  in  more  acquisitions  and  that  these  acquisitions 
are value destroying. The effects are stronger if the mar- 
ket value of the equity stakes and thus the cash windfall is 
larger. I also ﬁnd some increase in capital expenditures, but 
no effect on dividends. Overall, my results suggest that the 
cash windfalls which result from the divestitures of the eq- 
uity stakes of Germany Inc. were used to engage in empire 
building through  acquisitions.  This  behavior is  consistent 
with the free cash ﬂow theory and shows how the ability 
to engage in asset sales can affect investment. 

6. Conclusion 

Appendix A. Variable deﬁnitions 

In this paper, I study cash windfalls resulting from the 
German  capital  gains  tax  reform  in  20 0 0.  Before  the  re- 
form, many German companies held minority equity stakes 
in  other  unrelated  ﬁrms.  These  equity  stakes  often  had

Appendix B. Estimating capital gains of equity stakes 

Panel A displays market values and book values of eq- 
uity stakes as gathered from annual reports for the ﬁve ﬁ- 
nancial companies with the largest equity stakes. Descrip- 
tion of item gives the exact description from the annual re- 
port. Book to market is the book value divided by the mar- 
ket value in percent. My estimated market value is the ag- 
gregate market value of equity stakes in my sample that I 
estimate for these companies. Panel B displays returns of 

ﬁrms in which an equity stake was held up to December 
31, 1999 to get an idea of the likely capital gains at which 
stakes are held at the time of the tax reform. I display re- 
turns at three horizons: 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year in per- 
cent. I display means and medians of returns and which 
percent of stakes had positive returns and returns above 
15%, 25%, and 50%. The analysis is done at the equity stake 
level, i.e., if two ﬁrms hold an equity stake in a particular 
ﬁrm, this ﬁrm’s returns are included twice.

C.1. Ownership data 

I  start  constructing  my  sample  using  the  Who  owns 
Whom? (Wer gehört wem?) database on equity stakes in 
Germany  as  of  July  1999.  I  match  companies  from  Who 
owns Whom? to the other data sources using German secu- 
rity identiﬁers (Wertpapierkennnummern or WKN) as well 
as matching by name, since not all publicly listed compa- 
nies in Who owns Whom? have a security identiﬁer. I con- 
trol by hand that all matches are correct. 

Pyramid structures within corporations, i.e., subsidiaries 
owning subsidiaries, are common in Germany as they do 
not have the same tax disadvantages as in the U.S. ( Faccio 
and Lang, 2002 ). Therefore, I also take into account the eq- 
uity stakes of subsidiaries. I follow the equity stakes “up 
the ownership chain” as long as any link consists of at least 
75% ownership. To illustrate: if company A owns company 
B by at least 75%, I assign the equity stakes of company B 
to company A. I make sure that in such a case, company B 
does not enter the sample to avoid double counting. Basi- 
cally, company B is treated as a subsidiary of company A 
and not as an independent company. I choose the thresh- 
old of 75%, because 25% is the threshold for a blocking mi- 
nority in German corporation law. To illustrate: If company 
A owns 80% in company B and company B has a 10% eq- 
uity stake in company C, company A is treated as holding 
8% in company C and company B is not part of my sample. 
If A held only 60%, I would treat the equity stake as a 10% 
equity stake belonging to company B. 

C.2. Value of equity stakes 

I estimate the value of an equity stake in 1999 by mul- 
tiplying the percentage equity owned with my estimate of 
the ﬁrm’s market value. The percentage owned is reported 
in  the  Who  owns  Whom?  database.  For  equity  stakes  in 
publicly listed ﬁrms, I take the market value from Datas- 
tream or Compustat Global. For private companies, I esti- 

mate the market value using nominal capital (Kapital) as 
reported by Who owns Whom? First, I compute the ratio of 
market value to nominal capital for publicly listed compa- 
nies. Then, I estimate the market value of private compa- 
nies by multiplying their nominal capital with this ratio. 

C.3. Announcement returns 

I  use  SEDOLs  to  match  mergers  and  acquisition  data 
from  SDC  Platinum  data  to  the  other  data  sets.  I  assign 
an  acquisition  to  a  company  if  the  acquirer’s  SEDOL  or 
the acquirer’s parent SEDOL matches any of the company’s 
SEDOLs  or  the  SEDOL  of  a  company  in  which  the  com- 
pany owns at least 75%. For stock return data, I use Datas- 
tream  and  Compustat  Global.  Many  companies  have  dif- 
ferent share classes. I calculate the announcement returns 
based on the share class which is listed as “primary share 
class” on Datastream. Since individual equity return data 
in Datastream can sometimes have severe errors ( Ince and 
Porter, 2006 ), I set any daily return in Datastream or Com- 
pustat Global whose absolute value is above 20% to miss- 
ing. There are many days on which either Datastream or 
Compustat Global has missing return data. For each com- 
pany and each month, I choose the source that has fewer 
missing observations in that month. 

To compute alphas, I construct the four-factors of the 
Carhart (1997) model for Germany following the instruc-

tions on the website of Kenneth French. 
month Frankfurt interbank rate as the risk-free rate. As the 
market return, I use the Germany Datastream Index, which 
consists of 250 German companies. To compute HML, SMB, 
and MOM factors, I use only German companies for which 
I have market capitalization and a positive book value at 
the end of the prior year. At the beginning of each year, 
I split the ﬁrms into above/below median in terms of size 
and in Top 30%, Bottom 30%, and rest for market-to-book 
ratio. For the six portfolios thus formed, I compute value-

Table D.1 
Predictive regressions for payment method. 

This table displays a logit regression of payment method on differ- 
ent merger characteristics. The independent variable is a dummy variable 
equal to one if the acquisition was paid for at least partly in cash. Syn- 
opsis mentions “merger” is a dummy variable equal to one if the synopsis 
describing the acquisition contains the term “merge.” Sales of target is the 
sales of the target in million $, replaced with the sample mean if miss- 
ing. Asset purchase is a dummy variable equal to one if the consideration 
sought is listed as “Assets” in SDC Platinum. Increase in acquirer shares 
outstanding is a dummy variable equal to one if shares outstanding in- 
creased for the acquirer from one month before to one month after the 
effective date of the acquisition, and replaced by zero if missing. Sales 
of target missing and Increase in acquirer shares outstanding missing are 
dummy variables equal to one if the respective variable is missing. Other 
variables are deﬁned in Appendix A . All standard errors are clustered at 
the ﬁrm level. I report t -statistics below the coeﬃcients in parentheses.

Appendix D. Estimating payment methods 

SDC Platinum and Zephyr provide information on pay- 
ment method for only 27% of acquisitions. For the other 
acquisitions, I estimate payment method using the predic- 
tive regression presented below in Table D.1 . I regress pay- 
ment type on the different characteristics and use the coef- 
ﬁcients of this regression to predict the payment type for 
acquisitions without payment information. The regression 

2 of 35%. I create a new variable 
has a fairly high Pseudo- R 
called  Probability  of  cash  acquisition ,  which  is  the  proba- 
bility of a cash acquisition as predicted by this regression. 
For acquisitions without payment information, the average 
Probability of cash acquisition is 91%, which is much closer 
to the 93% of cash acquisitions than to the 55% of stock 
acquisitions. For 97% of the acquisitions without payment 
information, the probability of being a cash acquisition is 
above 75%, showing that the acquisitions without payment 
information have characteristics which suggest that most 
of them were cash acquisitions. 

The fact that most acquisitions without payment infor- 
mation are cash acquisitions is conﬁrmed in a simple com- 
parison of means shown below in Table D.2 . In this table, 
I display sample means for different variables for the three 
subsamples of stock acquisitions, cash acquisitions, and ac- 
quisitions without payment information. The means of the 
no payment information group are much closer to the cash 
acquisition group than to the stock acquisition group for all 
variables except Cross-border deal. This result suggests that 
the acquisitions without payment information are predom- 
inantly cash acquisitions.

Table D.2 
Acquisition characteristics by payment type. 

This table displays summary statistics on acquisition characteristics split by payment information. I split the sample into whether the 
acquisition was paid for using stock or cash or whether I do not have any payment information. I display the sample mean for different 
variables. Synopsis mentions “merger” is a dummy variable equal to one if the synopsis describing the acquisition contains the term “merge.”
Asset purchase is a dummy variable equal to one if the consideration sought is listed as “Assets” in SDC Platinum. Increase in acquirer shares 
outstanding is a dummy variable equal to one if shares outstanding increased for the acquirer from one month before to one month after 
the effective date of the acquisition. Probability of cash acquisition is the probability that the acquisition has been paid in cash as predicted 
by the regression model in Table D.1 . Other variables are deﬁned in Appendix A .

Table E.1 
Payment method by fraction of equity acquired. 

In this table, I display the payment methods in a sample of acquisitions of German companies between 20 0 0 and 20 07 
taken from SDC Platinum. I split the results by whether the acquirer sought to acquire 100%, less than 100% but more 
than 20%, or less than 20% of the company. Percentage with payment information gives the fraction of acquisitions that 
have payment information. Percentage of cash acquisitions gives the percentage of acquisitions that are at least partially 
paid in cash.

Appendix E. Payment methods for partial acquisitions 

In this appendix, I study how the payment method de- 
pends on the fraction of equity that a ﬁrm acquires. For 
this purpose, I use a sample of all acquisitions in SDC Plat- 
inum  undertaken  by  a  German  company  between  20 0 0 
and  2007  (even  if  they  are  not  related  to  companies  in 
my sample). I split this sample by percentage of shares ac- 
quired into three groups: full acquisitions (buyer acquires 
100%  of  target),  partial  acquisitions  (buyer  acquires  less 
than 100% but more than 20% of target), and acquisitions 
of equity stakes (buyer acquires less than 20% of target). I 
use the cutoff of 20% because it is the same cutoff I use to 
deﬁne an equity stake. For each of the samples I study the 
payment method as reported in SDC Platinum. 

I present the results in Table E.1 below. Acquisitions are 
more  likely  to  be  paid  in  cash  if  a  smaller  share  of  the 
company is purchased. For full acquisitions, 87.6% are paid 
in cash, while it is 93.1% for partial acquisitions and 96.8% 
for  acquisitions  of  equity  stakes.  While  these  results  are 
based only on the 27% of the sample for which payment 
information is available, the analysis in Appendix D sug- 
gests that acquisitions without payment information are at 

least as likely to be cash acquisitions as acquisitions with 
payment information. 

This analysis shows that acquisitions are more likely to 
be paid in cash the smaller the acquired stake in the com- 
pany. Speciﬁcally, about 97% of the acquisitions of similar 
≤20%) are paid 
size as the divestitures of the equity stakes ( 
in cash.
