For the ﬁrst time, we exploit quasi-experimental variation to investigate the impact of inheritance taxa-
tion on wealth accumulation. Using bunching and difference-in-differences methods, we directly estimate
several behavioral responses during lifetime, rather than relying solely on observations at death. Our empir-
ical ﬁndings shed new light upon wealth accumulation and bequest motives. Taken together, the small
responses to inheritance tax estimated cannot be supported by the desire to retain control over wealth.

1. Introduction

With growing inequalities in recent decades, demand for fair and
effective taxation has never been so high. Estate tax has a special
place in this framework. Wealth tends to be strongly concentrated
and can be transmitted from generation to generation. Progres-
sive taxation, therefore, may serve as an appropriate counter-force
against the perpetuation of inequality. However, estate tax gener-
ates behavioral responses from taxpayers, responses which may be
harmful to the macroeconomic success of an economy and may also
reduce the eﬃciency of taxation to curb wealth inequality.

An important literature has been built on the impact of transfer
taxation on economic behaviors.1 Empirical research on the partic-
ular impact of estate taxation on wealth accumulation, however, is
very scarce (Kopczuk and Slemrod, 2001; Holtz-Eakin and Marples,
2001; Joulfaian, 2006). This is due to the lack of good microdata
and the big identiﬁcation issue relative to this topic. Bequest and
wealth accumulation result from multiple factors occurring during
lifetime. Properly isolating the causal impact of estate taxation from

1 The literature has focused on the responsiveness of inter vivos gifts to changes
in the gift tax rates (Joulfaian, 2004; Ohlsson, 2011); on the responsiveness of
gifts to estate taxation (Arrondel and Laferrere, 2001; Page, 2003; Bernheim et
al., 2004); on the use of estate tax planning techniques through inter vivos gifts
(McGarry, 2000, 2001; Joulfaian, 2005; Nordblom and Ohlsson, 2006; Joulfaian, 2014);
and on the link between capital gains, gifts, and bequest taxes (Poterba, 2001;
Auten and Joulfaian, 2001). Receiving an inheritance can also impact the recipients
through labor supply and retirement decisions (Holtz-Eakin et al., 1993; Joulfaian and
Wilhelm, 1994; Brown et al., 2010; Elinder et al., 2012; Garbinti and Georges-Kot,
2016), entrepreneurship, and survival of existing small businesses (Holtz-Eakin et
al., 1994a,b; Brunetti, 2006; Tsoutsoura, 2015). It can also affect the level of wealth
inequality and savings behaviors of recipients (Elinder et al., 2016; Boserup et al.,
2016). See (Kopczuk, 2013, 2017) for a complete literature review of taxation of
intergenerational transfers and wealth.

other factors playing on wealth accumulation is, therefore, a crucial
challenge for the literature. A second issue is relative to the differ-
ent natures of behavioral responses (Slemrod, 1998; Chetty, 2009a).
Although recent progress has been made2, more work is still needed
to better analyze the different components of behavioral responses,
such as shifting among tax bases, timing, and real responses in an
inter-temporal framework (Saez et al., 2012).

This article breaks new ground on these questions using quasi-
experimental variation created by the French preferential tax
scheme for inheritance through the savings vehicle Assurance-vie.
We are able to make three contributions to the literature. First, we
directly estimate behavioral responses to inheritance tax during life-
time, rather than relying solely on observations at death. Second,
we estimate different types of behavioral responses using bunching
and difference-in-differences methods. Finally, our empirical ﬁnd-
ings shed new light upon wealth accumulation and bequest motives.
We show that our results cannot be supported by the desire to retain
control over wealth.

Assurance-vie is the most important ﬁnancial asset owned by
French households in 2010 and represents one quarter of total trans-
mission at death. Despite its name, Assurance-vie no longer has
insurance features; instead, it is used as a vehicle for wealth accumu-
lation and transmission. It is a ﬂexible “wrapper” or savings account
that holds ﬁnancial assets (equities, bonds. . . ) for tax purposes. In the
U.S., the closest equivalent of Assurance-vie accounts would be an
unlimited Roth IRA with preferential inheritance taxation.3

In 1992, France introduced a reform of the preferential tax
scheme for inheritance that was not retroactive. This reform gen-
erates large discontinuities depending on the opening date of
Assurance-vie accounts and the age at which contributions to the
accounts were made. For accounts opened after November 1991,
contributions made before age 70 beneﬁt from a preferential tax rate
of 20% after a speciﬁc tax exemption of 152,500 euros when trans-
mitted at death. In contrast, contributions made after age 70 are now
included in the inheritance tax base, with a much higher top tax rate.
As the reform was not retroactive, Assurance-vie accounts opened
before November 1991 have not been affected by the reform. When-
ever the contributions were made during lifetime, they are taxed at
the rate of 20% after the speciﬁc tax exemption of 152,500 euros
when transmitted at death. Hence, the reform provides a powerful
way of identifying the causal effect of inheritance taxation on wealth
accumulation directly during lifetime.

The increase in taxation after age 70 is likely to induce three
different behavioral responses. First, the reform has generated a
notch in the lifetime contributions of Assurance-vie, creating very
strong incentives to retime contributions just before age 70 (inter-
temporal shifting responses). We estimate these timing responses
using a bunching approach. Second, people can substitute contribu-
tions made after age 70 for other assets (shifting among asset port-
folio). Finally, they can reduce wealth accumulation in order to con-
sume more (real responses). We estimate these last two responses
using a difference-in-differences approach, based on the evolution of
contributions/account balances over age for Assurance-vie accounts
opened just before or after November 1991.

For this analysis, we have obtained ﬁrst-time access to a unique
longitudinal data set of French Assurance-vie accounts from AXA
over the 2003–2013 period. The study of the savings vehicle
Assurance-vie offers four important methodological and conceptual
advantages. First, our data set is the only source describing accu-
mulation of wealth for bequest purpose in a longitudinal way. This

setting allows us to estimate medium- and long-term responses to
inheritance tax based on changes occurring within individuals. Sec-
ond, our data set contains many very wealthy individuals, which
allows us to investigate whether behavioral responses increase with
wealth. Third, in France, Assurance-vie represents the major com-
ponent of ﬁnancial assets transmitted at death, which in theory are
the most sensitive to taxation. Our analysis provides a way of test-
ing to what extent this theory is supported by empirical evidence.
Finally, Assurance-vie occupies an original place between bequests
and gifts. It beneﬁts from preferential taxation but, contrary to gifts,
also provides a way to retain control over assets up to death. The
study of Assurance-vie accounts can help theory to better understand
the motivation behind wealth accumulation and bequest decisions.
Our analysis of the French preferential tax scheme yields two
main empirical results. First, we use a bunching approach to esti-
mate inter-temporal shifting elasticity in the medium term. We ﬁnd
compelling evidence of timing responses at age 70 increasing with
the level of wealth. Indeed, we show large and sharp excess bunch-
ing located exactly at the notch combined with slight but wide hole
(missing mass) above it. The tax change leads to an increase of 32%
in contributions made just before age 70 for the wealthy and 13% for
the rest of the population. In contrast, missing mass above the notch
leads to much more modest responses in the medium term, with
elasticities around 0.1 for both groups. As a result, we ﬁnd that strong
bunching can reﬂect modest inter-temporal shifting responses in the
medium term.

Second, we use a difference-in-differences setting to estimate
shifting among asset portfolio and real responses. Our results are
precisely estimated and robust to various speciﬁcation forms. We
obtain compelling evidence of a negative but small effect of inher-
itance tax on Assurance-vie contributions at the individual level.
It corresponds to an elasticity of 0.23 between 70 and 75 years
(long term4) up to 0.36 after 75 years old (medium term4). We then
investigate the cumulative impact of inheritance tax using account
balances instead of contributions as dependent variable. We ﬁnd a
modest but signiﬁcant elasticity of 0.29 after 75 years old. Our anal-
ysis has two important limitations. First, our data set does not allow
to observe assets held outside Assurance-vie accounts. Consequently,
we are not able to disentangle asset shifting from real responses,
and our estimated elasticities should be seen as an upper bound of
the true elasticity of taxable estate/wealth. Second, our estimates are
based on a tax change that occurs at age 70. We are thus capturing
a local average treatment effect that may not fully capture poten-
tial labor supply responses or life-cycle savings decisions occurring
earlier in time.

Our empirical ﬁndings shed new light on motivations behind
wealth accumulation and bequest motives. The underutilization of
gifts as a planning tool, as well as the strong responses from indi-
viduals at the onset of terminal illness, have been seen by the
literature as a desire of individuals to retain control over wealth up
to death (Kopczuk, 2007). In our case, however, small responses to
taxation cannot be explained by this motive. Indeed, Assurance-vie
accounts provide a way to retain control over assets up to death. We
also show that the small magnitude of these responses cannot be
explained by an absence of tax salience and are not consistent with
forward-looking individuals’ decisions.

More generally, our paper relates to the literatures on optimal
inheritance taxation (Farhi and Werning, 2010; Piketty and Saez,
2013), suﬃcient statistic approach (Chetty, 2009b), and modelling
of wealth distribution (De Nardi and Fella, 2017) by providing new
insights on bequest motives and elasticities to estate tax. It is also

of tax avoidance relative to the timing of death. Recently, Seim (2017) was able to
estimate tax avoidance and evasion to the Swedish wealth tax.

4 Because life expectancy is approximately equal to 80 years, the medium term cor-
responds to 5 years before death, and the long term corresponds to 5–10 years before
death.

related to the large literature on 401(k) and IRA that study how
public policies affect wealth accumulation through savings accounts
(Chetty et al., 2014; Gelber, 2011; Engelhardt and Kumar, 2007;
Bernheim, 2002, among others).

The article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the French
institutional background and the data we use. Section 3 presents the
empirical analysis. Section 4 concludes.

2. Institutional background and data

The complexity of the French inheritance tax system has always
been a nightmare for an audience not familiar with its intricacies.
We will not dwell here on these complexities, but a short presenta-
tion is in order, as it will help make sense of the empirical strategy
used in this paper. This section will offer a general overview of the
inheritance tax system in France. It will then present a deﬁnition of
Assurance-vie in France and explain how it is taxed. Finally, it will
describe the data used.

2.1. Transfer taxation in France

The French transfer taxation differs strongly from the system in
the U.S. for at least three reasons. The partition of the estate among
heirs is set in part by law. France has developed a progressive inher-
itance tax system, in which tax rates and tax exemptions depend
on the wealth received by each successor and the kin relationship
with the deceased. Assurance-vie accounts and gifts beneﬁt from
preferential tax schemes.

French inheritance laws have not changed signiﬁcantly since
the implementation of the civil Code by Napoleon in 1804. In
order to protect children from being disenfranchised, only part
of the estate called the disposable portion (“quotité disponible”)
is freely disposable. The remaining part, called the reserved por-
tion (“réserve héréditaire”),
is automatically earmarked for the
deceased’s children.5 The amount of la réserve and the amount freely
disposable depend on the number of the deceased’s children. For n
children, the reserved portion is set to n/n + 1 of the estate and the
disposable portion to 1/n + 1.

Unlike the U.S., the French transfer taxation takes the form of a
progressive inheritance tax based on the net assets received by each
successor. The tax schedule and tax exemptions vary according to
the relationship of the inheritor to the deceased. Since 2007, sur-
viving spouses are fully exempted. Table 1 reports the inheritance
tax schedule for children in 2010. Marginal tax rates range from 5%
to 40% after an exemption of 156,974 euros per children.6 Table 2
reports the inheritance tax schedule for collateral heirs (from a par-
allel line of the deceased’s family) in 2010. The tax schedule is almost
ﬂat, with high tax rates ranging from 35% to 60% 7 and low tax
exemptions.8

From 1942 to 1992, inter vivos gifts were fully integrated to the
inheritance tax in order to achieve a complete neutrality between
gift and bequest.9 The same graduated tax schedules applied to
both bequests and gifts; most importantly, all inter vivos gifts were
“recalled” when the donor died and were added to the bequest left at

death. As a result, each heir ended up paying taxes on the basis of the
total estate that he or she received from the decedent.10 In 1992, the
French government introduced the “10 year rule”: gifts made more
than 10 years before the time of death are no longer recalled in the
estate. This rule implies that the tax exemption is no longer a life-
time exemption, but it can be renewed every 10 years. Since 2012,
the “10 year rule” has become a “15 year rule.”

2.2. What is Assurance-vie in France?

Assurance-vie is now the most widespread ﬁnancial asset in
France. Over a third of the French population has an Assurance-
vie account, and it represents 38% of the ﬁnancial assets owned
by households and 23% of total transmission at death.11 It is used
to ﬁnance supplemental retirement beneﬁts, long-term ﬁnancial
projects, or transmission at death.

As 401(k) and IRA, Assurance-vie accounts are a ﬂexible savings
vehicle. They can hold almost any publicly quoted ﬁnancial instru-
ments as well as property and loans.12 The value of the Assurance-vie
account corresponds to the market value of the ﬁnancial products
held into the account. But Assurance-vie is not a retirement account,
and contributions are transferred from individual bank accounts
instead of being deducted from the employee’s paycheck. Assurance-
vie is also much more ﬂexible. Contributions are unlimited and can
be made at any age. They can be discretionary or automatic. The
latter implies that individuals have to choose the frequency (on a
monthly/quarterly/half-yearly or yearly basis) and the level of auto-
matic contributions.13 Assurance-vie accounts are also never locked.
Individuals can request a cash withdrawal, convert the capital into

5 The surviving spouse is only considered as protected heir in the absence of chil-
dren. In this case, the reserved portion accruing to the surviving spouse is equal to 25%
of the estate.

6 The top marginal tax rate has been ﬁxed to 45% since 2011, while the tax

exemption decreased from 156,974 euros to 100,000 euros in 2012.

7 For brothers and sisters, the marginal tax rate is equal to 35% below 24,069 euros
and 45% above it. For nephews and nieces, the inheritance is taxed at a ﬂat rate of 55 %.
8 The tax exemption is equal to 15,697 euros for brothers and sisters, and 7849

euros for nephews and nieces.

9 In reality, there has never been a step-up in value of what was given before death.
Only the nominal amount given is recalled into the inheritance tax base at the time of
death.

10 The tax paid at the time of the gift is deducted from the tax liability computed at
the time of death on the sum of gift and bequest. I.e., if t(.) is the relevant tax schedule,
v is the gift, and b is the bequest, then one pays tax t(v) at the time of the gift, and
t(b + v)− t(v) at the time of death, so that the total tax payment is t(b + v).
11 In 2013, Assurance-vie represents 15% of total private wealth and 38% of ﬁnancial
assets, according to French National Accounts from INSEE (France’s National Institute
of Statistics). The aggregate ﬂow of Assurance-vie transmitted at death comes from
the Fédération Française des Sociétés d’Assurances (French association of insurance
companies). The bequest ﬂow comes from Enquêtes Mutation à Titre Gratuit (sample
of estate tax returns collected by the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance).
12 In practice, individuals invest mainly in managed funds and euro funds.
13 These parameters can be changed at any time.

a lifetime annuity, or just close down the account at any time with-
out any age restrictions.14 At death, the account is transmitted to the
beneﬁciaries.

Table 3 reports summary statistics on wealth and Assurance-vie
accounts among individuals aged 60–80 years old in France in 2010.
Four facts are worth noting. First, the proportion of Assurance-vie
account holders increases with the level of wealth. While only 21%
of the poorest half of the elderly population owns an account, this
number increases to 72% for the top 10% and 83% for the top 1%.
Second, Assurance-vie assets are strongly concentrated among the
wealthiest individuals. The top 25%, top 10% and top 1% wealthiest
elderly owns 83%, 68% and 32% of total Assurance-vie assets, respec-
tively. Third, Assurance-vie assets represent 15%–30 % of total wealth
of the account holders. This number is equal to 20% for account hold-
ers from the top 10% wealth group. Finally, Assurance-vie assets are
more concentrated than total wealth.

Assurance-vie occupies a singular place in the French tax land-
scape. Until 1992, Assurance-vie accounts transmitted at death were
fully exempt from inheritance tax. The purpose of this preferential
tax scheme was to foster the development of domestic long-term
savings and thus safeguard the ﬁnancing of the economy from for-
eign investments. The increasing cost and the perverse effects of this
scheme led the government to come back progressively on the pref-
erential tax treatment of Assurance-vie transmitted at death in 1992
and 1998.

The 1992 reform has narrowed the scope of the preferential tax
scheme to contributions made before age 70. The fraction of contribu-
tions made before age 70 remained exempt from inheritance taxation.
In contrast, those made after age 70 were recalled into the inheri-
tance tax base after an estate-level exemption of 30,000 euros.15 As
the 1992 reform was not retroactive, Assurance-vie accounts opened
before 11/20/199116 remained fully tax exempt. The 1998 reform
has limited the ﬁscal advantage of the preferential tax scheme for
Assurance-vie. Instead of being fully tax exempt, all contributions
not recalled into the inheritance tax base are now taxed at a ﬂat
rate of 20% after a supplemental tax exemption of 152,500 euros
by inheritor. Four facts are worth noting. First, when Assurance-vie
accounts are transmitted at death, the ﬁnancial institutions auto-
matically send the share of contributions made after and before age
70 to the ﬁscal administration. Second, it is the total of all contribu-
tions made during lifetime (and not the balance of the Assurance-vie
account at death) that are either subjected to the preferential tax

scheme or recalled into the inheritance tax base.17 Capitalized inter-
ests, dividends, and capital gains are therefore exempt from taxation.
Third, inheritors can beneﬁt simultaneously from three different tax
exemptions: the speciﬁc exemption of 152,500 euros per inheritor
applied to contributions made before age 70, the estate-level exemp-
tion of 30,000 euros applied to contributions made after age 70, and
ﬁnally, the inheritance tax exemption applied to contributions made
after age 70 and other assets transmitted at death.18 Finally, the sur-
viving spouse is fully tax exempt from both the inheritance tax and
the preferential tax scheme since 2007.

Despite the upward trend in the tax burden, contributions
recalled into the inheritance tax base are still subject to a preferen-
tial taxation for at least three reasons. First, an Assurance-vie account
is not considered as part of the estate and can therefore constitute a
way to get around the rigid “reserved portion” rule. Second, capital-
ized interests, dividends, and capital gains from contributions made
after age 70 are exempt from inheritance taxation. Finally, even con-
tributions recalled in the inheritance tax base are less taxed than
other assets due to the additional estate-level exemption of 30,000
euros.

Table 4 summarizes the taxation of Assurance-vie at death since
1998, depending on the opening date of Assurance-vie accounts and
age at which contributions are made. The reforms of the preferen-
tial tax scheme have introduced a much higher top statutory tax
rate on contributions made after age 70 for accounts opened after
November 20, 1991. As we discuss in more detail in Section 3, this
quasi-experimental variation is used to estimate different behav-
ioral responses to inheritance tax in an inter-temporal framework.
First, we exploit the notch created around age 70 to estimate tim-
ing responses using a bunching approach. Second, we exploit the fact
that the increase in taxation applies only to Assurance-vie accounts
opened after November 20, 1991 to estimate shifting among asset
portfolio and real responses in a difference-in-differences setting.

As shown in Table 5, Assurance-vie accounts beneﬁt also to a pref-
erential income tax. The taxation of capital income from Assurance-vie
depends on the opening date of the account and the length of time that
the account has been in force. We argue that the variations induced by
this scheme should not affect our estimation of behavioral responses
to inheritance taxation. Indeed, the estimation of timing responses
relies on a bunching approach induced by the formation of a notch at
age 70. As income taxation of Assurance-vie does not vary discontin-
uously at age 70, the estimation should not be biased. The estimation

14 Distributions are allocated between principal and earnings on a prorata basis.
15 This estate-level exemption is split among heirs proportionally to the share of
post-70 contributions inherited.
16 In order to avoid massive timing responses, the 1992 reform was applied to
accounts opened after 11/20/1992, i.e. the date the reform was oﬃcially announced
and discussed at Parliament.

17 However, when the end-of-life balance is lower than the total of all contributions,
the inheritance tax is computed on the end-of-life balance. In this case, the tax
administration compute the share of end-of-life balance that will be subject to the
preferential tax scheme or recalled into the inheritance tax base on a prorata basis
using the share of contributions made before or after age 70.
18 The inheritance tax exemption varies depending on the kin relationship between
the inheritor and the decedent.

The empirical analysis is based on a French longitudinal data
set from the ﬁnancial company AXA over the 2003–2013 period.
It includes detailed information about Assurance-vie accounts and
socio-demographic variables of all French clients at AXA at a monthly
frequency. More importantly, our data set contains the daily date at
which contributions were made. The main limitation of our data set
is that it has been constructed only for accounting purposes. Conse-
quently, the data set neither include assets held outside Assurance-vie
accounts nor the relationship between the account holder and the
beneﬁciaries.

This data set regroups two categories of individuals. The ﬁrst
group corresponds to individuals opening a standard preferential tax
savings vehicle (referred to as “standard individuals”). The second
group corresponds to individuals that entrust AXA with the man-
agement of their wealth (referred to as “wealthy individuals”). A
minimum capital subscription of hundreds of thousands of euros
is required to beneﬁt from personalized management of wealth.19
Therefore, Assurance-vie accounts from the second group are sig-
niﬁcantly more important than those from the ﬁrst one. Note that
the distinction between “wealthy” and “standard” individuals does
not vary over time and only depends on whether the accounts are
managed by a portfolio manager.

We focus our analysis on individuals aged between 60 and
80 years who have not terminated their accounts during lifetime. As
described previously, individuals can open an Assurance-vie account
for three main reasons: constitute a cash reserve to buy a real
estate property, ﬁnance supplemental retirement beneﬁts, or leave
a bequest. As we want to investigate the impact of inheritance tax
on wealth accumulation, only contributions made for bequest pur-
poses are relevant in our framework. Consequently, we restrict our
sample to individuals aged between 60 and 80 years. Indeed, these
individuals are already retired20 and are therefore less likely to make
contributions for retirement purposes. They have also had time to
accumulate a cash reserve to buy their property. Contributions made
by individuals over age 60 should therefore be mainly driven by
a bequest motive. In addition, we exclude from our analysis indi-
viduals who have terminated their Assurance-vie accounts during

19 The minimum capital required depends on the ﬁnancial products contained by the
account. Relatives to wealthy clients, such as spouses and children, can also open an
account with a portfolio manager without having the minimum capital required.
20 In France, most individuals retired at the legal retirement age of 60 (62 since
2010).

lifetime. Their contributions will not be transmitted at death and are
therefore not relevant in our analysis.

The resulting sample is an unbalanced panel of individuals aged
between 60 and 80 years. Three factors can explain attrition. First,
individuals can die. Second, individuals can be observed eleven years
at most because our data set covers only the period 2003–2013.21
Finally, individuals can open an account after age 60. In this case,
they are not recorded in our data set from age 60 to the age at which
the account is opened. We correct for the latter by considering that,
before opening their account, individuals have an account balance of
0 euro and do not make any contributions to it. Although the panel
is unbalanced, the only reasons for attrition are age restrictions and
death. Therefore, attrition should not bias our results. Indeed, age
restrictions and probability to die are the same among treated and
control groups in the difference-in-differences approach. The bunch-
ing analysis should also not be impacted by attrition as the reasons
for attrition do not vary discontinuously at age 70.

We now present two methodological choices that we have done
regarding multiple accounts and joint accounts. First, individuals can
open multiple accounts either at AXA or at different institutions. At
AXA, the average number of accounts per individual is 1.3. Usually,
individuals with multiple accounts opened one account per beneﬁ-
ciary at the same time. While we are not able to observe accounts
opened outside AXA, we argue that the proportion of individuals
opening accounts both at AXA and at different institutions should
be small. Indeed, each institution offers a very rich variety of invest-
ments that can be held in Assurance-vie accounts. Reducing ﬁnancial
risks by opening multiple accounts in several institutions is therefore
irrelevant in this framework because ﬁnancial risks can be reduced
by holding different ﬁnancial products inside a unique Assurance-vie
account. In addition, there are no ﬁscal incentives to open several
accounts for a same heir.22 As individuals (rather than accounts)
are the appropriate unit of analysis, we have done the following
adjustments. For the bunching approach, we have grouped together
all accounts opened after 11/20/1991 by a same individual. For the
difference-in-differences approach, we have grouped together all
accounts opened up to two years before 11/20/1991 (respectively
after 11/20/1991) by a same individual. Second, husband and wife
can open different types of joint accounts (ﬁrst-to-die or second-to-
die accounts) depending on their matrimonial regime. We exclude
these accounts from our analysis because we are not able to observe
whether each joint account is a ﬁrst-to-die or a second-to-die account
and which of the co-owners is likely to die ﬁrst. As joint accounts are
very uncommon (2% of all accounts in the data set), their exclusion
should not have any impact on our results.

Table 6 investigates whether our sample (AXA data set) is repre-
sentative of French Assurance-vie account holders. The methodology
is the following. Using the 2010 French household wealth survey, we
rank account holders aged 60–80 years old by Assurance-vie account
balance and regroup them into six groups (P0–25, P25–50, P50–75,
P75–90, P90–99 and P99–100). We report the threshold, the average
account balance and the average wealth of each group in columns 2,
3 and 4 ofTable 6. For the year 2010, we compute the proportion of
AXA account holders aged 60–80 years old belonging to each group
(column 6) and the average account balance of each group (column
7). If the AXA data set is fully representative of French Assurance-vie

21 A person age 80 in 2013 will be included in the sample from age 69 (1/1/2003) to
age 80 (12/31/2013). A person age 65 in 2013 will be included in the sample from age
60 (in 2008) to age 65 (in 2013).
22 The Assurance-vie tax exemption of 152,500 euros (applied to contributions made
before age 70) is an heir’s exemption, which does not vary with the number of accounts
inherited. The estate-level exemption of 30,000 euros (applied to contributions made
after age 70) is split among heirs proportionally to the share of post-70 contributions
they inherited. This estate-level exemption is therefore identical whether an heir
inherit the same amount from one or several accounts.

account holders, the proportion of AXA account holders belonging
to each group will be equal to the size of the group, i.e. 25% of AXA
account holders will belong to the ﬁrst quartile of French account
holders (P0–25) and 1% to the last centile (P99–100). The compari-
son of columns 1 and 7 indicates that our sample is representative of
French Assurance-vie account holders with some discrepancy at the
extremes of the distribution. 34% of AXA account holders belong to
the bottom 25% poorest French account holders, 7% to the top 10%
and 0.7% to the top 1%.23

Column 5 reports the correspondence between the groups of
account holders ranked by level of account balance and wealth groups.
It shows that French Assurance-vie account holders are wealthier
than the overall elderly French population. The bottom 25% poorest
account holders (ranked by level of account balance) have an average
wealth of 196,166 euros. The average wealth of P0–25 Assurance-vie
group correspond to P50–75 wealth group for French elderly popula-
tion. Account holders from P25–50 and P50–75 Assurance-vie account
groups belong to the P75–90 wealth group. Account holders from
P75–90, P90–99 and P99–100 belong to P90–95, P95–99 and P99–100
wealth groups, respectively.

Table 7 presents summary statistics. Panel A corresponds to the
sample used for the bunching approach. It includes individuals aged
between 60 and 80 years with accounts opened after 11/20/1991.
Panel A shows the following. First, individuals make an average
contribution of 7100 euros every 17 months. Second, the value of
the accounts and the contributions made by the wealthy individuals
are strongly higher than those from the standard individuals. Third,

23 In Online Appendix Table 13, we conduct the same exercise on the two distinct
sub-samples of “wealthy” and “standard” individuals. We show that “wealthy”
individuals from AXA sample are relatively wealthier than total French Assurance-
vie account holders: 15% of AXA “wealthy” account holders belong to the bottom 25%
poorest French account holders, 19% to the top 10% and 3.2% to the top 1%. “Standard”
individuals from AXA sample are relatively poorer than the French account holders:
37% of AXA “standard” account holders belong to the bottom 25% poorest French
account holders, 5% to the top 10% and 0.3% to the top 1%.

the distribution of Assurance-vie accounts is extremely skewed. The
top 1% hold close to 30% of total Assurance-vie assets. Fourth, the
data set includes 7.6 million observations, corresponding to 340,000
individuals observed during 22 quarters (5 to 6 years).

Panel B presents the particular sub-sample used for the difference-
in-differences approach. It includes individuals aged between 60 and
80 years with accounts opened up to two years before or after the
1992 reform of the preferential tax scheme. As compared to Panel
A, individuals from Panel B have opened their account for a longer
period of time. Consequently, the duration of the account is twice as
big as in the Panel A. The value of the account is also more important,
whereas the contributions made are signiﬁcantly less important and
less frequent. This is due to the fact that individuals from Panel B have
already reallocated a part of their wealth into Assurance-vie accounts.
Thecontributionsmayresultmainlyfromnewaccumulationofwealth
rather than substitution effect among portfolio assets.

3. Empirical approach

In the following section, we estimate the impact of inheritance
taxation on wealth accumulation. Our strategy takes advantage of
the fact that Assurance-vie accounts transmitted at death are taxed
differently, whether contributions were made before or after age
70. As shown in Fig. 1, the increase in taxation at age 70 is likely to
generate timing, shifting among asset portfolio, and real responses.
Individuals can avoid the increase in taxation by retiming con-
tributions just before age 70. This behavior should generate excess
bunching located exactly at the notch combined with hole after age
70. For accounts opened after 1991, we can therefore estimate timing
responses in the medium run using a bunching approach (Fig. 2 A).

The increase in taxation can also generate a reduction of
Assurance-vie accumulation. This reduction could reﬂect either shift-
ing among asset portfolio or wealth disaccumulation (real and shifting
responses). We exploit the fact that the tax change implemented in
1992 is not retroactive in order to estimate these responses. Accounts

Note: This table presents a number of summary statistics coming from AXA longitudinal data set over the 2003–2013 period. Panel A corresponds to
the sample used for the bunching approach. It includes individuals aged between 60 and 80 years with accounts opened after the implementation of the
preferential tax scheme reform. “Standard” refers to individuals opening a standard account. “Wealthy” refers to wealthy individuals that entrust AXA
with the management of their wealth. Panel B shows the sample used for the difference-in-differences approach. It includes individuals aged between 60
and 80 years with accounts opened up to two years before or after the reform of the preferential tax scheme.

opened just after November 20, 1991 are indeed subject to the taxation
change after age 70, while those opened just before the implementa-
tion of the reform encounters no change in taxation during lifetime.

Wetakeadvantageofthisdifference-in-differencessettingtoestimate
medium- and long-term responses to taxation (Fig. 2B).

To facilitate comparisons of our estimates with those from the
literature, we translate our estimates into elasticities using the dif-
ference between the top marginal inheritance tax rate for children
(40%) and the ﬂat tax rate of the preferential tax scheme (20%).
More speciﬁcally, we divide our estimates by the difference in log
net-of-tax rates, i.e. log(1 − 0.4) − log(1 − 0.2). This metric is not
fully accurate.24 Indeed, marginal tax rates depend on the total
wealth received by each successor and the kin relationship with the
deceased, which are not available in our data set. However, we argue
that using changes in top marginal tax rates for children could be the
closest approximation of the true metric. First, Assurance-vie assets
are mainly transmitted to children (65%) and in a lower proportion
to relatives in collateral lines (26%), which face ﬂat tax rates close to

Fig. 1. Behavioral responses induced by the preferential tax scheme.

24 Note that for individuals who would face a lower tax rate, the responses would
be attributed to a smaller tax change and a larger elasticity. Our approximation can
therefore generate a lower bound on the elasticity.

3.1. Timing responses due to the notch

3.1.1. Empirical methodology and identiﬁcation

Estimation of timing responses takes advantage of the formation
of a notch induced by the permanent change in taxation starting from
age 70. More precisely, strong and permanent increase in taxation
at age 70 introduces an incentive to retime contributions before the
tax change takes place. As a result, the empirical function of con-
tributions should exhibit excess bunching at age 70 and a hole just
above the cutoff. We can then derive reduced-form estimates of tim-
ing responses by comparing the empirical function to an estimate of
the smooth counterfactual that would be expected in the absence of
notch. The identiﬁcation assumption underlying causal inference is
that the empirical function would have been smooth if there were no
jump in the tax rate. In order to assess the validity of the identifying
assumption, online Appendix Fig. 5 depicts the empirical contribu-
tions by age for accounts opened before 11/20/1991. As the 1992
law is not retroactive, this group encounters no taxation change at
age 70. Consistency with our identifying assumption, the empirical
function exhibits no bunching at age 70.

We now address one potential concern with our approach. As
shown in Fig. 1, the tax change at age 70 is likely to induce other behav-
ioral responses, such as shifting among asset portfolio and wealth
disaccumulation. These responses may affect the observed contri-
butions above the cutoff. Therefore, the estimated counterfactual is
not stripped of all behavioral responses. As emphasized by Kleven
and Waseem (2013), the estimation approach is still valid as long
as the counterfactual is stripped of timing responses. In addition,
we will be able to estimate these other behavioral responses using
difference-in-differences approach in the next section.

Following recent developments in bunching literature (Saez, 2010;
Chetty et al., 2011; Kleven and Waseem, 2013), we ﬁrst estimate a
counterfactual function of contributions in the absence of notch. To
do so, we ﬁt a ﬂexible polynomial to the empirical function, excluding
data in a range around the notch.27 The estimation model takes the
following form:

ca = E [log(yia + 1) | age = a] =

J(cid:2)

j=0

• (agea)j +

bj

au(cid:2)

k=al

ck

• 1agea=k + ea

where the dependent variable is the average log of (individual-level con-
tribution+1) made by individuals of age a, (agea)j are ﬂexible polynomial
ﬁts for age, [al, au] is the excluded range around the notch point, and ea
is the residual resulting from potential misspeciﬁcation of the model.

The counterfactual function is then:28

ˆca =

ˆ
bj

J(cid:2)

j=0

• (agea)j

(2)

27 The lower bound of the excluded region is set at the point where excess bunching
starts. The upper bound of the excluded range is estimated using the “point of
convergence” method as described by Kleven and Waseem (2013). Starting from an
upper bound just above the age cutoff, we estimate the empirical and the counterfactual
functions of contributions and compute the resulting missing mass and bunching
mass. For a low value of the upper bound, the bunching mass is much larger than
the missing mass. We iteratively increase the upper bound until the missing mass
converges to the bunching mass.
28 We can deﬁne a bunching parameter b, which is the excess mass in the excluded
range below the notch ¯a in proportion to the counterfactual contribution at the notch
such as:

b =

the top marginal tax rate for children (see Tables 1 and 2).25 Second,
Table 6 shows that AXA account holders are representative of the
wealthiest quartile of the elderly population. With an average wealth
of 5.8 million euros, the top 1% wealthiest account holder faces top
marginal inheritance tax rates with certainty. Using top marginal tax
rates could also be a good approximation for the remaining account
holders. Most of these individuals would face at least a marginal tax
rate of 20% in absence of the preferential tax scheme.26 With the
preferential tax scheme, they can beneﬁt from a supplemental tax
exemption of 152,500 euros and therefore face a marginal tax rate
of 0%. The change in net-of-tax rates would therefore be equal to
log(1 − 0.2), which is close to log(1 − 0.4) − log(1 − 0.2).

This section will be organized in three parts. The ﬁrst part
presents the estimation of timing responses using bunching estima-
tion techniques. The second part is dedicated to the estimation of real
and shifting responses using difference-in-differences approach. The
third part summarizes and discusses the results.

25 Using the 2010 micro-sample of inheritance tax returns, we ﬁnd that 65% of
contributions made after age 70 are transmitted to children, 26% to heirs in collateral
line and 9% to surviving spouse. This micro-sample, called “DMTG ﬁle”, is produced
by the French ministry of ﬁnance. The wealthiest decedents are heavily oversampled,
so that DMTG ﬁle can be representative of the very top of the distribution. The 2010
DMTG ﬁle includes only the fraction of contributions made after age 70 rather than
total balances of Assurance-vie accounts.
26 The 20% inheritance tax bracket ranges from 15,697 euros to 544,173 euros.

29

Finally, we can obtain reduced-form estimates of

timing

responses by ﬁtting the following regression model:

ca = E [log(yia + 1) | age = a] =

J(cid:2)

j=0

• (agea)j

bj

+c1

• 1al≤agea≤¯a + c2

• 1¯a<agea≤au + ea

(3)

where the dependent variable is the average log of (individual-level con-
tribution + 1) made by individuals of age a,1al≤agea≤¯a and 1¯a<agea≤au are
respectively dummies for age a being in the excluding range below or
above the notch.

The coeﬃcient we are interested in is c2 (medium-term timing
responses). It corresponds to the difference of average contributions
(in log) between the empirical and the counterfactual functions in
the excluded range above the notch. Note that we add one euro to
each individual-level contribution in order to include zero contribu-
tions in the analysis, because dropping them could bias the results
downward. The jump in taxation around age 70 is likely to increase
the proportion of zero contributions just after age 70 and decrease it
just before age 70. Dropping zero contributions would therefore arti-
ﬁcially increase the average log of contributions just after age 70 and
would under-estimate the magnitude of the timing responses.29

Our methodology differs slightly from traditional bunching esti-
mation techniques for at least two reasons. First, our approach is
based on an inter-temporal setting. The taxation occurs only at death
but depends on the age at which contributions were made. Therefore,
the relevant dependent variable is the amount of contributions made
instead of the number of individuals or accounts by age.30 Second, the
difference between the empirical and the counterfactual functions
above the notch (c2) corresponds to the magnitude of medium-term
timing responses, i.e. what proportion of contributions have been
retimed after age 70. Finally, the size of the hole determines the length
of the horizon over which there is retiming. Usually, the estimation of
medium-term responses is diﬃcult to convincingly identify because
tax change and time effects are not dissociable. The originality of our
estimation comes from the fact that the tax change is associated with
age. By pooling together different cohorts of individuals over a long
period of time, we can then properly isolate medium-term timing
responses from time-varying or age-varying factors.

3.1.2. Results

Fig. 3 reports empirical and counterfactual contributions (in log)
by quarterly age around the notch. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 3 is split into
two panels. Panel A makes reference to wealthy individuals with
accounts under the supervision of portfolio manager (“wealthy indi-
viduals”). Panel B corresponds to individuals with standard accounts
(“standard individuals”).31 Each panel shows the estimate of b, i.e.
excess mass divided by the average contributions at the notch, with
its standard error shown in parentheses.

Our main ﬁndings are the following. First, we observe bunching
concentrated just during the last quarter before 70 years old in both
panels. The size of the bunching differs signiﬁcantly depending on
the level of wealth. Panel A depicts important bunching correspond-
ing to 0.83 times the height of the counterfactual contribution at age

29 As a sensitivity analysis, we have also added two euros (instead of one euro) to
each contribution and the results are unchanged (see online Appendix Table 14).
30 The increase in taxation at age 70 should only affect the amount of contributions
made. As Assurance-vie transmission and taxation will occur only at death, individuals
having opened an account before age 70 will keep this account until death. Therefore,
the distribution of the number of accounts by age remains smoothed and exhibits
no discontinuity at age 70 (online Appendix Fig. 6).
31 Online Appendix Fig. 7 reports the evolution of account balances and different
types of contributions (discretionary, automatic, and account-opening contributions)
by quarterly age.

B) FOR STANDARD INDIVIDUALS

Fig. 3. Contributions by age around the notch, France 2003–2013. Notes: Fig. 3A and
B reports empirical and counterfactual contributions (in log) by quarterly age. More
precisely, it displays the average log of (individual-level contributions + 1) by quar-
terly age. The sample corresponds to French Assurance-vie accounts opened after
11/20/1991 over the 2003–2013 period. Fig. 3A corresponds to wealthy individuals
with accounts under the supervision of portfolio manager. Fig. 3B corresponds to indi-
viduals with standard accounts. At the notch (denoted by the vertical line), taxation
changes radically. Contributions made before age 70 are taxed at a ﬂat rate of 20 %
after an exemption of 152,500 euros. Contributions made after 70 are recalled into
the inheritance tax base with top marginal tax rate going up to 40 %. The counterfac-
tual contributions are estimated as in Eqs. (1) and (2), using a polynomial of order 4.
The vertical dashed lines denote the upper and lower bounds of the excluded region
around the notch. The lower bound of the excluded region is set at the point where
excess bunching starts while the upper bound is chosen, such as bunching mass equals
missing mass. b is the estimate of the excess mass divided by the average contribu-
tions at the notch, with its standard error shown in parentheses. All standard errors are
obtained by block-bootstrap procedure at the individual level with 600 replications.

70 for the wealthy. Panel B shows moderate bunching correspond-
ing to 0.16 times the height of the counterfactual contributions for
the standard individuals. Second, both notches are associated with
a slight but wide hole above the cutoff. Finally, the horizon of tim-
ing responses is 3 years for wealthy individuals and 1.5 years for
standard individuals.

Table 8 A presents reduced-form estimates of timing responses
and inter-temporal shifting elasticity with respect to the net-of-
tax rate.32 The elasticities corresponding to medium-term timing

32 Note that our bunching approach allows to identify reduced-form rather than
structural responses. Our estimated responses are therefore a combination of the
structural behavioral responses and other factors such as preference for bequest and
consumption and liquidity constraints.

Note: The table shows the absolute values of timing responses and reduced-form

Timing responses are directly obtained from the estimation of Eq. (3). Medium-term
timing responses correspond to c2. Standard errors are obtained by block-bootstrap
procedure at the individual level with 600 replications. The reduced-form elasticities
are computed by dividing timing responses by log(1 − 0.4) − log(1 − 0.2), and the
standard errors associated are derived by the delta method.

responses are equal for both groups to 0.10. As described in online
Appendix Tables 15 and 16, our results are robust to the choice of
functional form for the counterfactual function. They are also robust
to the choice of the upper part of the excluded zone.

The contrast between important bunching and modest resulting
timing responses can be explained easily. The increase in taxation has
only reduced by 2%–3% the contributions that would have been made
after age 70. However, the overall reduction of contributions observed
during several years after age 70 has been entirely shifted just before
age 70. Consequently, we observe important bunching mass just
before age 70, although it only reﬂects modest inter-temporal shifting
responses in the medium run.

Timing horizon constitutes a crucial parameter in the particular
framework of inter-temporal shifting responses. It reﬂects the max-
imum length of the horizon over which individuals are able to shift
contributions. Timing horizon is twice as large for the wealthy as it
is for standard individuals.

Wealthy individuals differ from standard individuals for two rea-
sons. First, they are richer. Second, they have someone actively
managing their wealth. Differences of timing responses or timing
horizon among groups could therefore be explained either by asym-
metric information (salience of tax) or wealth differences (liquidity
constraints). In order to isolate the proper effect of wealth differ-
ences on timing responses, Table 8 B presents results for wealthy and
standard individuals with similar account balance (between 100,000
euros and 700,000 euros) during the initial period. If differences
in timing horizon and timing responses between groups are due
to asymmetric information, then these differences should remain
when comparing timing horizon and timing responses of standard
and wealthy individuals with similar account balances. In contrast,
Table 8 B shows similar timing responses and horizon of tax planning
between groups with similar account balances. The differences in
timing horizon in Table 8 A can therefore not be attributed to differ-
ential tax salience among groups. If liquidity constraints are likely to
play on the magnitude of timing horizon and timing responses, then
timing horizon and timing responses should be higher for individu-
als without liquidity constraints. The comparison of timing responses
between Panels A and B shows that timing responses are higher for
standard and wealthy individuals with accounts between 100,000
euros and 700,000 euros. These individuals belong to the top 20%

wealthiest AXA account holder group and should not face any liquid-
ity constraints.33 Therefore, liquidity constraints is likely to affect the
magnitude of timing responses. However, both timing responses and
timing horizon remain limited among individuals without liquidity
constraints. These individuals have only reduced by 6% the contri-
butions that would have been made after age 70, corresponding to
medium-term timing responses equal for both groups to 0.21.

In summary, our bunching analysis shows that individuals fail
to minimize tax liabilities through retiming responses. Both groups
retime only 2%–3% of the contributions made just after age 70, lead-
ing to medium-term timing responses around 0.10. In addition, the
length of the horizon over which individuals are able to shift contri-
butions is limited. It is equal to 3 years for wealthy individuals and
1.5 years for standard individuals. Liquidity constraints can explain
part of the small timing responses and timing horizon. However,
timing responses and horizon of tax planning are still limited for
individuals who are not subject to liquidity constraints. Such ﬁndings
do not seem consistent with forward-looking individuals’ decisions
and could be better explained by the presence of myopia.

3.2. Real and shifting responses: difference-in-differences approach

3.2.1. Empirical methodology and identiﬁcation

Apart from timing responses, the preferential tax scheme for
Assurance-vie can also generate real and shifting responses. In order
to investigate these effects, we exploit the fact that the tax change
implemented in 1992 is not retroactive. Therefore, accounts opened
before 11/20/1991 are not subject to taxation change after age 70.
They can then constitute a proper counterfactual to those opened
after the implementation of the reform in a difference-in-differences
approach. Unfortunately, we only observe contributions made from
2003 to 2013, i.e. at least 12 years after accounts had been opened.
To avoid comparability issues, we restrain our sample to accounts
opened up to two years before or after the implementation of the
reform.

Fig. 4 compares the normalized log contributions and log account
balances by quarterly age coming from accounts opened just two
years before or after the 1992 reform. Both series display similar
trend leading up to age 70 and then begin to diverge.34 Contribu-
tions from the control group remain almost constant after 70 years
old, whereas those from the treated group decrease continuously.
While account balances increase at the same rate before age 70, the
increase is less pronounced for the treated group after age 70.35

We now address three potential concerns with our approach.
First, our sample includes only accounts (a) not terminated before
2003, and (b) not terminated during lifetime between 2003 and
2013. If the reform of 1992 is likely to play on (a) or (b), then our esti-
mation will suffer from selection bias. More speciﬁcally, the reform
may have increased the probability to terminate the accounts opened
after 11/20/1991 during lifetime, while they would have been trans-
mitted at death in absence of the reform. We argue that it should not
be the case, because these accounts still beneﬁt from a supplemen-
tal tax exemption of 30,000 euros and a complete exemption of the

33 With an account balance between 100,000 euros and 700,000 euros, these indi-
viduals belong to the top 10–1 % wealth group for elderly French population.
34 Note that there is no bunching around age 70 for the treated group. Indeed, bunch-
ing around age 70 occurs mainly during the ﬁrst few years after the date of account
opening. In contrast, Fig. 4 depicts contributions made between 2003 and 2013, i.e.
10 to 20 years after the assurance-vie accounts were opened. Online Appendix Fig. 11
shows contributions made between 2003–2013 by quarterly age, depending on the
opening date of the accounts.
35 As robustness checks, online Appendix Fig. 12.A and B depict the evolution of
contributions in falsiﬁcation experiments, in which control and treatment groups are
either both affected or both unaffected by the taxation change at age 70. In these falsi-
ﬁcation experiments, both series display parallel trends during lifetime and show no
divergence at age 70.

B) AVERAGE ACCOUNT BALANCES (INLOG) BY QUARTERLY AGE

Fig. 4.
Impact of inheritance tax on wealth accumulation: Difference-in-differences
evidence. Notes: The ﬁgure shows the normalized average log of (contributions + 1)
and the normalized average log of (account balances + 1) by quarterly age in the
control and treatment group. The normalization consists in subtracting to each aver-
age log of contributions/account balances of a given quarterly age, the average log
of contributions/account balances between 60 and 70 years old. Contributions from
accounts opened after 11/20/1991 (treatment group) encounter a sharp increase
in taxation after age 70, while contributions coming from accounts opened before
11/20/1991 (control group) are not affected by the tax reform. The corresponding
elasticity estimates are reported (see Table 9).

capitalized interests. The reform should only play on the supplemen-
tal contributions made after age 70 and above the tax exemption.
Therefore, the reform should not affect the probability to terminate
the account.

Second, individuals could anticipate the reform by opening an
account just before its implementation. In this case, the assignment
in the treated or control group would no longer be considered as
exogenous, and the estimation would be biased. This latter point,
however, should not be a concern in our analysis. The 1992 reform
was applied to Assurance-vie accounts opened after 11/20/1991, i.e.
40 days before the law was voted, in order to avoid this kind of
behavior.

Formally, we can test the presence of selection bias using the fol-
lowing intuition. If the treatment selection based on the 1992 reform
is not exogenous, we should expect the number of accounts opened
after the reform to be much less important than those opened before

the reform. In contrast, online Appendix Fig. 8 exhibits no difference
in the number of accounts coming from both groups.36

Finally, a difference-in-differences design is usually imple-
mentable when a sharp and unexpected change affects one out of
two groups that would evolve similarly in absence of the change.
That is not the case in our framework. The policy change was imple-
mented in 1992, implying that individuals from the treatment group
are aware of the tax scheme they face before and after age 70 through-
out the studied period (2003–2013). In a classical life-cycle model
with bequest motives, forward-looking individuals should therefore
plan ahead and adjust both their contributions made before and after
age 70, invalidating the use of a difference-in-differences approach.
However, Fig. 4 shows that they don’t. The evolutions of contribu-
tions and account balances before age 70 are similar between groups.
These ﬁndings are therefore not consistent with forward-looking
individuals’ decisions and could be better explained by the presence
of myopia in a peculiar model with people aware and responsive to
current tax rates but not to future expected tax rates. In this partic-
ular context, a difference-in-differences design makes sense. Indeed,
myopic individuals unable to respond to future expected tax changes
should behave exactly as individuals unaware of future tax changes.
Formally, we can quantify the impact of the inheritance tax
change on Assurance-vie accumulation using regression speciﬁca-
tions of the form:
log(yiagt + 1) = d • log(1 − tga) + bg + ca + mt + eia

(4)

log(yiagt + 1) = d • log(1 − tga) + ai + ca + mt + eia

(5)

where the dependent variable is either contributions or account
balances (in log)37 of individual i of age a from group g at time t. ai,
bg, ca and mt are respectively individual, group, age, and year ﬁxed
effects. The treatment group is deﬁned as individuals with accounts
opened up to two years after 11/20/1991, and the control group is
deﬁned as individuals with accounts opened up to two years before
11/20/1991. tga is the top marginal tax rate faced by individuals from
group g at age a. Consistent with the reform of the preferential tax
scheme, it is equal to 40% for individuals from the treated group
aged more than 70 years old and 20% otherwise. d represents the
difference-in-differences elasticity estimate. In Eq. (5), group ﬁxed
effects are substituted by individual ﬁxed effects to fully exploit the
longitudinal dimension of our data set.

3.2.2. Results
3.2.2.1. Regression estimates. Table 9 summarizes the graphical evi-
dence described above by presenting elasticity estimates. All esti-
mates are derived from Eqs. (4) and (5) using as dependent variable
either contributions (Panel A) or account balances (Panel B).

Column 2 reports the elasticity estimates from Eq. (4), while
column 1 omits year ﬁxed effects. The estimated elasticities are
essentially the same in both speciﬁcations: around 0.32 for contribu-
tions and 0.38 for account balances. Time is indeed irrelevant in our

36 In addition, online Appendix Fig. 9 shows that the density distributions are simi-
lar between groups. Online Appendix Fig. 10 depicts survival rates by age of account
owner in 2003 and treatment status over the 2003–2013 period. It shows that attrition
is slightly more pronounced in the treated group but the differences remain limited.
37 Note that we add one euro to each individual-level contribution/account balance
in order to include zeros in the analysis. Indeed, dropping them could bias downward
the results. The jump in taxation after age 70 decreases the incentives of individu-
als from the treated group to make contributions after age 70, while it is not the case
for the control group. Dropping zero contributions could artiﬁcially increase the aver-
age level of contributions made by the treated group after age 70 and could strongly
reduce the estimated elasticity. As a sensitivity analysis, we have also added two
euros (instead of one euro) to each contribution/account balance and the results are
unchanged (see online Appendix Table 17).

Note: The table displays elasticity estimates of the impact of the 1992 inheritance tax reform on Assurance-vie accumulation. The estimates are based on Eqs. (4) and (5). The
control group corresponds to accounts opened just before the tax reform (between 11/20/1989 and 11/20/1991). The treated group corresponds to accounts opened just after the
tax reform (between 11/20/1991 and 11/20/1993). For contributions made by the treatment group after 70 years old, top marginal tax rate goes from 20 % to 40 %, while it remains
constant at 20 % for the control group. Speciﬁcation 3 controls for differential preexisting age trends speciﬁc to control and treatment groups. It includes a “placebo” treatment
variable for the ﬁve-year period before the increase in taxation at age 70. In column 4, individual ﬁxed effects are substituted to group ﬁxed effects. Speciﬁcation 5 investigates
equal dynamic effects. The elasticity is broken down into medium- and long-term elasticities. Medium term refers to 0 to 5 years before age 80 (death), and long term equals 5 to
10 years before age 80. Column 6 reports the same elasticity as in column 4, but a block-bootstrap method at the individual level with 200 replications is used to derived standard
errors.

framework, because the tax change depends only on age and opening
date of the account.38

Our estimates should only be biased if both groups follow differ-
ent age trends before the tax change. Speciﬁcation 3 investigates a
potential difference in preexisting trends between the treatment and
control groups. In this speciﬁcation, we introduced a “placebo” treat-
ment variable for the ﬁve-year period before the increase in taxation
at age 70. The placebo elasticities are small (0.068 for contributions
and 0.109 for account balances) and not statistically signiﬁcant. The
real treatment elasticities are almost unchanged, and the change is
not statistically signiﬁcant.

Speciﬁcation 4 tests the robustness of the elasticities to the intro-
duction of individual ﬁxed effects (Eq. (5)), while Speciﬁcation 5
investigates dynamic effects of the tax change by splitting the post-
treatment period into a long-term horizon (70–75 years old) and a
medium-term horizon (75–80 years old).39 These speciﬁcations are
the most reliable and constitute our baseline speciﬁcations from
now on. For contributions (Panel A), the average elasticity decreases
slightly to 0.25 and remains statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level. The
medium-term elasticity (0.36) is statistically more important than
the long-term elasticity (0.23).40 For account balances (Panel B), the
elasticity between 70 and 75 years old is small (0.10) and barely sig-
niﬁcant. In contrast, the elasticity after age 75 is around 0.29 and
statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level. This difference can be explained

38 Adding interacted age-year or group-year ﬁxed effects also has no impact on
elasticity estimates.
39 As life expectancy is approximately equal to80 years,the mediumtermcorresponds
to 5 years before death, and the long term corresponds to 5–10 years before death.
40 Medium- and long-term elasticities are statistically signiﬁcant from each other
at the 5% level.

easily. The elasticity of account balances reﬂects the cumulative effect
of the reduction in contributions and associated earnings on the stock
of Assurance-vie accounts. As the tax change occurs at age 70, the total
reduction of contributions just after age 70 represents only a small
proportion of account balances. As people get older, the total reduc-
tion of contributions and associated earnings constitutes a growing
proportion of the stock of account. Moreover, this effect is ampliﬁed
by the fact that the reduction of contributions increases with age. Con-
sequently, the elasticity of account balances increases continuously
when people get older and is equal to 0.29 after age 75.

Following the inﬂuential paper of Bertrand et al. (2004), column 6
tests the potential bias of the standard errors. The elasticity reported
in column 6 is identical to that reported in column 4, but a block-
bootstrap method at the individual level is used to derive standard
errors. The bootstrap standard errors are similar to the clustered stan-
dard errors. As noted by Bertrand et al. (2004), clustering performs
well when the number of clusters is large.

Taken together, these results show that elasticities are small (0.25–
0.35) and precisely estimated. The small magnitude of elasticities can
be explained by the fact that despite a huge increase in taxation at age
70, the tax change has only induced a reduction of contributions of 7 %.
The elasticities reﬂect the aggregate effect of two different types of
responses: (i) a substitution of Assurance-vie for other assets (shift-
ing among asset portfolio), and (ii) a substitution of Assurance-vie
for consumption (wealth disaccumulation). Our estimated elastici-
ties should be seen as an upper bound of the true elasticity of taxable
estate. If 100% of the estimated elasticity was due to real responses,
our estimated elasticity would be similar to the elasticity of taxable
estate. However, a part of the estimated elasticity is due to shift-
ing responses. As shifting responses do not affect the overall level
of wealth, this part of the elasticity should not matter. Ideally, one

Note: The table presents various robustness checks. Column 1 reproduces the baseline elasticity (column 4 from Table 9). For the baseline speciﬁcation, the difference-in-

should compare the evolution of wealth composition in both groups
in order to disentangle the shifting and real components of the elas-
ticity. Unfortunately, our data set includes only the share of wealth
dedicated to Assurance-vie.

3.2.2.2. Robustness checks. Table 10 considers various robustness
checks. Column 1 reproduces our baseline estimate (column 4 from
Table 9).

In speciﬁcations 2 and 3, we consider alternative control groups.
In speciﬁcation 2, we select accounts opened between 11/20/1987
and 11/20/1989 as control group, i.e. 2 to 4 years before the imple-
mentation of the tax reform (instead of 0 to 2 years in the baseline
speciﬁcation). The elasticity increases moderately from 0.25 to 0.39.
As the alternative control group is a poorer substitute to the baseline
control group, it is less likely to reﬂect the evolution of the treat-
ment group in absence of the tax change. However, elasticity from
column 2 is very close to that obtained in the baseline speciﬁcation.
In speciﬁcation 3, we conduct “falsiﬁcation experiments” in which
the control group is also affected by the tax change at age 70, i.e.
accounts opened 2 to 4 years after the implementation of the tax
reform (instead of 0 to 2 years before in the baseline speciﬁcation). In
this new setting, both groups encounter exactly the same change in
taxation at 70 years old. Consistent with this framework, the placebo
elasticity is small (0.09) and insigniﬁcant.

In speciﬁcations 4 and 5, we carry out a sensitivity analysis with
respect to the window width used to select the sample. Speciﬁcation
4 reports the elasticity estimate for a “±1 year” window (accounts
opened one year before or after the implementation of the 1992
reform). Speciﬁcation 5 is based on a “±4 year” window. Broadly
speaking, the results are robust to the window width used. All elas-
ticities are very similar. Elasticity from speciﬁcation 5, however, is
less signiﬁcant due to the smaller size of the sample.

3.3. Discussion

The analysis of behavioral responses to inheritance tax yields ﬁve
main results. First, all elasticities are moderate, although they are
precisely estimated and robust to various robustness checks. Second,
timing responses around aged 70 are small (around 0.1), and the
horizon over which people are able to shift contributions is limited
(1.5 to 3 years). Third, the small magnitude of timing responses cannot
be explained by tax salience. Fourth, real and shifting responses are
more important than timing responses but remain limited around
0.25–0.35. Finally, real and shifting responses increase signiﬁcantly
when individuals get closer to death.

Our empirical ﬁndings shed new light on motivations behind
wealth accumulation and bequest motives. Poterba (2001) and
Joulfaian and McGarry (2004) (among others) have shown that gifts
appear to be signiﬁcantly underutilized as a tax planning tool, while
Kopczuk (2007) documented tax-motivated actions at the onset of a
terminal illness. Kopczuk (2007) argues that these ﬁndings could be
explained by two possible factors: a) “people do care about bequests
but they attach value to holding on to their wealth” or b) “procras-
tination in planning for behavioral reasons such as the diﬃculty of
acknowledging own mortality until it no longer can be denied”. Our
analysis provides a way of testing to what extent these two alternative
explanations are supported by our empirical evidence.

While our results are fully consistent with those highlighted by
previous literature, they cannot be explained by the desire to retain
control over wealth up to death (a). As for gifts, we ﬁnd that individu-
als fail to fully use Assurance-vie as a planning tool. Indeed, we show
that timing responses and the horizon of tax planning are limited.
We also document an increasing elasticity over age, which is consis-
tent with the fact that people care more about the disposition of their
estate when closer to death. However, these ﬁndings could not be
explained by a desire of individuals to hold on to their wealth while
alive. Assurance-vie is a very ﬂexible ﬁnancial asset that allows indi-
viduals to make unlimited contributions/withdrawals at any time
and therefore to retain total control over assets while alive.41

Our ﬁndings could be consistent with procrastination in planning
(b) induced bybehavioral reasonssuch as“denial of death”and myopia
for several reasons. First, both timing responses and the horizon over
which people are able to shift contributions are limited. These ﬁnd-
ings are due neither to salience of tax nor to liquidity constraints42.
In contrast, they are consistent with the presence of procrastination
in planning. Second, while individuals are aware of taxation changes
at age 70 and therefore could plan ahead, Fig. 4 shows that they don’t.
These ﬁndings are therefore not consistent with forward-looking
individuals’ decisions and could be better explained by the presence
of myopia. Third, real and shifting responses increase signiﬁcantly
when individuals get older and therefore closer to death. This is fully
consistent with the fact that tax planning tools and more generally

41 Preference for lifetime wealth retention, ‘rotten kid theorem,’ or uncertainty about
death are all irrelevant in our framework, because Assurance-vie remains part of
individuals’ wealth and can be cashed out at any time without cost.
42 Both timing responses and horizon of tax planning remain limited when restricting
our sample to individuals with accounts between 100,000 euros and 700,000 euros
(Panel B of Table 8).

bequest remind people of death, which is associated to a painful event.
They will therefore avoid dealing with death and inheritance until
an advanced age. When individuals get closer to death, they progres-
sively accept the idea of contemplating death and are more prompt
to transmit their wealth and react to inheritance tax. Let us under-
line that our ﬁndings do not provide direct evidence pointing to the
existence of psychological factors and that this question remains a
promising avenue for future research.

4. Conclusion

Our article has analyzed the effect of inheritance taxation on
different components of behavioral responses in an inter-temporal
framework. This study has beneﬁted from ﬁrst-time access to a
unique longitudinal data set from the ﬁnancial company AXA. Our
empirical strategy exploits quasi-experimental variation created by
the French preferential tax scheme for wealth transmission through
Assurance-vie account. This scheme offers an opportunity to credibly
disentangle timing responses from other responses such as shifting
among tax base and wealth disaccumulation directly during lifetime,
rather than relying solely on observations at death.

Our empirical ﬁndings shed new light on motivations behind
wealth accumulation and bequest motives. Although our ﬁndings are
consistent with those from the literature, our interpretation differs.
Indeed, we show that our results cannot be supported by the desire
to retain control over wealth. We also show that our results cannot
be explained by an absence of tax salience and are not consistent
with forward-looking individuals’ decisions. Although our ﬁndings
may be consistent with the existence of psychological biases such as
myopia and denial of death, this question remains open and is left for
future research.
