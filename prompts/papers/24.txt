We study cross-subsidization among U.S. equity products managed by institutional asset
management ﬁrms. We ﬁnd returns-based evidence consistent with both cross-subsidization
receipt by strong recent performers that are relatively small in their ﬁrms and provision by
products that are relatively large in their ﬁrms. Tax-exempt investors and taxable investors
do not have a clear ranking by expertise, but tax-exempt investors’ agency issues are more
complex.Accordingly, taxable clients have more ﬂow-performance nonlinearity and receive
more (and provide less) cross-subsidization. Taxable investor ﬂows appear more discerning,
but only under the circumstances conducive to cross-subsidization, suggesting that “more
discerning” likely means “more cross-subsidized.” (JEL G23)

In this paper, we study patterns of investment managers’ product returns
consistent with cross-subsidization of performance among multiple investment
products from the same ﬁrm. We focus on institutional asset management ﬁrms,

Cross-Subsidization in Institutional Asset Management Firms

one of the two traditional means of delivering asset management services.1
Institutional asset management ﬁrms are the primary investment managers
for tax-exempt institutional clients such as government and corporate pension
plans, endowments, and foundations, as well as for taxable clientele consisting
largely of high net-worth individuals. Their prevalent investment product
is a separately managed account. A client’s portfolio is managed according
to a certain investment style, portfolios managed in a particular style—
though managed separately—are grouped into a product, and the product’s
performance is reported as the asset-weighted performance of the constituent
portfolios.

Recent literature has documented cross-subsidization within mutual-fund
companies (Gaspar, Massa, and Matos 2006; Bhattacharya, Lee, and Pool
2013; Casavecchia and Tiwari 2016).2 Both institutional asset management
ﬁrms and mutual-fund companies have family organizational forms, assess
fees based on assets under management, and have ﬂow-performance relations
that reward recent strong performance with disproportionate ﬂows. These
circumstances yield a mismatch between investors’ desire for maximization
of product performance and ﬁrms’ desire for maximization of assets under
management that creates incentives for cross-subsidization. However, evidence
of cross-subsidization in mutual-fund companies does not necessarily imply its
prevalence in institutional asset management ﬁrms because typical investors in
the two investment channels possess different levels of ﬁnancial sophistication
and deploy different processes to identify and monitor managers. Plan sponsors
investing through institutional asset management ﬁrms seek investment options
in elaborate, multistage search processes (Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny
1992; Goyal and Wahal 2008). Those involved in the process have, on average,
higher levels of ﬁnancial expertise than retail investors do. Moreover, plan
sponsors often hire consultants, presumably to enhance their level of expertise
even further.3

Aside from not being portable to the domain of institutional asset
management ﬁrms, the results pertaining to cross-subsidization within mutual-
fund families are not as rich. Indeed, as we outline below in more detail,
simultaneous presence of two clienteles with comparable levels of ﬁnancial
sophistication, yet with differential levels of agency issues leads to testable

1 This paper focuses on traditional, long-only U.S. equity asset managers in institutional asset management
ﬁrms, charging fees based on assets under management. Therefore, we do not consider alternative investments
compensated primarily from management and performance fees, such as hedge funds, private equity, and venture
capital ﬁrms.

2 Mutual-fund companies are the registered investment companies regulated by the 1940 Investment Company
Act. They are the primary investment channel for retail investors, offering well-diversiﬁed investment vehicles
(open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and unit-investment trusts).

3 Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992) argue that consultants are hired as much for enhancing the level of
expertise as for creating an avenue for the plan sponsors to shift the blame in case of future underperformance.
Goyal and Wahal (2008) report consultant involvement in around 60% of the hiring decisions by various pension
plans, endowments, and foundations.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 31 n 2 2018

predications that not only link incentives for cross-subsidization (captured by
the ﬂow-performance relation) and the extent of cross-subsidization, but also
provide highly suggestive evidence that what may appear as skill in identifying a
talented manager could instead reﬂect a different skill, that is, skill in identifying
a manager willing to provide cross-subsidization.

Sialm, Starks, and Zhang (2015) ﬁnd that mutual-fund ﬂows by deﬁned-
contribution plans (featuring elaborate search processes, often with both
in-house and outside expertise) do not predict future fund performance, while
mutual-fund ﬂows by other mutual-fund investors (featuring less elaborate
search processes and, on average, lower levels of ﬁnancial expertise) predict
future performance negatively. This gap characterizes deﬁned-contribution
plans (henceforth DC plans) as more discerning than other mutual-fund
investors and provides prima facie evidence of the relevance of ﬁnancial
sophistication and elaborate investment selection processes for the investment
outcome. Similar to DC plans investing through mutual funds, clients investing
through institutional asset management ﬁrms bring high levels of ﬁnancial
sophistication into the process.

Moreover, compared to DC plans investing through mutual funds, let
alone retail mutual-fund investors,
institutional clients investing through
separately managed accounts in institutional asset management ﬁrms have a
far higher level of access to the information about their accounts. Because
they own the securities in their accounts and are large investors, management
is very responsive to requests for account information, including portfolio
composition, trades made in their account (including the rationale for those
trades), and prices at which those trades were made. Therefore, clients
investing through institutional asset management ﬁrms are more likely than
those investing through mutual-fund companies to detect potential cross-
subsidization patterns in which their accounts might be the ones providing
it (and thereby experiencing a performance decline). Presumably, the ease
with which these investors could ﬁre the manager and transfer their account
with minimum friction to another manager might deter, or at least mitigate,
cross-subsidization practices. Accordingly, we focus our ﬁrst set of analyses
on gauging the extent of cross-subsidization in institutional asset management
ﬁrms.

Given the access to information and the clients’ average level of
ﬁnancial sophistication, provision of cross-subsidization in institutional asset
management ﬁrms needs to be subtle and difﬁcult to detect. A plausible
channel for such cross-subsidization is directed from a ﬁrm’s relatively large
products to its relatively small products because substantially enhancing the
performance of the latter requires a barely noticeable decline in the performance
of the former. For example, allocating a $1 million position in an asset that
experiences a 100% return to a $100 million portfolio instead of allocating
it to a $1 billion portfolio would enhance the performance of the former by
1%, while diminishing the performance of the latter by only 10 basis points

(bps). Generally, cross-subsidization may be implemented through strategic
cross-trading (Casavecchia and Tiwari 2016), preferential initial public offering
(IPO) allocation (Gaspar, Massa, and Matos 2006), preferential allocation of
investment ideas, and favoritism in trade allocation (Ben-Rephael and Israelsen
2017).

A unique database free of survivorship bias, backﬁlling bias, and revision
bias enables us to focus on U.S. equity products managed by institutional asset
management ﬁrms. Using difference-in-differences estimation, we ﬁnd that
recent strong performers (high-value products in terms of attracting investment
ﬂows both to themselves and to the other products in the same ﬁrm) whose
assets under management are relatively small among their respective ﬁrms’
domestic equity products exhibit a pattern of returns consistent with receiving
a cross-subsidization of 1.70% per year. We also ﬁnd complementary evidence
consistent with cross-subsidization provision by showing that the products
with large assets under management relative to other domestic equity products
managed by the same ﬁrm experience a performance decline of −0.64% per
year if in the previous year there had been a strong domestic equity performer—
a high-value product and, as such, a desirable recipient of cross-subsidization
in the current year—elsewhere in the ﬁrm.

We proceed by exploiting the importance of the 3-year performance horizon
(commonly used by clients to evaluate products). We ﬁnd further evidence
consistent with cross-subsidization by showing that a relatively small product
is cross-subsidized in month t if the product’s return in month t– 36 had been
very strong (but will drop out of the 3-year performance record by the end of
month t), with a particularly strong effect if month t is December, associated
with the highest, end-of-year investor attention. This evidence, compelling in
its own right, also suggests very strongly that, because asset management ﬁrms
simply do not allocate talent or resources for only a month, our main ﬁndings of
cross-subsidization receipt and provision could not be generated only through
some form of implicit outcome distortion such as reallocation of managerial
talent or resources within the ﬁrm.

The second part of the paper deepens the study of cross-subsidization in
institutional asset-management ﬁrms by taking advantage of the rich setting
that features clientele heterogeneity. The mutual-fund clientele landscape
of ﬁnancial sophistication is clear-cut. DC plans investing in mutual funds
are more ﬁnancially sophisticated than other, mostly retail mutual-fund
investors. By contrast, it is unclear whether the expertise of plan sponsors
and consultants selecting investment options for tax-exempt clients (pension
plans, endowments, and foundations) exceeds the expertise of wealth managers
selecting investment options for taxable clients (mostly high net-worth
individuals).

The key identifying wedge between the tax-exempt and taxable clients
investing through institutional asset management ﬁrms is the differential
presence of agency issues that permeate the processes of selecting, monitoring,

and changing investment options. In contrast to taxable clients (predominantly
high net-worth individuals), plans sponsors acting on behalf of various tax-
exempt clients are not the ultimate beneﬁciaries (Lakonishok, Shleifer, and
Vishny 1992; Goyal and Wahal 2008). Rather, the beneﬁciaries of pension
plans are government or corporate employees and retirees, the beneﬁciaries
of endowments are universities and other institutions, and so on. Therefore,
on average, the process employed by taxable clients has fewer layers and is
both simpler and less burdened by agency issues and frictions than the process
employed by tax-exempt institutional clients.

The differential search process complexity and the associated agency issues
predict that taxable clients should be less encumbered and, therefore, positioned
to chase winners and drop losers to a higher extent than tax-exempt clients.
We conﬁrm this hypothesis by showing that the nonlinearity of the ﬂow-
performance relation is more pronounced for taxable clients than for tax-exempt
clients.4 The greater elasticity and convexity of taxable ﬂow suggest higher
marginal beneﬁts to cross-subsidization and, therefore, predicts more cross-
subsidization toward, and less cross-subsidization away from, taxable clients.
We conﬁrm this prediction by showing that cross-subsidization toward taxable
products is more than twice as intense as it is toward tax-exempt products
(2.41% vs. 1.02% per year). Moreover, cross-subsidization away from tax-
exempt products is −0.78% per year, whereas cross-subsidization away from
taxable products is statistically indistinguishable from zero.

These ﬁndings suggest that identifying an investment option likely to
generate superior returns need not only mean identifying a talented manager, but
may also mean identifying a setting in which the institutional asset management
ﬁrm is willing to enhance product performance by cross-subsidizing it. Such
a circumstance could lead the econometrician to conclude that taxable clients
are more discerning than tax-exempt clients, despite the absence of a clear
prediction of their differential average ﬁnancial sophistication. Relying on a test
from Sialm, Starks, and Zhang (2015), we conﬁrm this prediction by showing
that investment ﬂows by the tax-exempt clients are worse predictors of product
investment performance than investment ﬂows by the taxable clients, making
the latter more discerning in the parlance of Sialm, Starks, and Zhang (2015).
Finally, we develop a careful matching between investment performance
of taxable dollar ﬂows and investment performance of highly comparable
tax-exempt ﬂows to explore whether the differential success the investment
ﬂows generated by the two clienteles have in predicting product performance

4 Sialm, Starks, and Zhang (2015) show that mutual-fund DC assets have a steeper ﬂow-performance relation
than non-DC, directly-held assets do. This result may seem surprising because plan participants rarely review
and alter their retirement investment choices in DC plans (e.g., Benartzi and Thaler 2001; Carroll et al. 2009).
Sialm, Starks, and Zhang (2015) use of a detailed data set of plan participants’ allocations within their respective
plan options, also used in Pool, Sialm, and Stefanescu (2016), to show that sensitivity of DC plan asset ﬂows to
past performance comes from plan sponsors (who review retirement plan option choices and periodically revise
them by adding or dropping some mutual funds from the plan’s investment options menu), rather than from plan
participants (whose ﬂow-performance sensitivity indeed is practically ﬂat by comparison).

Cross-Subsidization in Institutional Asset Management Firms

stems from taxable investors’ superior acumen to pick investment managers or,
alternatively, from a more pronounced cross-subsidization effort institutional
asset management ﬁrms extend toward taxable clients. First, we group product-
year observations into 20 bins, deﬁned by quartiles of products’ relative size
and quintiles of products’ adjusted performance. Second, within each bin we
calculate for each observation the difference between adjusted returns of a
product featuring a certain taxable dollar ﬂow and its matched product pursuing
the same investment objective from a different ﬁrm and featuring a comparable
tax-exempt dollar ﬂow.

If “more discerning” translates into superior investment acumen, the dollar
commitments made by taxable clients would be rather uniformly “smarter”
across the 20 bins than the comparable dollar commitments made by tax-
exempt clients into investment opportunities matched along relevant observable
dimensions. By contrast, we ﬁnd that by far the largest gap of 1.14% per year,
signiﬁcant at the 5% level, is present in the bin of relatively small products
with the past product performance in the top quintile, consistent with a very
pronounced role of cross-subsidization. The two next highest performance
gaps, around 0.8% per year and both statistically signiﬁcant at the 10% level,
are positioned in the two bins adjacent to the “winning” relatively small,
top past performance bin, whereas none of the remaining 17 bins yielded a
performance gap that is nearly as large in magnitude, let alone statistically
signiﬁcant. Therefore, in the domain of institutional asset management ﬁrms,
“more discerning” very likely means “more intensely cross-subsidized.”

1. Data Sources, Sample Overview, and Summary Statistics

Our key data come from 59 quarterly releases of data concerning institutional
asset management ﬁrms for the period from June 1993 to December 2007
(obtained from the Mobius Group and, from September 2006 onward, from
Informa Investment Solutions (IIS) PSN Data Select).5 Both data sources
have been used by institutional clients to identify money managers, study
their track records, and consider a range of other variables relevant for their
investment decision-making processes.6 The 59 quarterly releases enabled
us to construct a data set free of survivorship bias, backﬁlling bias, and
revision bias. The data feature product returns (computed as asset-weighted
averages across all portfolios managed within the product and reported net

5 Upon subsuming the Mobius Group and the immediate subsequent expiration of rolling 1-year agreements with
Mobius clients, Informa Investment Solutions (IIS) began applying its own pricing and distribution model based
on continuous data feed (rather than quarterly database distribution through CD/DVD media) at competitive
prices, making continued subscription to the data prohibitively costly. Ultimately, December 2007 was the last
data installment IIS was willing to provide under the earlier pricing and distribution scheme.

6 Literature on institutional asset management uses Informa Investment Solutions (Busse, Goyal, and Wahal 2010;
Berzins, Liu, and Trzcinka 2013) or a comparable data source (Mercer’s Manager Performance Analytics; Goyal
and Wahal 2008).

of trading costs, but gross of investment management fees), products’ ﬁrm
afﬁliation, investment objective, and assets under management (total assets
and, for most observations, a breakdown into taxable and tax-exempt assets).7
Because most variables are available with annual frequency, most of our
analyses extend over annual performance horizons. For some analyses, we use
investment style benchmarks from Russell. Our sample consists of all domestic-
equity product-year observations that have the requisite variables for our
analyses.

Table 1 presents the basic summary statistics regarding the number of
institutional asset management ﬁrms with domestic equity products, number of
domestic equity products, ﬁrm domestic equity assets, domestic equity product
assets, and average number of domestic equity products per ﬁrm. The table
reports year-end summaries from 1992 to 2006 (the analyses explore 1-year
returns following the snapshots displayed in this table, thus making 2006 the
last year for which the data concerning product returns are available over the
next year, till the end of 2007). As shown in Table 1, during the sample period
about 300 to 400 institutional asset management ﬁrms managed domestic equity
products each year, with about ﬁve to fourteen billion dollars in domestic equity
assets per ﬁrm on average. There were about 1,300 to 2,600 domestic equity
products each year, with average assets under management between one and
two billion dollars. Throughout the sample period, on average, ﬁrms managed
about 5 to 6 domestic equity products.

Table 2 shows summary statistics for the key variables in our empirical
analyses. Product i’s adjusted return during year t, ARi,t, is calculated by
subtracting from Ri,t (product i’s return in year t, calculated net of transaction
costs but gross of fees) the median annual return to a product pursuing the
same investment style in the same year, in the same asset-size quartile (across
all products other than those from product i’s ﬁrm). Measuring performance
relative to other products that pursue the same investment objective and have
similar assets under management addresses the potential concern that merely
using the controls for product assets under management may not sufﬁce to
control for size effects and, therefore, ensures that a mechanical, negative
relation between product performance and product asset size (e.g., Chen et al.
2004; Pollet and Wilson 2008) cannot drive any of our results.

The table next features summary statistics regarding product assets Assetsi,t,
both for overall products and for their taxable and tax-exempt clienteles,
within-product breakdown of taxable and tax-exempt assets (captured by
the variable %TaxableAssetsi,t), and product i’s ﬁrm’s domestic-equity assets

7 The data set also contains some coverage of the products’ fee schedules. Fees need not be disclosed, and 46.5% of
all the sample observations miss them. Also, fees are paid on a per client basis, and institutional asset management
ﬁrms can charge different fees to different investors in the same product. Moreover, anecdotally, fees may be
discounted from the schedule, especially for clients with bargaining power, none of which is observable in
the data. These considerations preclude the analyses of cross-subsidization based on high fees as a measure of
products’ high value to their ﬁrms.

This table provides basic sample summary statistics for institutional asset management ﬁrms’ domestic equity
investments. The data set is compiled from 59 quarterly releases of data concerning institutional asset managers
(obtained from the Mobius Group and, from September 2006 onward, Informa Investment Solutions (IIS) PSN
Data Select) in the period from June 1993 to December 2007. The table reports year-end summaries from
1992 to 2006 (the analyses explore 1-year returns following the snapshots displayed in this table, thus making
2006 the last year for which the data concerning product returns are available over the next year, till the end
of 2007).

FirmDEAssetsi,t. Taxable assets have a signiﬁcant presence; they constitute
38% of the overall investment through institutional asset management ﬁrms.
Variability of product and ﬁrm assets is substantial, with the respective
interquartile ranges from $64 million to $1.1 billion (product assets)
and from $1.4 billion to $17 billion (ﬁrm domestic-equity assets). We
measure product i’s ﬂow during year t, Flowi,t, in a standard way, as
the change in assets from year t−1 to t divided by assets at the end of
year t−1, (Assetsi,t−(1+ Ri,t)·Assetsi,t−1)/Assetsi,t−1. TaxableFlowi,t, and
TaxExemptFlowi,t, are deﬁned analogously for the respective taxable and
tax-exempt ﬂows.

For each product-year observation, we deﬁne RelativeSizei,t as the ratio of
the product’s assets Assetsi,t and the average of the assets of all domestic-
equity products in the ﬁrm in year t (except for those of product i itself).
We use RelativeSizei,t to deﬁne two indicator variables for each product-year
observation. RelSmalli,t (indicating that assets under management by product
i in year t, Assetsi,t, are small relative to the average domestic-equity product
in the ﬁrm) is set to one if RelativeSizei,t is in the bottom quartile of the
cross-sectional distribution of relative sizes of all sample products in year t.
Analogously, RelBigi,t (indicating that assets under management by product i
in year t, Assetsi,t, are big relative to the average domestic-equity product in the
ﬁrm) is set to one if RelativeSizei,t is in the top quartile of the cross-sectional

distribution of relative sizes of all sample products in year t. Not surprisingly,
the relatively small domestic-equity products (those with RelSmalli,t = 1) are
much smaller than the relatively big domestic-equity products (those with
RelBigi,t = 1); average assets under management for the two groups are 101
million and 4.32 billion, respectively. Finally, we also document products’ age,
turnover, and expense ratio, with the latter two variables reported by only
50%–60% of all sample observations.

One of our analyses requires information regarding ﬁrms’ cross-trading
practices, obtained from the Security and Exchange Commission form ADV.
Registered investment advisors who manage $100 million of client money
or more must ﬁle the form with the SEC annually. A speciﬁc question from
form ADV inquires about ﬁrm cross-subsidization practices.8 The earliest
ADV forms we could obtain are for 2010, after the period covered in our
study (1992–2007). However, cross-trading practices are highly persistent and
their measurement in 2010 may introduce some noise, but no evident bias. An
additional consequence of the timing of the ADV forms available for these
analyses is that we lack observations associated with (the very few) ﬁrms that
have been around during the sample period, but have ceased to exist since.

Cross-Subsidization in Institutional Asset Management Firms

assess fees based on assets under management, and they both exhibit
ﬂow-performance relations that reward recent strong performance with
disproportionate ﬂows. These circumstances create incentives for cross-
subsidization because there is a mismatch between investors’ desire for
maximization of product performance and ﬁrms’ desire for maximization of
assets under management.

However, clients investing through mutual-fund companies and institutional
asset management ﬁrms differ along three important dimensions. First, on
average, the latter possess higher levels of ﬁnancial sophistication. Second,
they also deploy, on average, more elaborate and thorough processes to identify
and monitor managers. Third, compared to mutual-fund investors, institutional
clients investing through separately managed accounts in institutional asset
management ﬁrms have a far higher level of access to the information about
their accounts. These differences suggest that evidence of cross-subsidization
in mutual-fund companies (Gaspar, Massa, and Matos 2006; Bhattacharya, Lee,
and Pool 2013; Casavecchia and Tiwari 2016) does not necessarily imply its
prevalence in institutional asset management ﬁrms. Indeed, as discussed in the
introductory section, clients investing through institutional asset management
ﬁrms are better positioned than those investing through mutual-fund companies
to detect potential cross-subsidization patterns in which their accounts are the
ones providing it. The ease with which they could ﬁre the manager and transfer
their account with minimum friction to another manager might deter, or at least
mitigate, cross-subsidization practices. Accordingly, our baseline analyses seek
to gauge the extent of cross-subsidization in institutional asset management
ﬁrms.

Client access to account

information and average level of ﬁnancial
sophistication pose a challenge for institutional asset management ﬁrms looking
to arrange for provision of cross-subsidization. A plausible, subtle channel for
such cross-subsidization is directed from a ﬁrm’s relatively large products
to its relatively small products because, as discussed earlier, substantially
enhancing the performance of the latter requires a barely noticeable decline
in the performance of the former. The mutual-fund literature has argued
that cross-subsidization may be implemented through strategic cross-trading
(Casavecchia and Tiwari 2016), preferential IPO allocation (Gaspar, Massa, and
Matos 2006), preferential allocation of investment ideas, and favoritism in trade
allocation (Ben-Rephael and Israelsen 2017). Unfortunately, data limitations
largely preclude a direct test of cross subsidization in investment products
not subject to the disclosure requirements of the 1940 Investment Company
Act. However, we provide returns-based evidence that aligns well with our
predictions of differential incentives for, and costs of, cross-subsidization.
Although this evidence does not establish cross-subsidization conclusively, we
believe that the circumstantial evidence for cross-subsidization as the source
of the return patterns we document is overwhelming.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 31 n 2 2018

2.1 Performance analyses of relatively small and relatively

large products

We focus on U.S. equity products managed by the institutional asset
management ﬁrms. Using difference-in-differences estimation, we develop two
closely related tests that seek to identify patterns in returns consistent with
receipt and provision of cross-subsidization. The ﬁrst test relates products’
adjusted annual returns ARi,t+1 to indicator variables RelSmalli,t, Topi,t, and
their interaction RelSmalli,t×Topi,t, as well as a number of controls and effects:

ARi,t+1 = β0 RelSmalli,t + β1 Topi,t + β2 RelSmalli,t×Topi,t

+controls+effects+ εi,t+1.

(1)

The indicator variable Topi,t is set to one if return to product i in year t
had been ranked in the top quintile among all products pursuing the same
investment objective in year t as product i did, and is set to zero otherwise. The
key regression coefﬁcient in this speciﬁcation is the difference-in-differences
estimator β2, capturing the extent to which performance differential between
relatively small products (products with more resources for receiving cross-
subsidization) and other products (products with fewer resources for receiving
cross-subsidization) is different for past top performers than it is for past non-
top performers. A positive and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient β2, therefore,
would reﬂect performance enhancement among relatively small products tied
to strong past performance, documenting a pattern consistent with cross-
subsidization receipt. Controls are lagged adjusted product returns ARi,t (to
ensure that, in the spirit of Busse, Goyal, and Wahal (2010), we control for
performance persistence), product assets and ﬁrm domestic equity assets (both
in logarithmic form), as well as their squares. Effects include year-by-style
effects—to ensure that we are identifying effects among products with the
same year and style (rather than across years and styles)—and ﬁrm effects—
to also ensure that any variable varying only by ﬁrm is absorbed and cannot
explain our ﬁndings. These controls and effects are used in the vast majority
of our analyses. Finally, we calculate standard errors by clustering in a way
that allows for heteroskedasticity as well as correlation across observations
associated with the same ﬁrm.

Two key features of the speciﬁcation from Equation (1) ensure that it does
not merely reﬂect mechanically potential effects of performance persistence.
First, we explicitly control for lagged performance, thereby including a
standard approach toward controlling for persistence. Second, the difference-
in-differences feature of the speciﬁcation helps us discern whether any effects
we might uncover stem only from performance persistence, or whether cross-
subsidization plays a role too. In particular, the extent of persistence among
products that are not relatively small in their ﬁrms is reﬂected in the regression
coefﬁcient β1 (associated with variable Topi,t), which, together with past

product performance, captures the effects of performance persistence.9 If
performance persistence—to whatever extent it is present—were the only
thing going on in this setting, regression coefﬁcient β2 (associated with
the interaction RelSmalli,t×Topi,t) should be completely ﬂat, indicating that

the condition conducive to cross-subsidization of recent strong performers—
being relatively small within the ﬁrm—is not related to returns beyond the
extent already present through the regression coefﬁcient β1 (associated with
variable Topi,t). On the other hand, because there does not appear to be a
plausible reason why—aside from cross-subsidization—product returns should
be still higher among recent strong performers just because they are relatively
small in their ﬁrms (adjusted returns, our measure of product performance,
are benchmarked by investment style and assets under management), a
positive and statistically signiﬁcant regression coefﬁcient β2 (associated
with the interaction RelSmalli,t×Topi,t) should indeed constitute compelling

circumstantial evidence of cross-subsidization.

Its structure, controls, and effects correspond closely to those from Equation

equity product in the ﬁrm other than product i had been ranked in the top
quintile among all product pursuing the same investment objective in year t as
that product did, and is set to zero otherwise. The key regression coefﬁcient
in this speciﬁcation is the difference-in-differences estimator β2, capturing
the extent to which performance differential between relatively big products
(products with more resources for providing cross-subsidization) and other
products (products with fewer resources for providing cross-subsidization)
is different for products in ﬁrms that have had a past top performer than it
is for products in ﬁrms that have not had a past top performer. A positive

9 Performance persistence, to whatever extent it may be present, could stem from momentum effects embedded
in the returns of the underlying product portfolio securities, price pressures resulting from ﬂows of new money
into products following their recent strong performance, and managerial talent. Because we do not have holdings
data, we remain agnostic on the precise attribution of sources of potential performance persistence captured by
the indicator variable Topi,t .

and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient β2, therefore, would reﬂect performance
deterioration among relatively big products tied to strong past performance of
(an)other product(s) in the ﬁrm, documenting a pattern in returns consistent
with cross-subsidization provision.

Table 3 presents baseline regression estimates concerning cross-
subsidization receipt (Panel A) and cross-subsidization provision (Panel B),
based on Equations (1) and (2), respectively. Each panel has two columns,
with different product return adjustment benchmarks. The ﬁrst column
features adjustment carried out by subtracting from product annual returns
the contemporaneous return to the style benchmark deﬁned by the appropriate
Russell index. Such return adjustment, reported for completeness, corresponds
closely to the way the asset management industry and some of the academic
literature (e.g., Goyal and Wahal 2008) often view and report performance—
net of an investment benchmark characterizing the investment style. The
second column features the adjustment described in the previous section—
henceforth our primary approach—consisting of subtracting from product
annual returns the contemporaneous median return among all the products
(except for the products from product i’s ﬁrm) pursuing the same investment
style and belonging to the same asset-size quartile.

In Panel A, regression coefﬁcient estimates of β0 (labeled in the table as
RelSmalli,t) show the absence of a performance differential between relatively
small past non-top performers and other past non-top performers. Coefﬁcient
estimates of βl (labeled in the table as Topi,t) show that, among products that
are not relatively small, the performance differential between the products
that had been top performers and had not been top performers is around
1% per year (1.08% in the ﬁrst column and 0.98% in the second column),
reﬂecting the role of persistence.10 Finally, as discussed earlier, β2 (labeled
in the table as RelSmalli,t×Topi,t) reﬂects a pattern of returns consistent

with cross-subsidization receipt. Once again, the estimates are very similar
across the two columns of Panel A, ranging from 1.70% to 1.74% per year,
and are both statistically signiﬁcant.11 This magnitude, about 1.7% per year,

10 Lagged returns ARi,t , another control for performance persistence, do not play a discernible role. In unreported
results, we verify that the magnitude of the key regression coefﬁcient associated with RelSmalli,t ×Topi,t in a
speciﬁcation that omits ARi,t and is otherwise identical to the baseline speciﬁcation from the second column
of Panel A in Table 3 is little changed (1.619, SE = 0.518; statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level). Also, the
economic effect of ARi,t in the baseline speciﬁcation from the second column of Panel A in Table 3 is humble.
According to the summary statistics from Table 2, its interquartile range is 3.83−(−4.10)= 7.93%, implying from
the baseline speciﬁcation the marginal effect of −0.013×7.93%= 10 bps/year. This magnitude corresponds to
merely 0.1/1.695= 6% of the baseline effect (and only 17.9% of 0.559, the standard error of the estimate of the
baseline effect).

11 To alleviate the potential concern that this result spuriously arises from return persistence that might be limited
to, or more pronounced among, small products, in unreported analyses we replicate the baseline analysis from
the second column of Table 3, Panel A, on three subsamples, deﬁned by product size. All three coefﬁcients from
these analyses are statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels and are very similar to the baseline coefﬁcient
of 1.695. They are 1.514 for the bottom tercile of product sizes (products with assets under management below
$117 million), 1.726 for the middle tercile of product sizes, and 1.601 for the top tercile of product sizes (products
with asset under management above $704 million).

Cross-Subsidization in Institutional Asset Management Firms

amounts to about one-half of the cross-subsidization effect in the domain
of mutual funds: Gaspar, Massa, and Matos (2006) report their baseline
result indicating cross-subsidization of up to 3.3% per year, prevailing for
the speciﬁcations in which high (low) fund value is captured by recent high
(low) fund performance. That the magnitude of cross-subsidization is smaller
in institutional asset management ﬁrms than in mutual-fund ﬁrms is consistent
with the aforementioned possibility that the institutional asset management
clients investing in products positioned to provide cross-subsidization may
have been somewhat successful in deterring it, but not quite eliminating it.
×
In Panel B, as discussed earlier, β2 (labeled in the table as RelBigi,t
TopElsewhereInFirmi,t) reﬂects a pattern of returns consistent with cross-
subsidization provision. Like in Panel A, the estimates are very similar across
the two columns, ranging from –0.64% to –0.63% per year, and are both
statistically signiﬁcant. These results are compelling because our principal
benchmarking approach ensures that
the documented pattern of returns
consistent with cross-subsidization provision is not driven by a performance
differential between large products and small products (e.g., Chen et al. 2004;
Pollet and Wilson 2008). Moreover, any explanation of the documented relation
between a product’s performance drop and the past high performance of other
products in the ﬁrm that completely rules out cross-subsidization does not
appear plausible because the observed pattern cannot be mechanically related
to product return persistence, nor is there any known asset return anomaly or
pattern that would account for this ﬁnding.

2.2 Implicit or explicit performance allocation
The results from the previous section (Table 3) provide compelling returns-
based evidence consistent with cross-subsidization. An intriguing question
is how such cross-subsidization is achieved. In the settings in which either
portfolio composition or trade-level data are available, past research has
suggested that cross-subsidization may be implemented through strategic cross-
trading (Casavecchia and Tiwari 2016), preferential IPO allocation (Gaspar,
Massa, and Matos 2006; Bhattacharya, Lee, and Pool 2013), preferential
allocation of investment ideas, and favoritism in trade allocation (Ben-Rephael
and Israelsen 2017). In the absence of holdings and trade data, and in the light
of availability of extant results elsewhere in the literature, we do not engage
in a deeper study of these mechanisms (in the next subsection we do offer
suggestive evidence of the role of cross-trading, based on a broad, ﬁrm-level
self-declaration of cross-trading practices from ADV forms). For our purposes,
it will sufﬁce to lump all of these mechanisms under the rubric of explicit
outcome distortions and pose a novel question—whether it is plausible that the
results we document in the previous section stem from an implicit performance
allocation.

The speciﬁc implicit performance allocation we have in mind is that,
because managerial talent and effort within the ﬁrm are fungible, they may

This table displays regression coefﬁcient estimates from Equations (1) and (2), presented in Panels A and
B, respectively. In both regressions, the dependent variable is ARi,t+1, the style- and size-adjusted product
performance in year t +1. Sections 1 and 2 describe key independent variables, including RelSmalli,t , RelBigi,t ,
Topi,t , and TopElsewhereInFirmi,t . Controls include lagged adjusted product returns ARi,t , product assets, and
ﬁrm domestic equity assets (both in logarithmic form), as well as their squares. Effects include year x style effects
and ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity and dependence of

be strategically allocated across different products at different times. The
reluctance traditionally displayed by the institutional asset management ﬁrms
to disclose precise manager allocation across products creates room for
such a possibility.12 In principle, the cross-subsidization we document in the
previous section could stem only (or predominantly) from implicit performance
allocation. Although, other than providing suggestive evidence that cross-
trading plays a role, we cannot trace how cross-subsidization is achieved,
in this section we present a different test of cross-subsidization receipt. The
contribution of these results is twofold. Not only do they constitute a different

12 For example, Nelson’s Directory of Investment Research typically lists within each ﬁrm the asset classes and the
key investment professionals (CIO, Director of Research, and several managers), without precise designation
which manager is (primarily) responsible for which product. Our conversations with industry insiders revealed
that there appear to be at least two reasons for such reluctance to commit speciﬁc managers to speciﬁc products.
First, institutional asset management ﬁrms strive to make an impression with every investor that they all have
access to the top, the most talented managers available, and that they are “well-taken care of.” This is much easier
to achieve if the ﬁrm is not pinned down to commit speciﬁc managers to speciﬁc products. Second, ﬁrms try to
minimize potentially adverse effects of manager departures. It is easier to claim that, despite the departure of a
speciﬁc talented manager, there are still many great managers available to investors, and they are all available
to every investor, then it is to deal with investor anxiety if their, speciﬁcally listed manager, is the one who had
departed.

and very compelling returns-based test of cross-subsidization, but they also cast
serious doubt that the only mechanism deployed to achieve cross-subsidization
is merely implicit in nature, that is, strategic allocation of managerial talent and
effort.

The empirical setup we utilize in this section exploits the importance of
3-year performance as a pivotal metric clients use to evaluate products. It is
important not only in its own right, as a frequently used performance metric
and marketing tool, but also as an integral part of various ratings that take
3-year performance as one of the factors in constructing composite performance
measures.13 In this analysis, we relate product monthly adjusted returns in
month t to past product monthly performance over the window of ﬁve months
surrounding month t–36, the month about to drop out of the window constituting
the product’s 3-year performance record:

The indicator variables Topi,t−36+j, j =−5,−4, ...4, 5 are set to one if return
to product i in month t−36+ j, j =−5,−4, ...4, 5 had been ranked in the top
quintile among all product pursuing the same investment objective that month
as product i did, and is set to zero otherwise. The key coefﬁcients are those
related to our measures of cross-subsidization, that is, those associated with
interaction terms RelSmalli,t−1×Topi,t−36+j, j =−5,−4, ...4, 5. The importance

13 A prominent example is the well-known Morningstar Rating, comprised of the rating over the most recent 3-year
period, the most recent 5-year period (if applicable), and the most recent 10-year period (if applicable). For
investment vehicles with track records of at least three, but not ﬁve years, all 100% of the rating is based on
the 3-year horizon. For those with track records of at least ﬁve, but not 10 years, 40% of the rating is based
on the 3-year horizon and 60% is based on the 5-year horizon (also encompassing the most recent three years).
Finally, for those with track records of at least 10 years, 20% of the rating is based on the 3-year horizon, 30% is
based on the 5-year horizon (also encompassing the most recent three years), and 50% is based on the 10-year
horizon (also encompassing the most recent three years). Each of the ratings across various horizons is based on
risk-adjusted return measures within investment objectives/categories.

strong, cross-subsidization during month t should be particularly pronounced
because avoiding a drop in rankings will require that a strong performance in
month t replace the outgoing strong performance in month t−36. This notion
is not critical for the ﬁve months preceding month t−36 (they already had
dropped out of the 3-year window). Also, it is not as critical for the ﬁve months
following month t−36 because those months will not disappear from the 3-year
window yet. Thus, the ﬁnding that the coefﬁcient γ−36 is substantially larger
than any of the other cross-subsidization regression coefﬁcients γ−36+j , j =
−5,−4,−3,−2,−1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 would be consistent with cross-subsidization
for the purpose of preventing a deterioration of 3-year ranking.

The results of this regression analysis are presented in Table 4 and Figure 1.
In short, we ﬁnd evidence consistent with cross-subsidization only for month
t−36. The point estimate of γ−36 is 8.8 bps per month (statistically signiﬁcant
at the 1% level). None of the point estimates pertaining to the ﬁve months
preceding it or following it are even remotely comparable in terms of magnitude,
let alone statistical signiﬁcance. Moreover, the point estimate of γ−36 is larger

Key regression coefﬁcients from Table 4
This ﬁgure displays key regression coefﬁcient estimates of γ−36 and γ−36+j, j =−5,−4,−3,−2,−1, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, associated with RelSmalli,t × Topi,t−36+j, j =−5,−4, ...4, 5 from Equation (3), as presented in Table 4. The

than the average point estimate of the remaining ten gamma coefﬁcients
by practically the same margin of 8.7 bps per month (also statistically
signiﬁcant at the 1% level). These results not only strengthen our evidence
of cross-subsidization by means of a novel empirical strategy, but they also
suggest that, given the associated frictions and transaction costs, within-ﬁrm
reallocation of managerial talent, research resources, or effort across products
(especially at such a high frequency) is not a plausible primary explanation for
cross-subsidization in the institutional asset management ﬁrms.14
As a brief robustness check, the relation between performance and imminent
departure of a strong performance month t−36 from the 3-year performance
record should strengthen in the month of December because investors tend
to pay the most attention to year-end performance. In Table 5, we report an
analysis of the 3-year horizon that considers separately December observations
and all the remaining observations. Indeed, the regression coefﬁcient γ−36 is

14 For robustness, we also estimate regression speciﬁcations analogous to Equation (3), with suitably replaced sets
of covariates to reﬂect different horizons from one to six years (12 to 72 months). The results of these regression
analyses are presented in Appendix Table A1. That table also serves to differentiate portfolio management effects
from asset-pricing seasonality effects documented in Heston and Sadka (2008). Simply put, 12-, 36-, and 60-
month horizons are commonly regarded as very important performance evaluation horizons, unlike 24-, 48-,
and 72-month horizons. If asset-pricing seasonality effects from Heston and Sadka (2008) are at play, the results
should obtain for all horizons from one to six years, but if portfolio management effects are at play, the results
should obtain only for 12-, 36-, and 60-month horizons. Appendix Table A1 conﬁrms the portfolio management
effects because only 12-, 36-, and 60-month horizons feature large and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcients.

with the baseline annual gap of 1.695% from Table 3, around 14 bps/month,
and conclude that the intensity of the return reaction in the “t−36 analyses”
is around one-half (around 6.6 bps/month) of the implied 14 bps/month
ﬁgure in non-December months, and is somewhat more than twice (around
31.6 bps/month) of the implied 14 bps/month ﬁgure in December.16

2.3 Robustness checks of the baseline results
The domestic-equity product-year observations in our sample include both
actively-managed products (constituting more than 90% of all observations)
and index products. As our ﬁrst robustness check, we show that index product

15 As elsewhere in the paper, we have provided suggestive evidence grounded in patterns of returns consistent with
cross-subsidization, but data limitations preclude us from tracing the precise mechanisms that generate these
return patterns. Instead, we point to the evidence, compiled by Carhart et al. (2002), of the propensity of mutual
funds to create well-timed price pressures for the purpose of boosting short-term (daily) returns of their funds
(“leaning for the tape”) at the very ends of typical reporting periods: end-of-quarter and, particularly, end-of-year
dates. It is plausible that similar tools may be used by institutional asset management ﬁrms in pursuit of 1-, 3-,
and 5 year performance records, particularly those ending in the month of December.

16 From another perspective, although the return reactions in our “t−36 analyses” are small relative to the magnitude
of the disappearing monthly t−36 return (the median top-quintile style and size-adjusted monthly return in month
t−36 is 2.11% per month), in case of December, 31.6 /month constitutes around 0.316/2.11 = 15% of the median
top-quintile disappearing return in month t−36.

This table displays estimates of key regression coefﬁcients from Equations (1) and (2), estimated over subsamples
of active products (Column 2) and index products (Column 3). The last column provides differences between
the coefﬁcient estimates from Columns 2 and 3, estimated in a pooled regression. The ﬁrst column replicates the
baseline results from Table 3. In all regressions, the dependent variable is ARi,t+1, style- and size-adjusted product
performance in year t+1. Sections 1 and 2 describe key independent variables, including RelSmalli,t , RelBigi,t ,
Topi,t , and TopElsewhereInFirmi,t . Controls include lagged adjusted annual returns, product assets and ﬁrm
assets (both in logarithmic form), as well as their squares. All speciﬁcations include year x style effects, as well
as ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity and dependence of
observations across the same ﬁrm. ***, **, and * indicate signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

return patterns suggest that index products, as one might suspect, do not
take part in cross-subsidization receipt or cross-subsidization provision. As
shown in Table 6, regression coefﬁcients associated with cross-subsidization
are very small in magnitude and are statistically indistinguishable from zero
for index products (Column 3). For actively-managed domestic-equity products
(Column 3), on the other hand, regression coefﬁcients are very similar to those
for the overall sample. The difference between active and index products,
obtained by introducing a full set of interaction terms for every covariate in
the baseline speciﬁcation (including effects), is large in magnitude and is itself
statistically signiﬁcant (Column 4).

Another robustness test is focused on the variation of intensity in cross-
subsidization with broad market conditions.At times of higher market volatility,
the standard deviation of product returns is higher than at times of lower
market volatility, making it possible to get away with more cross-subsidization
at times of higher market volatility than at times of lower market volatility.

This table displays estimates of key regression coefﬁcients from Equations (1) and (2), estimated over subsamples
deﬁned by market volatility in year t +1. Column 1 captures high-volatility years (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and
2002); Column 2 captures medium-volatility years (1996, 1997, 2003, 2004, and 2007); and Column 3 captures
low-volatility years (1993, 1994, 1995, 2005, and 2006). The last column provides a modiﬁed speciﬁcation
that provides continuous variation in cross-subsidization intensity by interacting the key cross-subsidization
coefﬁcients with market volatility. In all regressions, the dependent variable is ARi,t+1, the style- and size-adjusted
product performance in year t+1. Sections 1 and 2 describe key independent variables, including RelSmalli,t ,
RelBigi,t , Topi,t , and TopElsewhereInFirmi,t . Controls include lagged adjusted annual returns, product assets
and ﬁrm assets (both in logarithmic form), as well as their squares. All speciﬁcations include year × style
effects, as well as ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity and
dependence of observations across the same ﬁrm. ***, **, and * indicate signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
level, respectively.

We conﬁrm this pattern in Table 7, featuring three subsamples (covering ﬁve
years each) deﬁned by high, medium, and low market volatility. In accordance
with decreasing market volatility, there is decreasing intensity of cross-
subsidization, ranging for cross-subsidization receipt (Panel A) from 2.23% per
year at times of high market volatility, to 1.47% per year and 1.09% per year
at times of medium and low volatility, respectively. There is a similar pattern
in connection with cross-subsidization provision (Panel B). The speciﬁcations
featured in the last column of Table 7 are deﬁned over the entire sample of
product-year observations. There, variation of cross-subsidization intensity
is captured with MktVoli,t, a continuous measure of annual market volatility

Cross-Subsidization in Institutional Asset Management Firms

expressed in percentage per year, with the key regression coefﬁcients associated
with the triple interactions RelSmalli,t×Topi,t
×
×MktVoli,t and RelBigi,t
×MktVoli,t, respectively. As shown in both panels of
TopElsewhereInFirmi,t
the last column, the triple interactions have the expected sign—positive
for cross-subsidization receipt (indicating more receipt at times of higher
market volatility) and negative for cross-subsidization receipt (indicating more
provision at times of higher market volatility).

The next set of robustness checks exploits variation in ﬁrm-level cross-
trading practices and product age. Cross-subsidization practices involve within-
ﬁrm coordination wherein a buy order of a particular security made by one
product is matched with a sale order from another product managed by the same
ﬁrm, resulting in a transfer of the security from the product looking to sell it to
the product looking to buy it. Such cross-trades, though potentially beneﬁcial
for both parties, also have room for conﬂicts of interest. Our prediction is
that evidence consistent with cross-subsidization receipt will be stronger in the
subsample of product-year observations associated with ﬁrms that self-reported
the use of cross-trading practices in their ADV forms. However, evidence of
stronger cross-subsidization receipt is also consistent with managerial skill
related to cross-trading that does not resort to cross-subsidization, ostensibly
by using cross-trading to execute trades more conveniently, efﬁciently, and at
more favorable prices. On the other hand, the accompanying prediction that
evidence consistent with cross-subsidization provision will be stronger in the
subsample of product-year observations associated with ﬁrms that self-reported
the use of cross-trading practices in theirADV forms is more discerning because
it is not consistent with superior managerial skill.

Panel A of Table 8 displays the results (the ﬁrst column of Table 8 replicates
the results of the baseline speciﬁcation for the full sample). The results in
the top half of Panel A show that cross-subsidization receipt is larger for
the products in ﬁrms pursuing cross-trading practices than for the products
in ﬁrms not pursuing cross-trading practices (3.14% per year versus 0.93%
per year; both are statistically signiﬁcant, as is their difference of 2.21% per
year). The bottom half offers evidence that these differences are mirrored on the
supply side of cross-subsidization. Speciﬁcally, evidence of cross-subsidization
provision among relatively big products is larger for the observations associated
with ﬁrms pursuing cross-trading practices (−1.12% per year, statistically
signiﬁcant) than for the products not pursuing them (−0.52% per year, not
statistically signiﬁcant), although this evidence is only suggestive because
the difference between the two coefﬁcients itself, −0.60% per year, is not
statistically signiﬁcant.

Panel B of Table 8 is devoted to the consideration of product age, another
product characteristic plausibly related to cross-subsidization. The ﬁrst few
years of the product’s existence are crucial because the ﬁrm’s ability to attract
investors will be signiﬁcantly impeded if the initial track record, typically
three years of performance, is not noteworthy. This creates particularly strong

This table displays estimates of key regression coefﬁcients from Equations (1) and (2), estimated over subsamples
deﬁned by ﬁrm cross-trading practices (Panel A) and product age (Panel B). The ﬁrst column replicates the
baseline results from Table 3. In all regressions, the dependent variable is ARi,t+1, the style- and size-adjusted
product performance in year t+1. Sections 1 and 2 describe key independent variables, including RelSmalli,t ,
RelBigi,t , Topi,t , and TopElsewhereInFirmi,t . Controls include lagged adjusted annual returns, product assets,
and ﬁrm assets (both in logarithmic form), as well as their squares. All speciﬁcations include year x style
effects, as well as ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity and
dependence of observations across the same ﬁrm. ***, **, and * indicate signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%

incentives to cross-subsidize young products. Accordingly, the top section
of Panel B, Table 8 suggests that cross-subsidization receipt declines with
product age; it is particularly strong for very young products (0-3 years).
As shown in the bottom section of Panel B, and also consistent with cross-
subsidization, evidence of cross-subsidization provision is completely absent
for very young products (in the initial stages of building their performance
records and, therefore, unlikely to be called on to provide cross-subsidization),
and is strong for older products.

Our baseline tests and a number of reported robustness tests have been based
on adjusted annual product returns. The reporting practices of institutional asset
managers have been (and continue to be) such that about two-thirds of the
managers have been reporting monthly returns and the remaining third have
been reporting only quarterly returns. Therefore, reliance on monthly returns
would have implied a loss of about one-third of the observations. Instead, we
developed a deliberate benchmarking strategy and a difference-in-differences
estimator that, taken together, address benchmarking issues as well as possible
without employing estimation from monthly returns. Nonetheless, to provide
reassurance that our results hold up in such alternative contexts, even with a

This table displays regression coefﬁcient estimates from Equations (1) and (2), presented in Panels A and B,
respectively. In both regressions, the dependent variable is ARi,t+1. The ﬁrst column replicates the baseline results
from Table 3, with ARi,t+1 deﬁned as style- and size-adjusted return net of the median product pursuing the same
investment style in the same asset size quartile as product i in year t. The second column features adjusted
returns ARi,t+1 deﬁned as 4-factor alphas from in-sample monthly regressions of the 12 monthly observations
for product i returns in year t +1 on the four standard risk factors (RMRF, SMB, HML, and PR1Y; Carhart
1997) in year t +1. Finally, the third column features out-of-sample adjusted returns ARi,t+1, deﬁned as the
average of the differences between the twelve product i’s monthly returns in year t +1 and contemporaneous
ﬁtted monthly returns based on factor realizations in year t+ 1 and 4-factor out-of-sample regression loadings
from the regression of product i’s returns on the four standard risk factors (Carhart 1997) over the preceding 24
months (years t−1 and t). Sections 1 and 2 describe key independent variables, including RelSmalli,t , RelBigi,t ,
Topi,t , and TopElsewhereInFirmi,t . Controls include lagged adjusted product returns ARi,t , product assets and
ﬁrm domestic equity assets (both in logarithmic form), as well as their squares. Effects include year x style effects
and ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity and dependence of
observations across the same ﬁrm. ***, **, and * indicate signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

them in Table 9.

The ﬁrst column of Table 9 replicates the baseline results from Table 3 (based
on annual returns). The second column features the ﬁrst robustness test based
on monthly data, with a decline in the number of observations relative to the
baseline speciﬁcation of nearly one-third (N = 20,798). It features adjusted
returns ARi,t+1 deﬁned as 4-factor alphas from in-sample monthly regressions
of the twelve monthly observations for product i returns in year t +1 on the
four standard risk factors (RMRF, SMB, HML, and PR1Y; Carhart 1997) in

i’s monthly returns in year t +1 and contemporaneous ﬁtted monthly returns
based on factor realizations in year t +1 and 4-factor out-of-sample regression
coefﬁcient estimates from the regression of product i’s returns on the four
standard risk factors (Carhart 1997) over the preceding 24 months (years t−1
and t). Because this approach requires availability of product returns for a period
of two years before the estimation period, the number of observations declines
still further, to N = 16,600). All the other details of estimation concerning the
second and third columns are as in previous tables. In short, results based on
stringent controls for known priced risk factors are consistent with our baseline
results.

The institutional asset management ﬁrm clients may focus on performance
records over horizons longer than one year. Our aim in estimating and reporting
results based on a 1-year past performance as an indicator of high value
to the ﬁrm was to maximize the number of observations (and, hence, the
power of our tests), at the same time looking to minimize survivorship issues
(considering longer product performance track records conditions on the
survival of such products). To provide additional assurance that our results
do not depend on choosing a 1-year performance-measurement horizon to
assess past performance, we have also estimated the baseline analyses from
both panels of Table 3 with longer horizons (two, three, and four years of past
performance measurement) and have found that the results remain unchanged
(Appendix Table A2).

Finally, our speciﬁcations feature not only product size and ﬁrm size, but also
relative size of a product relative to other products in the ﬁrm. To alleviate the
concern that the results might be intimately linked to the complex nature of our
speciﬁcations, inAppendix TableA3 we provide an alternative speciﬁcation that
relies on one simple, intuitive variable, RelativeSize, without using it further to
construct the more complex and deliberately built indicator variables capturing
relative size. As shown in Appendix Table A3, all the results obtain as they
did in the main speciﬁcations, reiterating that our results do not depend on the
complex size speciﬁcations.

3. Results Concerning Heterogeneity of Institutional Asset Management

Firm Clients

Sialm, Starks, and Zhang (2015) show that DC plans investing in mutual funds
possess more ﬁnancial sophistication and expertise than other, mostly retail
mutual-fund investors.17 In the domain of institutional asset management ﬁrms,

17 Many retail mutual-fund investors pay brokers or ﬁnancial advisors for fund selection and advice. Bergstresser,
Chalmers, and Tufano (2009) compare broker-sold and direct-sold fund performance and do not ﬁnd tangible
beneﬁts of such advice in the domain of retail mutual-fund investors. If anything, risk-adjusted returns delivered
by broker-sold funds were found to be lower than risk-adjusted returns delivered by direct-sold funds. Whether
brokers provide substantial intangible beneﬁts to retail mutual-fund investors or there are material conﬂicts of
interest between brokers and their mutual-fund clients, the overarching conclusion is that retail mutual-fund

Cross-Subsidization in Institutional Asset Management Firms

it is unclear whether the expertise of plan sponsors and consultants selecting
investment options for tax-exempt clients (pension plans, endowments, and
foundations) exceeds the expertise of wealth managers selecting investment
options for taxable clients (mostly high net-worth individuals).

However, tax-exempt and taxable clienteles investing through institutional
asset management ﬁrms differ in regard to the agency issues that permeate the
processes of selecting, monitoring, and changing investment options. As the
literature (Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny 1992; Goyal and Wahal 2008)
points out, that corporate treasurers and investment committees, acting as
plan sponsors on behalf of various tax-exempt clients, are not the ultimate
beneﬁciaries18 adds layers of complexity to the agency issues. By contrast,
in case of taxable clientele (mostly high net-worth individuals), plan sponsors
typically are the beneﬁciaries. Inserting various consultants or wealth advisors
as an additional layer between plan sponsors and money managers affects the
complexity of the process equally for both clienteles. Therefore, on average,
the process employed by taxable clients has fewer layers and is both simpler
and less burdened by agency issues and frictions than the process employed by
tax-exempt clients.

3.1 Flow-performance relation: Differential incentives across

taxable and tax-exempt clients

Differential complexity of the search process and the associated agency issues
suggest differential ﬂow-performance relations. Taxable clients should be less
encumbered and, therefore, positioned to chase winners and drop losers to a
higher extent than tax-exempt clients. Our ﬁrst analysis tests this hypothesis
by using a canonical ﬂow-performance relation speciﬁcation to compare the
ﬂow-performance sensitivities of the two clienteles:

Flowi,t+1 = β0Past Performancei,t +controls+effects+ εi,t+1.

(4)

Consistent with Sirri and Tufano (1998) and Sialm, Starks, and Zhang
(2015), we begin by calculating for each product-year observation
PerformanceRanki,t,
the product’s percentile rank within its investment
objective in year t, scaled to the unit
interval (0 represents the worst
fund, and 1 represents the best fund). To capture nonlinearity in the
ﬂow-performance relation, we represent past performance with three
piecewise
PerformanceLowi,t = min(PerformanceRanki,t,
0.2),
and
PerformanceHighi,t = (PerformanceRanki,t
are

0.6),
−Lowi,t−Midi,t). Controls

PerformanceMidi,t = min(PerformanceRanki,t

−Lowi,t,

terms,

linear

investors as a whole are not characterized by particularly high, tangible levels of ﬁnancial sophistication and
expertise (their own or their brokers’).

18 Rather, the beneﬁciaries of pension plans are government or corporate employees and retirees, the beneﬁciaries

of endowments are universities and other institutions, and so on.

taxable assets

(log(TaxableAssetsi,t)),

the indicator variable TopElsewhereInFirmi,t, capturing the ﬂow-spillover
effects of the so-called star phenomenon (Nanda, Wang, and Zheng 2004),
the product’s
tax-exempt assets
(log(TaxExemptAssetsi,t)), ﬁrm domestic-equity assets (log(FirmDEAssetsi,t)),
product age in years (log(1+Agei,t)), and, in some speciﬁcations, annual
turnover Turnoveri,t and the product’s expense ratio ExpenseRatioi,t. Effects
include year-by-style effects (ensuring identiﬁcation of effects among products
with the same year and style, rather than across years and styles) and ﬁrm
effects (ensuring that any variable varying only by ﬁrm is absorbed and cannot
explain our ﬁndings). We calculate standard errors by clustering in a way
that allows for heteroskedasticity as well as correlation across observations
associated with the same ﬁrm.

There is a pronounced nonlinearity in the ﬂow-performance relation among
taxable accounts, particularly for the top quintile of product performance
(the magnitude of the coefﬁcient is about 1.1 to 1.2, as displayed in the
ﬁrst and fourth columns of Table 10).19 By contrast, the ﬂow-performance
relation among tax-exempt accounts appears far less nonlinear.20 Figure 2
further illustrates the regression results. The lines representing taxable
ﬂows (black) and tax-exempt ﬂows (gray), respectively, are based on the
coefﬁcient estimates associated with PerformanceHighi,t, PerformanceMidi,t,
and PerformanceLowi,t from the ﬁrst two columns of Table 10. Both lines in
the ﬁgure are deliberately offset so that the median performers (at the 50th
percentile, or 0.5) have the reference, zero ﬂow. This enables the interpretation
of any point on a line as a ﬂow relative to the ﬂow to the median performer.

In sum, the greater elasticity and convexity of taxable ﬂow suggest higher
marginal beneﬁts to cross-subsidization and, therefore, predicts more cross-
subsidization toward, and less cross-subsidization away from, taxable clients.
We conﬁrm this prediction by comparing cross-subsidization receipt and
provision across subsamples of products dominated by taxable investment
and products dominated by tax-exempt investment. In Panel A of Table 11,
the dominance of taxable (tax-exempt) investment is deﬁned as at least
50% of the product’s assets under management held in taxable (tax-exempt)
accounts. In Panel B, the comparison is performed across products with
exclusively taxable and exclusively tax-exempt accounts. In both panels, cross-
subsidization toward taxable products is more than twice as intense as it is
toward tax-exempt products. In Panel A, the difference between 2.41% and
1.02% per year is 1.39% per year, statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level.

19 The evidence of nonlinearity in the ﬂow-performance relation among the taxable clientele is similar to the
nonlinearity documented in the mutual fund literature (e.g., Chevalier and Ellison 1997; Ippolito 1992; Sirri and
Tufano 1998).

20 The absence of pronounced nonlinearity in the ﬂow-performance relation among the tax-exempt clientele is

consistent with the results concerning pension-fund ﬂows reported by Del Guercio and Tkac (2002).

This table displays regression coefﬁcient estimates from Equation (4), estimated separately for taxable ﬂows
and tax-exempt ﬂows. The table also features a comparison of the respective regression coefﬁcients, obtained by
calculating their differences in a pooled speciﬁcation. The ﬁrst three columns seeks to maximize the number of
observations participating in the regression (by not including the scarcely reported turnover and expense ratio),
whereas the last three columns feature these two variables. In all regressions, the dependent variable is Flowi,t+1,
ﬂow of investment to product i in year t+ 1. Section 3.1 describes key independent variables, PerformanceHighi,t ,
PerformanceMidi,t , and PerformanceLowi,t , and Section 1 describes the other independent variables. Controls
in both panels include product taxable and tax-exempt assets and ﬁrm assets (both in logarithmic form). Controls
in Panel B also include product annual turnover Turnoveri,t and expense ratio ExpenseRatioi,t . All speciﬁcations
include year x style effects, as well as ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for
heteroskedasticity and dependence of observations across the same ﬁrm. The bottom of the table features p-
values from F-tests comparing performance sensitivities coefﬁcients. ***, **, and * indicate signiﬁcance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

The corresponding estimates are very similar in Panel B, although the cross-
subsidization receipt coefﬁcient of 0.91 is not statistically signiﬁcant. Provision
of cross-subsidization by taxable products is statistically indistinguishable from
zero in both panels. At the same time, it is more pronounced among tax-exempt
products. The point estimates for tax-exempt products are very similar across
the two panels, −0.78% per year in Panel A and −0.83% per year in Panel
B; both are statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level. Differences between point
estimates of cross-subsidization provision for products dominated by taxable
investors and those dominated by tax-exempt investors are large, −0.49% per
year in Panel A and −0.72% per year in Panel B, where the latter is statistically
signiﬁcant.

Figure 2
Flow-performance relation for taxable and tax-exempt ﬂows
This ﬁgure displays the piecewise linear ﬂow-performance relation for taxable and tax-exempt ﬂows. The lines
representing taxable ﬂows (black) and tax-exempt ﬂows (gray), respectively, are based on the coefﬁcient estimates
associated with PerformanceHighi,t , PerformanceMidi,t , and PerformanceLowi,t from the ﬁrst two columns of
Table 10. Both lines are deliberately offset so that the median performers (at the 50th percentile, or 0.5) have the
reference, zero ﬂow.

3.2 More discerning or more cross-subsidized?
The results reported in the previous section raise the possibility that identifying
an investment option likely to generate superior returns need not only mean
identifying a talented manager, but may also mean identifying a setting in
which the institutional asset management ﬁrm is willing to enhance product
performance by cross-subsidizing it. In this section, we provide empirical
evidence that such a set of circumstances may be at play in institutional asset
management ﬁrms. We start by adapting a test proposed in Sialm, Starks, and
Zhang (2015, 833; Equation (9)) to the present setting. Speciﬁcally, we compare
the abilities of the investment ﬂows by taxable and tax-exempt clienteles to
predict product investment performance:

ARi,t+1 = β0 TaxableFlowi,t + β1TaxExemptFlowi,t +controls+effects+ εi,t+1.

(5)

Controls are the product’s lagged return, percentage of tax-exempt assets
in total product assets, product assets (log(Assetsi,t)), ﬁrm domestic-equity
assets (log(FirmDEAssetsi,t)), as well as their squares, product age in years
(log(1+Agei,t)), and, in some speciﬁcations, annual turnover Turnoveri,t and
the product’s expense ratio ExpenseRatioi,t. Like elsewhere in the paper, effects

This table displays estimates of key regression coefﬁcients from Equations (1) and (2), estimated over subsamples
deﬁned by client tax status. The ﬁrst column replicates the baseline results from Table 3. Panel A features
a comparison of predominantly taxable products and predominantly tax-exempt products. Panel B features
a comparison of exclusively taxable and exclusively tax-exempt products. In all regressions, the dependent
variable is ARi,t+1, the style- and size-adjusted product performance in year t+1. Sections 1 and 2 display the
key independent variables, including RelSmalli,t , RelBigi,t , Topi,t , and TopElsewhereInFirmi,t . Controls include
lagged adjusted annual returns, product assets, and ﬁrm assets (both in logarithmic form), as well as their squares.
All speciﬁcations include year x style effects, as well as ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering
that accounts for heteroskedasticity and dependence of observations across the same ﬁrm. ***, **, and * indicate

include year-by-style effects and ﬁrm effects, and we calculate standard errors
by clustering in a way that allows for heteroskedasticity as well as correlation
across observations associated with the same ﬁrm. The results (Table 12)
suggest that, across the three speciﬁcations, tax-exempt clientele ﬂows are
worse predictors of product investment performance than taxable clientele
ﬂows, making the latter more discerning in the parlance of Sialm, Starks,
and Zhang (2015). In the mutual-fund setting, it is intuitive and plausible that
“more discerning” could mean that the ﬁnancial sophistication of those making
investment decisions concerning DC plans would be superior to the ﬁnancial
sophistication of retail investors. In our setting, however, there does not appear
to be a clear ordering along the lines of ﬁnancial sophistication between taxable
and tax-exempt clienteles, but there are differential incentives for, and practices
of, cross-subsidization across the two clienteles in favor of taxable clients.

This observation leads to our ﬁnal test, focusing on teasing out the role of
cross-subsidization in positioning taxable clients as more discerning than tax-
exempt clients. To that end, we develop a careful matching between investment
performance of taxable dollar ﬂows and investment performance of highly
comparable tax-exempt ﬂows. First, we group product-year observations in

This table displays estimates of regression coefﬁcients from Equation (5). In all regressions, the dependent
variable is ARi,t+1, style- and size-adjusted product performance in year t +1. Section 1 describes key independent
variables, including TaxableFlowi,t and TaxExemptFlowi,t . Controls include lagged adjusted annual returns,
percentage of tax-exempt assets in total product assets, product assets and ﬁrm assets (both in logarithmic form),
as well as their squares, product age (in logarithmic form), annual turnover, and expense ratio. All speciﬁcations
include year x style effects, as well as ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for

of year t and quintiles of product adjusted performance at the end of year t.
Second, within each bin we calculate for each product-year observation the
difference between product adjusted returns in year t+ 1 of a product featuring
a certain taxable dollar ﬂow in year t and its matched product from a different
ﬁrm that pursues the same investment objective and features the tax-exempt
dollar ﬂow in year t that is the closest to the original product’s taxable dollar
ﬂow. Third, we estimate 20 regressions—one for each bin—of these return

Illustration of alignment of discerning performance and cross-subsidization
This ﬁgure displays key regression coefﬁcients from Table 13. Statistical signiﬁcance is indicated with black color

(log(FirmDEAssetsi,t),
log(FirmDEAssetsMATCHED(i),t )). Also, we calculate
standard errors by clustering in a way that allows for heteroskedasticity as
well as correlation across observations associated with the same ﬁrm.

The logic behind this exercise is simple. If indeed the only thing going on
is that “more discerning” translates into taxable clients’ superior investment
acumen, the dollar commitments made by taxable clients should be rather
uniformly “smarter” across the 20 bins than the comparable dollar commitments
made by tax-exempt clients into very similar investment opportunities,
matched along relevant observable dimensions. If, on the other hand, there
is a pronounced role for cross-subsidization in explaining the ﬁnding that
taxable clients appear more discerning, evidence of superior performance
by the taxable clients should be concentrated in the pockets of the two-
dimensional grid deﬁned by relative size and past performance that resonate
very closely with the circumstances conducive to, and consistent with, receiving
cross-subsidization.

An inspection of the results from Table 13, also depicted in Figure 3,
provides compelling evidence in favor of the latter. By far the largest gap
of 1.14% per year, signiﬁcant at the 5% level, is present in the bin in which one
would expect the most cross-subsidization receipt—relatively small products
with the past product performance in the top quintile. The two next highest
performance gaps of around 0.8% per year, both statistically signiﬁcant at the
10% level, are positioned in the two bins adjacent to the “winning” relatively

This table displays results of 20 estimations of the regression from Equation (6), one for each group of product-
year observations. The groups are formed by a double sort into 20 bins, deﬁned by quartiles of product relative
size at the end of year t and quintiles of product adjusted performance at the end of year t. Within each
bin, the dependent variable is calculated as the difference between product adjusted returns in year t+ 1 of
a product featuring a certain taxable dollar ﬂow in year t and its matched product from a different ﬁrm that
pursues the same investment objective and features the tax-exempt dollar ﬂow in year t that is the closest to
the original product’s taxable dollar ﬂow. As detailed in Section 3.2, controls are the respective product assets
(log(Assetsi,t ), log(AssetsMATCHED(i),t)) and their respective ﬁrm domestic-equity assets (log(FirmDEAssetsi,t ),
log(FirmDEAssetsMATCHED(i),t )). Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity
and dependence of observations across the same ﬁrm. ***, **, and * indicate signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and

small, top past performance bin. None of the other bins yielded a performance
gap that is nearly as large in magnitude, let alone statistically signiﬁcant.
The overall conclusion, then, is revealing—institutional asset management
ﬁrms appear to respond to the incentives for cross-subsidization (as captured
by the differential ﬂow-performance relations across the two clienteles) by
arranging for more intense cross-subsidization receipt to taxable clients. These
activities create an impression that the characterization of “more discerning”
may derive from better skill, but our results suggest a more compelling
alternative explanation—“more discerning” very likely means “more intensely
cross-subsidized.”

Cross-Subsidization in Institutional Asset Management Firms

4. Conclusion

We use a unique database free of survivorship bias, backﬁlling bias,
and revision bias to study cross-subsidization among U.S. equity products
managed by institutional asset management ﬁrms. Using difference-in-
differences estimation, we ﬁnd returns-based circumstantial evidence of cross-
subsidization receipt by the ﬁrm’s high value and easy-to-cross-subsidize
products (strong recent performers that are relatively small in their respective
ﬁrms). We also ﬁnd complementary evidence of cross-subsidization provision
by products with large assets under management relative to other domestic
equity products managed by the same ﬁrm. Our data do not enable a detailed
study of the mechanisms likely deployed to achieve cross-subsidization (e.g.,
cross-trading, hot IPO allocation, preferential idea allocation, favoritism in
trade execution). Instead, we take advantage of the importance of the 3-year
performance horizon (commonly used by clients to evaluate products) not
only to show further evidence of cross-subsidization, but also to suggest that
cross-subsidization realistically could not be generated only through implicit
performance allocation such as managerial talent or other resource allocation
within the ﬁrm.

We further study cross-subsidization in institutional asset management
ﬁrms by exploiting clientele heterogeneity, that is, the presence of both tax-
exempt clients (pensions plans, endowments, foundations) and taxable clients
(mostly high net-worth individuals). There is no clear ordering of the ﬁnancial
sophistication between these two groups of investors. However, as argued in
detail in the body of the paper, they feature differential complexity of their
search processes, as well as differential presence of agency issues that permeate
the processes of selecting, monitoring, and changing investment options. These
differences imply that taxable clients should be less encumbered and, therefore,
better positioned to chase winners and drop losers than tax-exempt clients are.
Accordingly, we ﬁnd that the nonlinearity of the ﬂow-performance relation
is more pronounced for taxable clients. Consistent with these differential
incentives for cross-subsidization, we further ﬁnd that, compared to tax-exempt
clients, there is more cross-subsidization toward, and less cross-subsidization
away from, taxable clients.

Identifying a superior investment option need not only mean identifying
a talented manager, but may also mean identifying a setting in which the
institutional asset management ﬁrm is willing to enhance product performance
by cross-subsidizing it. We conﬁrm this intuition in two steps. First, we
show that investment ﬂows by tax-exempt clients are worse predictors of
product investment performance than investment ﬂows by taxable clients,
making the latter more discerning in the parlance of Sialm, Starks, and Zhang
(2015). Second, we show that the performance gap between investments
pursued by taxable ﬂows and matched tax-exempt ﬂows exists only under the

circumstances that, at the same time, are conducive to cross-subsidization—
among recent strong performers that are relatively small in their ﬁrms. Put
differently, we show that, in the domain of institutional asset management
ﬁrms, “more discerning” very likely means “more intensely cross-subsidized.”
From the perspective of the concern whether the returns-based evidence
we present in this paper implies that the institutional asset management
ﬁrms engaging in cross-subsidization are violating any regulation, contractual
obligation, or duty, it is difﬁcult to reconcile the results of this study with any
contract between the sponsor and the money manager that stipulates ﬁduciary
duty or otherwise articulates clear expectations akin to it. In that regard, the
Security and Exchange Commission (2000) was very explicit in its letter to
investment advisers, labeling certain trade allocation practices as harmful,
even fraudulent, especially if they are not adequately disclosed to all clients.
Finally, another challenge associated with enabling cross-subsidization to affect
portfolio performance is that the link between managerial skill and reported
performance is obfuscated. Indeed, in the world in which cross-subsidization is
a reality, the reported product returns no longer truly reﬂect only the managerial
skill.

This table displays key regression coefﬁcient estimates from Equation (3), with adjustments for different horizons
as needed. Panel A reports regression coefﬁcient estimates for the critical month associated with key investment
performance measurement horizon featured in the given column. Panel B reports the difference between that
critical regression coefﬁcient estimate and the average of the surrounding window of ﬁve months preceding
and ﬁve months following the critical month. The six columns feature estimations for the 12-month, 24-month,
36-moth, 48-month, 60-month, and 72-month horizons, respectively. Controls include lagged product monthly
adjusted returns ARi,t−1 (to control for product return persistence), RelSmalli,t , product assets, and ﬁrm domestic
equity assets (both in logarithmic form), as well as their squares. Effects include year x style effects and
ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity and dependence of
observations across the same ﬁrm. ***, **, and * indicate signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

This table displays regression coefﬁcient estimates of β2, the coefﬁcient associated with RelSmalli,t ×Topi,t and
RelBigi,t ×TopElsewhereInFirmi,t in regressions from Equations (1) and (2), respectively, estimated over various
horizons of performance measurement. The horizons, ranging from one to four years, are represented in four
successive columns (the ﬁrst column replicates the baseline, 1-year past performance result from Table 3).
Controls include lagged adjusted product returns, product assets and ﬁrm domestic equity assets (both in
logarithmic form), as well as their squares. Effects include year x style effects and ﬁrm effects. Standard errors
are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity and dependence of observations across the same

These speciﬁcations are close equivalents of Equations (1) and (2). They capture the notion of relative size by using
the variable RelativeSizei,t , as deﬁned in Section 1. Controls include lagged adjusted product returns, product
assets, and ﬁrm domestic equity assets (both in logarithmic form), as well as their squares. Effects include year
× style effects, and ﬁrm effects. Standard errors are adjusted by clustering that accounts for heteroskedasticity
and dependence of observations across the same ﬁrm. ***, **, and * indicate signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and
