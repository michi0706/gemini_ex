Asset Management within Commercial Banking

Groups: International Evidence

MIGUEL A. FERREIRA, PEDRO MATOS, and PEDRO PIRES∗

ABSTRACT

We study the performance of equity mutual funds run by asset management divisions
of commercial banking groups using a worldwide sample. We show that bank-afﬁliated
funds underperform unafﬁliated funds by 92 basis points per year. Consistent with
conﬂicts of interest, the underperformance is more pronounced among those afﬁli-
ated funds that overweight the stock of the bank’s lending clients to a great extent.
Divestitures of asset management divisions by banking groups support a causal inter-
pretation of the results. Our ﬁndings suggest that afﬁliated fund managers support
their lending divisions’ operations to reduce career concerns at the expense of fund
investors.

MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES MANAGE TRILLIONS of U.S. dollars worldwide, but many
of these companies are not stand-alone entities. About 40% of mutual funds
are run by asset management divisions of groups whose primary activity is
commercial banking. This phenomenon is less prevalent in the United States
(only 20% of mutual funds) as a result of the Glass-Steagall Act, which sepa-
rated banking and asset management activities for many decades. Since the
repeal of Glass-Steagall by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, many U.S.

banking groups have begun to develop asset management divisions. Press re-
ports indicate that bank-afﬁliated funds often underperform funds operated by
independent fund management companies, particularly in Europe.1 Yet, aca-
demic research has little to say about the potential spillover effects between
commercial banking and asset management divisions.

When fund management companies are owned by commercial banking
groups, fund managers may beneﬁt the bank’s lending business at the ex-
pense of fund investors (conﬂict of interest hypothesis).2 Alternatively, the
lending business may generate private information about borrowers via credit
origination, monitoring, and renegotiation that is beneﬁcial to the afﬁliated
fund manager (information advantage hypothesis). A third possibility is that
banking groups impose “Chinese walls” to prevent communication between the
asset management and lending divisions, so that funds operate independently
of other bank divisions (null hypothesis).

We test these hypotheses using a comprehensive sample of open-end equity
mutual funds domiciled in 28 countries over the period 2000 to 2010. We focus
on actively managed funds that invest in domestic equities because banks
typically have stronger lending relationships with domestic ﬁrms. We deﬁne
commercial bank-afﬁliated funds as those funds that belong to a management
company that is either majority-owned by a commercial parent bank or part
of a group that owns a commercial bank. The other management companies
are classiﬁed as afﬁliated with investment banks or insurance companies or as
unafﬁliated companies.3

We ﬁnd that, on average, commercial bank-afﬁliated funds underperform
unafﬁliated funds by about 92 basis points per year as measured by four-factor
alphas. We obtain similar results when we use alternative measures of per-
formance such as benchmark-adjusted returns, gross returns, or buy-and-hold
returns. In addition, we ﬁnd that afﬁliated funds underperform more when
the ratio of outstanding loans to assets under management is higher, which is
consistent with greater conﬂicts of interest. When we examine cross-country
differences in the performance of afﬁliated funds, we ﬁnd that “Chinese walls”
between bank lending and asset management activities are more strictly en-
forced and fund investors’ rights are better protected in common-law countries
such as the United States (Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano (2005, 2009)). In the
sample of U.S.-domiciled funds, we ﬁnd less pronounced underperformance and
no relation between performance and measures of conﬂicts of interest with the
lending division.

To examine more directly whether the parent bank’s lending activity is di-
rectly linked to fund underperformance, we measure the overlap between lend-
ing clients and fund stock holdings using the bank’s activity in the syndicated

income represents the largest share of revenues among top banks worldwide.

loan market. A “client stock” is a ﬁrm that obtained a syndicated loan from
the bank during the previous three years and whose shares are held in the
portfolio of a fund afﬁliated with the bank. We show that bank-afﬁliated funds’
portfolio holdings are biased toward client stocks over nonclient stocks. In addi-
tion, we ﬁnd that bank-afﬁliated funds with higher portfolio exposure to client
stocks (in excess of the portfolio weights in passive funds that track the same
benchmark) tend to underperform more.

The endogeneity of the organizational form of a management company makes
it difﬁcult to identify a causal effect. The decision to operate a fund management
company as bank afﬁliated may be related to unobserved fund characteristics
that also explain the performance. We implement two empirical strategies
to address this concern. First, we use fund ﬁxed effects to control for time-
invariant unobserved fund heterogeneity. The estimated underperformance of
afﬁliated funds is even more pronounced in this case, which indicates that per-
formance deteriorates after a fund switches from unafﬁliated to bank-afﬁliated.
Second, we exploit the exogenous variation generated by divestitures of asset
management divisions by commercial banking groups during the 2000 to 2012
period as well as in the aftermath of the 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis, when
banks improved their regulatory capital ratios by divesting asset management
units.4 The evidence shows that funds that switch from afﬁliated to unafﬁl-
iated through divestiture subsequently reduce their holdings of client stocks
and experience improved performance.

One remaining concern with our results is that bank-afﬁliated funds might
hire less skilled fund managers. We examine the portfolio trading of afﬁl-
iated funds using calendar-time portfolio returns. In these tests, we com-
pare manager skill exclusively within afﬁliated funds on their holdings of
client and nonclient stocks. We ﬁnd that funds that overweight client stocks
to a greater extend underperform in the trading of client stocks. However,
these funds do not underperform in the trading of nonclient stocks. More-
over, funds that overweight client stocks to a lesser extent do not underper-
form in the trading of client stocks. These results do not support the skill
hypothesis.

Why do commercial bank-afﬁliated funds exist in equilibrium if they perform
more poorly? We try to understand the motivation of the different agents by
providing evidence on the beneﬁts that accrue to the parent bank and fund
manager, as well as to the borrower. First, we show that banks use afﬁli-
ated fund resources to build lending relationships with borrowers (Bharath
et al. (2007, 2011), Ferreira and Matos (2012)). We ﬁnd that banks are more
likely to act as lead arrangers of future loans when they exert control over
borrowers by holding shares through their asset management divisions; these
holdings increase the probability of initiating a lending relationship and pre-
serving a past lending relationship. Second, we ﬁnd that fund managers that
act as team players for their banking group by overweighting client stocks
are less likely to lose jobs. This result suggests that career concerns help

explain the fund managers’ decisions to support the bank’s interests. Third,
we ﬁnd that afﬁliated funds’ portfolio holdings of client stocks are associated
with less shareholder voting dissent on executive compensation proposals. This
result is consistent with the idea that afﬁliated funds attempt to curry favor
with the borrower’s management in an effort to promote a lending relation-
ship.5 Finally, we ﬁnd that, outside the United States, investors of afﬁliated
funds exhibit inertia as the sensitivity of ﬂows to poor past performance is
insigniﬁcant. This result explains how afﬁliated funds may earn lower returns
without suffering signiﬁcant investor outﬂows and retain a signiﬁcant market
share.

Our work contributes to the literature examining agency conﬂicts in fund
complexes in U.S. markets (Massa (2003), Nanda, Wang, and Zheng (2004),
Gaspar, Massa, and Matos (2006), Cohen and Schmidt (2009)). Recent papers
study the spillover effects between other businesses and asset management
companies afﬁliated with ﬁnancial groups. In the United States, Massa and
Rehman (2008) ﬁnd that bank-afﬁliated funds overweight lending client stocks
around new loan announcements, a strategy that has a short-term positive ef-
fect on fund performance. This result is consistent with the information advan-
tage hypothesis. Other authors, however, ﬁnd evidence of conﬂicts of interest
between investment banks’ underwriting and asset management businesses
(Ritter and Zhang (2007), Johnson and Marietta-Westberg (2009), Hao and
Yan (2012), Berzins, Liu, and Trzcinka (2013)). More recently, Sialm and Tham
(2016) document spillover effects across business segments of publicly traded
fund management companies. Internationally, Golez and Marin (2015) show
that Spanish bank-afﬁliated funds support the price of their own-parent stock,
while Gil-Bazo, Hoffmann, and Mayordomo (2016) show that these funds sup-
ported parent banks’ bond issues during the 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis and
the 2010 to 2012 European sovereign debt crisis. Ghosh, Kale, and Pancha-
pagesan (2014) ﬁnd conﬂicts of interest in business group-afﬁliated funds in
India.

Our main contribution is to provide evidence of conﬂicts of interest between
the lending and asset management divisions of commercial banking groups
using an international sample of mutual funds where such conﬂicts are more
prevalent than in the United States.

I. Hypotheses

The economics underlying our conﬂict of interest hypothesis is that the par-
ent entity (a banking group) can be thought of as a multidivision business

5 In a 2011 Financial Times article, Guillaume Prache, managing director of the European
Federation of Investors, states that “Banks tend to double up their shares, combining the ones
they hold directly with the proxy votes from shares owned by asset management arms. Banks
invariably vote in ways that suit their commercial lending or investment banking arms, not in
ways that reﬂect the interests of end investors.” Ian Fraser, “Conﬂicts of interest a big issue for
banks,” Financial Times, May 22, 2011.

whose objective function is to maximize the combined revenue of all its divi-
sions. While commercial banking operations derive value from lending rela-
tionships with their borrower clients, the asset management division receives
revenues from fees on assets under management, which depend on attract-
ing ﬂows from end investors. The interest of the bank as creditor may conﬂict
with that as equity holder via its afﬁliated funds. While fund managers have a
ﬁduciary responsibility to fund investors, they are also employees of banking
groups, for which revenues from lending usually dominate revenues from asset
management. Thus, the fund manager’s objectives are linked to both the size
of assets under management and continued employment. As a result, instead
of maximizing the risk-adjusted returns of fund investors, the fund manager
may be asked to make portfolio decisions that beneﬁt the parent bank’s inter-
ests.6 For example, the fund manager might overweight a lending client’s stock
to increase voting rights and help build long-term relationships that generate
future loan business. Afﬁliated funds could also be used to temporarily support
the stock price of the bank’s lending clients even if doing so impairs fund perfor-
mance to gain favor with the borrower’s management. This argument predicts
a negative effect on the performance of bank-afﬁliated funds. This leads to our
ﬁrst testable prediction:

HYPOTHESIS 1: Commercial bank-afﬁliated funds underperform unafﬁliated
funds, as well as funds afﬁliated with other types of ﬁnancial conglomerates
(e.g., investment banks and insurance companies).

The extent of the conﬂict of interest in a multidivision banking group de-
pends on the relative size of the commercial banking and asset management
divisions. If the commercial bank’s balance sheet exposure (or loan interest
income) dominates the assets (or revenues) from the asset management divi-
sion, conﬂicts of interest are likely to be more pronounced. In particular, an
afﬁliated fund’s portfolio is likely to be tilted in favor of lending client’s stocks.
This is expected to be perceived favorably by the client ﬁrms, particularly if the
afﬁliated funds help support their stock price. This leads to our second testable
prediction:

HYPOTHESIS 2: The underperformance of commercial bank-afﬁliated funds is
increasing in the relative size of the lending division and the degree of over-
weighting of the bank’s lending-client stocks.

The information advantage hypothesis predicts that bank-afﬁliated fund
managers overweight lending clients’ stocks because they have private infor-
mation on clients that is acquired through the banks’ lending relationships.
In this case, afﬁliated funds’ trades on client stocks should be associated
with outperformance. Alternatively, afﬁliated funds may attract less skilled
managers, in which case fund manager trading should be associated with

6 Portfolio decisions are ultimately in the hands of fund managers. However, fund managers
have incentives to minimize the likelihood that the bank faces ﬁnancial distress, which could lead
to salary cuts, layoffs, and liquidation of the asset management division.

underperformance for both client and nonclient stocks. We can empirically
distinguish the conﬂict of interest hypothesis from these alternatives because
it predicts that afﬁliated funds underperform rather than outperform, and that
the underperformance is observed only in the trades of client stocks, not in the
trades of nonclient stocks. This leads to our third testable prediction:

HYPOTHESIS 3: The trades of a bank’s lending client stocks explain the un-
derperformance of commercial bank-afﬁliated funds: while managers of bank-
afﬁliated funds show below-average skill in the trading of client stocks, they
show average skill in the trading of nonclient stocks.

For the overweighting of client stocks and the underperformance of bank-
afﬁliated funds to exist in equilibrium, it must ﬁrst be the case that the
commercial bank sees a beneﬁt from the afﬁliated funds’ portfolio holdings
of client stocks. We test this prediction by examining whether afﬁliated funds’
holdings increase the probability that a bank retains or gains lending rela-
tionships. Second, it must be the case that the inﬂuence that comes from
afﬁliated funds’ holdings of client stocks generates beneﬁts for the client’s
management. We test this prediction by examining whether clients’ manage-
ment beneﬁts from less shareholder voting dissent on management proposals.
We further test whether fund managers who overweight client stocks have
a lower probability of job loss.7 Finally, we test whether afﬁliated funds’ in-
vestor clientele exhibits inertia, that is, does not react signiﬁcantly to poor
past fund performance. Unafﬁliated fund providers may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to es-
tablish a distribution network in countries where banks have a strong pres-
ence.8 In addition, banks have a competitive advantage in brand recogni-
tion, which allows them to cross-sell by offering mutual funds jointly with
other ﬁnancial products. This discussion leads to the following equilibrium
prediction:

HYPOTHESIS 4: The overweighting of a bank’s client stocks by commercial
bank-afﬁliated fund managers is an equilibrium outcome: (1) the bank bene-
ﬁts from repeated lending relationships, (2) the client’s management beneﬁts
from friendlier voting at shareholder meetings, (3) afﬁliated fund managers
beneﬁt from lower job turnover, and (4) the ﬂows of afﬁliated fund investors
exhibit low sensitivity to poor past fund performance.

7 Fund managers have limited career opportunities in countries where the asset management
industry is dominated by banks and investors mainly rely on the advice of bank branches to select
funds. Thus, bank-afﬁliated fund managers are viewed as bank employees and they have few
incentives to build a track record.

8 A similar argument explains the underperformance of broker-sold mutual funds in the United
States, which could result from conﬂicts of interest between brokers and their clients or from
substantial nontangible beneﬁts offered by brokers (Bergstresser, Chalmers, and Tufano (2009),
Del Guercio and Reuter (2014)). Christoffersen, Evans, and Musto (2013) document other biases
in broker-intermediated funds.

A. Sample of Equity Mutual Funds

II. Data

Data on equity mutual funds come from the Lipper survivorship bias-free
database, which covers many countries worldwide over the 1997 to 2010
period. Although multiple share classes are listed as separate observations in
Lipper, they have the same holdings and the same returns before expenses.
We therefore use the primary share class as our unit of observation and
aggregate fund-level variables across different share classes. We exclude
offshore funds (e.g., funds domiciled in Luxembourg or Dublin), funds-of-
funds, and closed-end funds, which yields a sample of 29,872 open-end equity
funds in 28 countries (18,918 funds that managed over $7.4 trillion as of
December 2010).9

To classify a mutual fund as either afﬁliated or unafﬁliated with a commer-
cial bank, we ﬁrst collect information on each fund’s ultimate owner from the
FactSet database. Speciﬁcally, we match each Lipper fund with the fund’s port-
folio holdings data in FactSet using ISIN and CUSIP fund identiﬁers as well
as management company and fund names. This matching results in a sam-
ple of 16,245 funds (11,556 funds that managed $6.8 trillion as of December
2010). We then match the fund’s ultimate parent obtained from FactSet with
the ultimate owners of banks from the Bureau van Dijk’s BankScope database.
A fund is classiﬁed as afﬁliated with a commercial bank if (1) the fund’s ulti-
mate owner is a commercial bank (i.e., is classiﬁed by BankScope under Bank
Holding & Holding Companies, Cooperative Bank, Commercial Bank, Savings
Bank, or Specialized Governmental Credit Institution) with total assets of over
$10 billion or (2) a commercial bank within the fund’s ultimate owner group
has total assets of over $10 billion.10

We also classify each fund as afﬁliated or unafﬁliated with an invest-
ment bank or insurance company. We use the ultimate owner type from the
BankScope and ISIS databases to identify fund management companies afﬁl-
iated with insurance groups. Next, we use the top 20 banks in the Thomson
Reuters Deal Analytics global equity league tables (by proceeds) for each year
and region (Global, USA, EMEA, and Asia-Paciﬁc) to identify management
companies afﬁliated with investment banks.11

To illustrate our classiﬁcation, funds managed by Wells Fargo Fund Man-
agement (the asset management arm of Wells Fargo & Co) and funds man-
aged by DWS Investments (the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank) are

9 Ferreira et al. (2013) and Cremers et al. (2016) provide a detailed description of this data
source. Lipper’s worldwide data coverage is comprehensive compared to aggregate statistics from
the Investment Company Institute (2011).

10 For insurance groups, we consider only commercial bank subsidiaries with signiﬁcant assets
relative to the total assets of the group. For example, funds afﬁliated with Allianz SE are not
considered commercial bank-afﬁliated.

11 Funds can be classiﬁed in more than one category. For example, funds managed by DWS
Investments (the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank) are classiﬁed as commercial bank-
afﬁliated and investment bank-afﬁliated because Deutsche Bank is a universal banking group.

classiﬁed as commercial bank-afﬁliated. Funds managed by MFS Investment
Management (the asset management arm of Sun Life Financial) and funds
managed by Allianz Global Investors (the asset management arm of Allianz
SE) are classiﬁed as insurance company-afﬁliated. Funds managed by Goldman
Sachs Asset Management (the asset management arm of Goldman Sachs) and
funds managed by Credit Suisse Funds (the asset management arm of Credit
Suisse) are classiﬁed as investment bank-afﬁliated. Finally, funds managed by
Fidelity Investments (parent company is FMR LLC) and funds managed by
Schroders are classiﬁed as unafﬁliated.

We focus on the conﬂict of interest with lending because this is the dominant
activity of the top banks worldwide. For example, in 2010, the world’s top 20
banks (as ranked by total assets) earned about 58% of their revenues from net
interest income generated by loans (from BankScope). In contrast, investment
banking fees (from Thomson Reuters) represent less than 4% of total revenues
among the world’s top banks. We conclude that most revenues for the banks in
our sample are generated from interest income rather than underwriting and
advisory services.

In our main tests, we focus on actively managed domestic funds (i.e., funds
that invest in their local market) because banks typically have stronger lending
relationships with domestic ﬁrms. The sample comprises 7,220 domestic equity
funds in 28 countries over the 2000 to 2010 period. For robustness, we also
perform placebo tests using international funds.

Table I presents the number and total net assets (TNA) of the domestic
funds in our sample by country as of December 2010. Our sample contains
4,981 domestic funds that managed $3.6 trillion in assets in 2010. Domestic
funds afﬁliated with a commercial banking group represent 32% of the number
of funds and 18% of TNA. There is considerable variation in the market share of
commercial bank-afﬁliated funds across countries. While bank-afﬁliated funds
represent only 11% of TNA in the United States, they represent 40% outside
the United States. Indeed, the market share of bank-afﬁliated funds exceeds
50% of TNA in the majority of European countries such as Germany, Italy,
Spain, and Switzerland. Figure 1 shows the time series of the number and
TNA of commercial bank-afﬁliated and unafﬁliated funds. We see a downward
trend in the market share of afﬁliated funds.

In Table IA.I in the Internet Appendix,12 for each sample country, we list the
top ﬁve fund management companies and indicate whether they are afﬁliated
with a commercial bank. In the United States, none of the top ﬁve fund manage-
ment companies are part of a commercial banking group, while in continental
Europe, most of the top ﬁve companies are afﬁliated with a commercial bank.

B. Measuring Risk-Adjusted Performance

We estimate a fund’s risk-adjusted returns (alphas) in U.S. dollars using
the Carhart (1997) four-factor model. Following Bekaert, Hodrick, and Zhang

(2009), we estimate four-factor alphas using regional factors based on a fund’s
investment region in the case of domestic, foreign country, and regional funds.
We use world factors in the case of global funds.13

13 We construct country-level factors using individual stock returns in U.S. dollars obtained
from Datastream, closely following the method of Fama and French (1993). The regional and world
factors are value-weighted averages of country factors. The regions are Asia Paciﬁc, Europe, North
America, Emerging, and World. Ferreira et al. (2013) provide a detailed description of the factors.

Figure 1. Market share of commercial bank-afﬁliated mutual funds. This ﬁgure shows
the number of funds (Panel A) and total net assets (Panel B) of commercial bank-afﬁliated and
unafﬁliated mutual funds by year. A fund is classiﬁed as bank-afﬁliated if the ultimate owner of
the fund’s management company is a commercial banking group. The sample consists of actively
managed domestic equity mutual funds over the 2000 to 2010 period. (Color ﬁgure can be viewed
at wileyonlinelibrary.com)

For each fund-quarter, we estimate factor loadings using the previous 36

months of return data (we require a minimum of 24 months of return data),

Ri,t = αi + β1iMKTi,t + β2iSMBi,t + β3iHMLi,t + β4iMOMi,t + εi,t,

(1)

where Ri,t is the return in U.S. dollars of fund i in month t in excess of the
one-month U.S. Treasury bill rate, MKTi,t (market) is the excess return in the
fund’s investment region in month t, SMBi,t (small minus big) is the average
return on the small-capitalization stock portfolio minus the average return on

the large-capitalization stock portfolio in the fund’s investment region, HMLi,t
(high minus low) is the difference between the return on the portfolio with
high book-to-market stocks and the return on the portfolio with low book-
to-market stocks in the fund’s investment region, and MOMi,t (momentum)
is the difference between the return on the portfolio with the past 12-month
stock winners and the return on the portfolio with the past 12-month stock
losers in the fund’s investment region. Using the estimated factor loadings, we
subtract the expected return from the realized fund return to obtain the fund’s
abnormal return in each quarter (alpha). In robustness checks, we instead use
benchmark-adjusted returns (i.e., the difference between the fund’s return and
the return on its benchmark), gross returns, buy-and-hold returns, and the
information ratio (i.e., the ratio of the alpha to the standard deviation of the
residuals).

C. Measuring Conﬂicts of Interest

We use several proxies for conﬂicts of interest within a commercial banking
group based on the relative importance of the lending and asset management
divisions. First, we use the ratio of the parent bank’s total loans outstanding to
the TNA managed by the asset management division (Loans/TNA).14 Second,
we use the ratio of the parent bank’s corporate and commercial loans outstand-
ing to the TNA (Corporate Loans/TNA). Finally, we use the ratio of the parent
bank’s interest income on loans to the total annual U.S. dollar value of the
asset management division’s fees (Interest Income/Fees).

To test the lending channel more directly, we use fund holdings data to ex-
amine whether the portfolio choices of bank-afﬁliated funds are biased toward
lending client stocks. We obtain data on funds’ portfolio holdings from the Fact-
Set database.15 We classify each fund’s holdings as a client stock or nonclient
stock using the DealScan database where we use all loans initiated between
1997 and 2010 with facility amounts above $25 million. A fund’s stock hold-
ing is classiﬁed as a “client stock” if the fund’s parent bank, subsidiary, or
branch acted as a lead arranger for loans of the ﬁrm in the previous three
years.

We construct several variables based on client stocks. First, we measure the
fund’s investment in client stocks as a percentage of TNA (%TNA Invested in
Client Stocks). Second, we measure whether a bank-afﬁliated fund overweights
client stocks compared to passive funds that track the same benchmark (Bias
in Client Stocks). Finally, we account for the intensity of the bank-ﬁrm lending
relationship by computing the prior two measures using only the holdings of
the top 10 borrowers of the parent bank in terms of the total dollar amount

14 TNA is given by the sum of open-end actively managed domestic equity funds managed by the
parent bank’s asset management divisions. We obtain similar estimates when we use TNA across
all funds.

15 Ferreira and Matos (2008) provide a detailed description of this database.

The ﬁrst of those funds is the DWS Investa Fund, which is managed by DWS
Investments. Deutsche Bank acted as a lead arranger in the syndicated loan
market over the 2008 to 2010 period for BASF, Siemens, Daimler, and E.ON,
which are among the top ﬁve holdings of DWS Investa Fund. Overall, 56.9% of
the fund’s TNA is invested in client stocks, which corresponds to an overweight
of 17.1 percentage points compared to passive funds that track the DAX 30
index.

The second example fund is the JPMorgan U.S. Equity Fund, which is man-
aged by JPMorgan Asset Management. Three of its top ﬁve holdings are clas-
siﬁed as client stocks for which JPMorgan acted as a lead arranger over the
previous three years. Overall, 40.4% of the fund’s TNA is invested in client
stocks, which corresponds to an overweight of 7.2 percentage points compared
to passive funds that track the S&P 500 index.

afﬁliated funds’ holdings are in client stocks, which is 5.9 percentage points
more than comparable passive funds hold in the same stocks.

Deutsche Bank is a good example of a commercial banking group with a
large asset management division, DWS Investments. Deutsche Bank was the
second-largest commercial bank worldwide in 2010, with total assets of over
$2.5 trillion (outstanding loans of $545 billion), and second in the league table
of syndicated loan arrangers in Europe, with $183 billion in 2008 to 2010. DWS
is the largest fund management company in Germany and the third largest in
Europe, with TNA of $90 billion in equity funds ($24 billion in domestic equity
funds) in 2010. Thus, Deutsche Bank’s lending business is several times the

size of its asset management business. When we examine fund holdings, we
ﬁnd that DWS’s equity holdings show a strong bias toward client stocks, with
25% of TNA invested in client stocks compared to 15% for comparable passive
funds.

A. Baseline Test

III. Results

We start by comparing the performance of management companies whose
parent’s primary activity is commercial banking and the performance of unaf-
ﬁliated fund management companies. Speciﬁcally, we estimate fund-quarter
panel regressions of four-factor alphas on the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated
dummy variable and a set of control variables (measured with a one-quarter
lag). The regressions control for different types of afﬁliation by including the
Insurance-Afﬁliated dummy variable for management companies that belong
to insurance groups and the Investment Bank-Afﬁliated dummy variable for
management companies that belong to investment banks. We also include the
Publicly Traded Parent dummy to control for spillover effects associated with
the listing of the parent company. The regressions further include quarter ﬁxed
effects and country-of-domicile ﬁxed effects. Standard errors are clustered at
the ultimate owner level.

The main results are reported in Panel A of Table III. Column (1) shows
that commercial bank-afﬁliated funds underperform unafﬁliated funds, as in-
dicated by the negative and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient on the Commercial Bank-
Afﬁliated dummy. The effect is economically signiﬁcant: bank-afﬁliated funds
underperform unafﬁliated funds by 23 basis points per quarter (or 92 ba-
sis points per year). The results also show that afﬁliation with commercial
banking groups is the most detrimental organizational arrangement for fund
performance.

Insurance-afﬁliated funds’ performance is in line with that of unafﬁliated
funds (i.e., the coefﬁcient on the Insurance-Afﬁliated dummy variable is sta-
tistically insigniﬁcant). Funds afﬁliated with ﬁnancial conglomerates with rel-
evant commercial and investment banking activity underperform unafﬁliated
funds by about 12.5 (−.125 = −0.231 + 0.106) basis points per quarter. These
ﬁndings on investment banks are consistent with conﬂicts of interest between
the underwriting business and the asset management division (Hao and Yan
(2012), Berzins, Liu, and Trzcinka (2013)).16

Fund management companies whose ultimate owners are publicly traded
perform similarly to companies whose ultimate owners are privately held. The
coefﬁcients on the remaining control variables are in line with other studies
that ﬁnd performance is negatively related to fund size and the total expense
ratio but positively related to family size and fund ﬂows (e.g., Chen et al. (2004),
P´astor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015)).

16 Most of the top investment banks (e.g., JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Barclays
Capital, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank) are also part of a wider ﬁnancial conglomerate that
earns signiﬁcant revenues from commercial banking.

Performance of Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated Funds

This table presents estimates of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of fund risk-adjusted
performance. Panel A presents results in which the dependent variable is the alpha from the
Carhart four-factor model in each quarter. Panel B presents results using alternative measures of
risk-adjusted performance. Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated is a dummy variable that takes a value of
1 if the ultimate owner of the fund’s management company is a commercial banking group, and 0
otherwise. All control variables are lagged by one period. Variable deﬁnitions are provided in Table
A.I in the Appendix. The sample consists of actively managed domestic equity mutual funds over
the 2000 to 2010 period. Robust t-statistics adjusted for clustering at the ultimate owner level are
reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level,
respectively.

An important concern with our baseline results is potential endogeneity.
We ﬁrst address endogeneity concerns using fund ﬁxed effects that control for
unobserved sources of fund heterogeneity. This solves the joint determination
problem whereby an unobserved time-invariant fund-level variable determines
both performance and the decision to operate a fund management company in
a commercial banking group. This test is equivalent to looking only at within-
fund changes in the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated dummy (i.e., divestitures or
acquisitions of asset management divisions by commercial banking groups in
which the other party is not a banking group).

Column (2) of Table III reports estimates of fund ﬁxed effects regressions.
The afﬁliated funds’ underperformance gap relative to unafﬁliated funds is 38
basis points per quarter, which is stronger than the estimate in column (1). The
fund ﬁxed effects speciﬁcation indicates that fund performance improves after
a switch from afﬁliated to unafﬁliated, while fund performance deteriorates
after a switch from unafﬁliated to afﬁliated.

To investigate further why bank-afﬁliated funds underperform, we alterna-
tively add to our baseline speciﬁcation the logarithm of one plus Loans/TNA,
Corporate Loans/TNA, or Interest Income/Fees, which measure the size of the
lending division relative to the asset management division within a banking
group. Columns (3) to (5) show negative and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁ-
cients on these three variables. Moreover, the coefﬁcient on the Commercial
Bank-Afﬁliated dummy becomes statistically insigniﬁcant, which suggests
that most of the underperformance of afﬁliated funds is explained by the size
of the lending business. The effect is economically signiﬁcant. For example,

The Journal of Finance R(cid:3)

funds afﬁliated with commercial banks with lending divisions of relative size
close to zero underperform unafﬁliated funds by 9 basis points per quarter,
while funds afﬁliated with commercial banks with lending divisions of median
relative size (i.e., ratio of Loans/TNA of 22.75) underperform unafﬁliated
funds by 25 basis points.

Panel B reports estimates of the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated coefﬁcient us-
ing alternative measures of risk-adjusted performance. Column (1) shows that
the results are robust to using benchmark-adjusted returns as an alternative
to four-factor alphas—the extent of the underperformance remains practically
unchanged at 20 basis points per quarter. Banks’ larger foothold in fund dis-
tribution may allow afﬁliated funds to charge higher fees, which might be an
alternative explanation for the underperformance of afﬁliated funds. Column
(2) shows that bank-afﬁliated funds underperform unafﬁliated funds when
gross returns are used as the dependent variable, with the performance gap
remaining virtually unchanged at 22 basis points per quarter. Thus, the abil-
ity of bank-afﬁliated funds to charge higher expense ratios does not explain
their underperformance. In column (3), we consider funds’ buy-and-hold re-
turn in excess of the benchmark return, as the performance gap could come
from higher loads, wrap fees, or other hidden costs. We ﬁnd that bank-afﬁliated
funds underperform unafﬁliated funds by a similar difference of 17 basis points
per quarter. Finally, in column (4), we account for differences in idiosyncratic
risk across funds using the information ratio as a performance measure. The
idea here is that, as a portfolio deviates from the benchmark, it will be exposed
to greater idiosyncratic risk. The results are robust to using the information
ratio as a performance measure.

We also explore the time-series variation of our results by analyzing the
bank-afﬁliated funds’ performance gap in market downturns as proxied by (1)
a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 in bear markets (2000:Q1 to 2002:Q3
and 2007:Q4 to 2009:Q1), (2) the market return of a fund’s investment region
(Asia Paciﬁc, Europe, North America, and Emerging), and (3) a dummy vari-
able that takes a value of 1 during NBER recessions periods (any quarter that
includes at least one month classiﬁed as a recession month). The estimates in
Table IA.II in the Internet Appendix show that the underperformance of
afﬁliated funds is more pronounced during market downturns when we expect
a bank’s balance sheet to suffer from deterioration in the valuation of borrower
ﬁrms.

B. Cross-Country Variation

Our sample of funds domiciled in 28 countries allows us to examine cross-
country differences in the performance of commercial bank-afﬁliated funds.
We consider several country characteristics that can help explain the under-
performance of afﬁliated funds. Table IV reports the results. First, we compare
the underperformance of afﬁliated funds in the United States relative to other
countries. The intuition is that “Chinese walls” between bank lending and as-
set management are more strictly enforced in the United States because of

Performance of Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated Funds:

Cross-Country Differences

Table IV

This table presents estimates of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of fund risk-adjusted
performance. The dependent variable is the alpha from the Carhart four-factor model in each
quarter. Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the ultimate
owner of the fund’s management company is a commercial banking group, and 0 otherwise. In
columns (1) and (2), the non-U.S. and U.S. fund groups consist of those funds domiciled outside
of the United States and domiciled in the United States. In columns (3) and (4), the civil and
common-law fund groups consist of those funds domiciled in civil-law and common-law countries
as deﬁned in La Porta et al. (1998). In columns (5) and (6), the bank- and market-based fund groups
consist of those funds domiciled in bank- and market-based countries as deﬁned in Demirg ¨uc¸-
Kunt and Levine (2001). In columns (7) and (8), the high and low bank concentration groups
consist of those funds domiciled in countries that are above and below the 75th percentile of the
distribution of the market share of the top ﬁve banks. In columns (9) and (10), the high- and
low-fund management company concentration groups consist of those funds domiciled in countries
that are above and below the 75th percentile of the distribution of the market share of the top ﬁve
fund management companies. In columns (11) and (12), the low and high approvals fund groups
consist of those funds domiciled in countries that have one and more than one regulatory approval
and disclosure requirements in the fund industry as deﬁned in Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano
(2005). The regressions include the same control variables (coefﬁcients not shown) as in Table III.
All control variables are lagged by one period. Variable deﬁnitions are provided in Table A.I in
the Appendix. The sample consists of actively managed domestic equity mutual funds over the
2000 to 2010 period. Robust t-statistics adjusted for clustering at the ultimate owner level are
reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level,

the legacy effect of the Glass-Steagal Act, and hence fund investors’ rights are
better protected (Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano (2005, 2009)). In columns (1)
and (2), we ﬁnd much less pronounced underperformance among U.S.-afﬁliated
funds (17 basis points per quarter) than among non-U.S. afﬁliated funds (33 ba-
sis points per quarter). This performance difference is statistically signiﬁcant.
Second, we compare the performance gap of afﬁliated funds in countries with
civil-law legal origin versus countries with common-law legal origin (La Porta
et al. (1998)). In columns (3) and (4) of Table IV, we ﬁnd that the underperfor-
mance of afﬁliated funds is more pronounced in civil-law countries (32 basis
points per quarter) than in common-law countries (19 basis points per quar-
ter). Taken together, the non-U.S. versus U.S. results as well as the legal origin
results suggest that conﬂicts of interest are less pronounced in markets with
stronger laws and regulations.

Third, we compare the performance gap of afﬁliated funds in countries with
bank-based ﬁnancial systems versus countries with market-based ﬁnancial
systems (Demirg ¨uc¸-Kunt and Levine (2001)). The conﬂicts of interest between
lending and asset management divisions should be exacerbated in countries
where ﬁrms are more bank-dependent and rely less on markets to raise capital.
In columns (5) and (6), we ﬁnd that the underperformance of afﬁliated funds
is more pronounced in bank-based countries (31 basis points per quarter) than
in market-based countries (20 basis points per quarter).

Fourth, we compare the performance gap of afﬁliated funds in countries
with low versus high banking industry concentration as proxied by the mar-
ket share of the top ﬁve banks (Beck, Demirg ¨uc¸-Kunt, and Levine (2000)). We
expect that conﬂicts of interest are more pronounced in countries with higher
banking concentration. In columns (7) and (8), we ﬁnd that the underperfor-
mance of afﬁliated funds is more pronounced in the high banking industry
concentration group (41 basis points per quarter) than in the low banking in-
dustry concentration group (20 basis points per quarter). This performance
difference is statistically signiﬁcant.

Fifth, we compare the performance gap of afﬁliated funds in countries with
low versus high mutual fund industry concentration as proxied by the market

share of the top ﬁve fund management companies. In columns (9) and (10),
we ﬁnd that the underperformance of afﬁliated funds is more pronounced in
the high concentration group (33 basis points per quarter) than in the low con-
centration group (17 basis points per quarter), with the difference statistically
signiﬁcant.

Finally, we compare the performance gap of afﬁliated funds in countries
with low versus high requirements with regard to regulatory approvals and
disclosure (Approvals) in the fund industry (Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano
(2005)). In columns (11) and (12) of Table IV, we ﬁnd that the underperformance
of afﬁliated funds is more pronounced in the low Approvals group (31 basis
points per quarter) than in the high Approvals group (23 basis points per
quarter).

Overall, the results suggest that better investor protection, a stricter regu-
latory environment, and more intense competition in the banking and mutual
fund industry mitigate conﬂicts of interest between the lending and asset man-
agement divisions of commercial banking groups.

C. Client Stock Overweighting

We use fund portfolio holdings data to test more directly whether fund man-
ager investment decisions favor the parent bank’s lending business over fund
investors’ interests. In particular, we examine the cost of the portfolio’s expo-
sure to lending-client stocks.

Panel C of Table II shows that bank-afﬁliated funds hold on average 14.7%
of the fund’s TNA in client stocks (%TNA Invested in Client Stocks). In com-
parison, the average weight in the same stocks among passive funds that track
the same benchmark is 8.8%. This corresponds to a 5.9 percentage point over-
weight of client stocks by afﬁliated funds relative to comparable passive funds
(Bias in Client Stocks). The overweight in client stocks is 0.22 percentage points
when we consider the top 10 borrowers of the fund’s parent bank (Bias in Top
10 Client Stocks).17

The fact that fund managers’ allocations are biased toward client stocks
does not necessarily imply that these portfolio choices are detrimental to
performance, as funds might have access to private information obtained
from the parent’s bank lending business. To test whether the conﬂict of
interest hypothesis or the information advantage hypothesis dominates, we
estimate our baseline regressions of fund performance using measures based
on portfolio holdings.

We use four dummy variables to capture the extent to which a fund’s holdings
overweight client stocks. We deﬁne High Allocation Fund as a dummy that
takes a value of 1 if the fund’s %TNA Invested in Client Stocks is above the me-
dian in each country and quarter, and High Bias Fund as a dummy that takes a
value of 1 if the fund’s Bias in Client Stocks is above the median in each country

17 Table IA.III in the Internet Appendix shows that afﬁliated funds overweight client stocks

using fund-stock-quarter regression tests.

and quarter. We similarly deﬁne two dummy variables High Allocation Fund
in Top 10 Client Stocks and High Bias Fund in Top 10 Client Stocks based on
holdings in the top 10 clients. In the regressions, the coefﬁcient on Commercial
Bank-Afﬁliated is an estimate of the difference in the performance between
funds with low exposure to client stocks and unafﬁliated funds. Similarly, the
coefﬁcients on High Allocation Fund and High Bias Fund provide estimates of
the difference in the performance between funds with high exposure to client
stocks and funds with low exposure to client stocks, and therefore the degree
to which fund performance is affected by conﬂicts of interest with the lending
division.

Table V presents the results. Columns (1) and (2) show negative and sta-
tistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcients on the High Bias Fund and High Bias Fund
in Top 10 Client Stocks dummy variables. The effects are also economically
signiﬁcant. For example, using the estimates in column (1), afﬁliated funds
with low overweight of client stocks underperform unafﬁliated funds by about
20 basis points per quarter. In addition, afﬁliated funds with high overweight of
client stocks underperform afﬁliated funds with low overweight of client stocks
by about 12 basis points, which indicates that they underperform unafﬁliated
funds by 32 basis points. These estimates therefore indicate that the exposure
to client stocks represents about 40% of the underperformance of afﬁliated
funds.

Columns (3) and (4) show negative and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcients
on the High Allocation Fund and High Allocation Fund in Top 10 Client Stocks
dummy variables. The effects are again economically signiﬁcant. For example,
afﬁliated funds with low exposure to client stocks underperform unafﬁliated
funds by 17.5 basis points per quarter. In addition, afﬁliated funds with high
exposure to client stocks underperform afﬁliated funds with low exposure to
client stocks by 16 basis points, which indicates that they underperform unaf-
ﬁliated funds by 33.5 basis points.

We also compare the effect on fund performance of overweighting client stocks
for the sample of non-U.S. funds and U.S. funds separately. Columns (5) and (6)
present estimates using the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated and High Bias Fund
dummy variables. We ﬁnd that the High Bias Fund coefﬁcient is negative and
signiﬁcant in the sample of non-U.S. funds but statistically insigniﬁcant in the
sample of U.S. funds. This is consistent with the idea that the underperfor-
mance of non-U.S. afﬁliated funds is related to the extent of the portfolio’s tilt
toward client stocks. For the sample of U.S. funds, however, the performance
gap of commercial bank-afﬁliated funds is unrelated to the fund’s exposure to
client stocks.

Overall, the evidence indicates that commercial bank-afﬁliated funds with
greater portfolio exposure and overweighting of client stocks tend to underper-
form more, which is line with the conﬂict of interest hypothesis.18

18 We also investigate whether afﬁliated funds would have performed better had they chosen
to invest in other client stocks held by their peer funds (Client Stocks Not Held). The results in
Table IA.IV in the Internet Appendix show that bank-afﬁliated funds are more biased toward

Performance of Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated Funds and Portfolio

Allocation to Client Stocks

This table presents estimates of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of fund risk-adjusted
performance. The dependent variable is the alpha from the Carhart four-factor model in each
quarter. Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the ultimate
owner of the fund’s management company is a commercial banking group, and 0 otherwise. High
Bias Fund is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if an afﬁliated fund Bias in Client Stocks
is above the median in a given country and quarter, and 0 otherwise. Bias in Client Stocks is
the portfolio bias in stocks of ﬁrms that borrow from the fund’s parent bank versus the average
weight of comparable passive funds. High Allocation Fund is a dummy variable that takes a value
of 1 if an afﬁliated fund %TNA Invested in Client Stocks is above the median in a given country
and quarter, and 0 otherwise. %TNA Invested in Client Stocks is the percentage of TNA invested
in stocks of ﬁrms that borrow from the fund’s parent bank. High Bias Fund in Top 10 Client
Stocks and High Allocation Fund in Top 10 Client Stocks are dummy variables similarly deﬁned
for the top 10 borrowers of the fund’s parent bank. All of these variables are set to zero if the fund
is unafﬁliated. The regressions include the same control variables (coefﬁcients not shown) as in
Table III. All control variables are lagged by one period. Variable deﬁnitions are provided in Table
A.I in the Appendix. The sample consists of actively managed domestic equity mutual funds over
the 2000 to 2010 period. Robust t-statistics adjusted for clustering at the ultimate owner level are

D. Robustness Checks

Table IA.V in the Internet Appendix presents additional robustness checks
of our primary ﬁnding that commercial bank-afﬁliated funds underperform
unafﬁliated funds. First, we use alternative estimation methods such as Fama
and MacBeth (1973) and weighted least squares (WLS) using fund TNA as

poorer-performing client stocks within the investable universe of stocks of their bank’s lending
clients.

weights. Columns (1) and (2) show that these alternative estimation meth-
ods provide estimates of the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated coefﬁcient that are
comparable to the baseline results in Table III. Second, we check for the sensi-
tivity of the estimates to the inclusion of small funds and earlier sample years
with lower coverage of the population of funds. Columns (3) and (4) indicate
that the results are robust to excluding funds with assets under management
below $10 million or to excluding the ﬁrst two years of the sample (2000 to
2001). Third, we check the robustness to controlling for the fund’s Active Share
(Cremers and Petajisto (2009), Cremers et al. (2016)), a proxy for manage-
rial skill. This test alleviates concerns that bank-afﬁliated funds might hire
less-skilled fund managers. The estimate of the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated
coefﬁcient, reported in column (5), is similar to that in Table III, which indi-
cates that our results are not driven by systematic differences in fund manager
skills between afﬁliated and unafﬁliated funds. Finally, we repeat our base-
line test using a sample of passive funds run by bank-afﬁliated fund manage-
ment companies. We should not ﬁnd signiﬁcant conﬂicts of interest stemming
from lending activity in the case of passive funds that have little discretion
to overweight client stocks. In line with this prediction, column (6) shows
that bank-afﬁliated passive funds do not underperform unafﬁliated passive
funds.

We also check whether subadvisory arrangements across the different com-
plexes affect our primary ﬁndings. Speciﬁcally, following the methodology in
Chuprinin, Massa, and Schumacher (2015), we identify funds that are man-
aged in an outsourcing relationship. We then repeat our baseline performance
tests either (1) by restricting the sample to funds managed in-house and (2) by
including a dummy variable for outsourced funds as a control. Table IA.VI of
the Internet Appendix shows that the results are similar to those presented in
Table III.

IV. Endogeneity

An important concern with our baseline results is endogeneity. A ﬁrst con-
cern is omitted variable bias, which we address using fund ﬁxed effects in
Table III. A second concern is reverse causality. Strong past performance may
prompt a fund management company to operate as unafﬁliated, while poorly
performing funds may not be able to operate as unafﬁliated. Another concern
is the possibility that commercial bank-afﬁliated funds may have less-skilled
managers. We address these issues using several empirical strategies.

A. Divestitures of Asset Management Divisions

To strengthen the causal interpretation of our results, we exploit the varia-
tion in commercial bank afﬁliation generated by a quasi-natural experiment.
Speciﬁcally, we use asset management division divestitures by commercial
banking groups to identify changes in bank afﬁliation that are exogenous to
fund performance. We employ a difference-in-differences regression using the

three quarters before and the three quarters after the announcement quarter
of a fund divestiture by a commercial banking group (treated funds). The sam-
ple includes 22 divestitures by 19 commercial banks for a total of 132 funds
managed by companies sold by commercial banks to unafﬁliated companies
during the 2000 to 2010 period.19

We ﬁrst isolate treated funds. Then, from the population of nontreated (un-
afﬁliated) funds, we look for control funds that minimize the (Mahalanobis)
distance between a vector of observed covariates (pre-event) across treated and
nontreated funds. We select one matched control fund for each treated fund.
The matching estimator produces exact matches on categorical variables but
less exact matches on continuous variables (although they should be close). The
categorical variables include country and investment objective. The noncate-
gorical variables (measured one quarter before the event) include TNA, Family
TNA, and prior year Average Performance (i.e., average four-factor alpha over
the previous four quarters).

Panel A of Table VI reports results for equality of means and medians tests
between the treatment and control groups. In general, we cannot reject the
hypothesis of equal means or medians on the matching covariates between the
treatment and control groups.

We estimate difference-in-differences regressions to examine whether funds’
portfolio holdings of client stocks and performance change after a management
company switches from afﬁliated to unafﬁliated. In the case of the portfolio
holdings tests, for each treated fund, we compute %TNA Invested in Client
Stocks using the pre-event list of client stocks of the parent bank with which
the fund management company was afﬁliated before the event. For each control
fund, we compute its allocation to client stocks using the same pre-event list of
client stocks of the treated fund. The main explanatory variables are a dummy
variable that takes a value of 1 if the fund is sold by a commercial bank to an
unafﬁliated company (Treated), a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 in
the quarter of the divestiture and thereafter (After), and the interaction term
Treated × After.20

Panel B of Table VI reports the results. Columns (1) and (2) report es-
timates for the sample of divestitures during the 2000 to 2010 period.
Column (1) shows that fund managers signiﬁcantly reduce their stock hold-
ings of clients of the parent bank after a switch from afﬁliated to unafﬁliated
relative to control funds. On average, the holdings of client stocks (%TNA In-
vested in Client Stocks) in treated funds decline by 2.4 percentage points more
(t-statistic = −4.75) than control funds following a divestiture.21 Column (2)

19 The events are identiﬁed by combining information from several sources including FactSet,

SDC Platinum, and web searches of press releases.

20 The Treated dummy variable captures the difference in %TNA Invested in Client Stocks
between the treated fund and the control fund in the same stock holding, which corresponds to the
bias variables in Table V as treated and control funds share the same benchmark.

21 We repeat our difference-in-differences regressions using the fund benchmark weights (in-
stead of the nearest-neighbor fund) as controls. The results reported in Table IA.VII in the Internet
Appendix are similar to those presented in Table VI.

shows that treated funds’ Average Performance improves by 41 basis points
more (t-statistic = 4.30) than control funds following a divestiture (the post-
treatment period).

Columns (3) and (4) report estimates when we restrict the sample to the
2007 to 2009 global ﬁnancial crisis (2007:Q3 to 2009:Q2). During this pe-
riod, several commercial banking groups were forced to divest noncore busi-
ness assets to improve their regulatory capital ratios rather than due to
factors such as fund performance.22 Some high-proﬁle deals include the di-
vestitures of the asset management division of Credit Suisse to Aberdeen, of
Barclays Global Investors to Blackrock, and of Cominvest (Commerzbank) to
Allianz. The results are similar to those in columns (1) and (2). Speciﬁcally,
we ﬁnd that the differential effect on portfolio holdings of client stocks is 3.0
percentage points, and the differential effect on performance is a positive 35
basis points.

As we discuss above, a potential concern with our results is that commer-
cial bank-afﬁliated funds may hire less-skilled managers. This could occur if
talented managers view stand-alone management companies as offering more
prestigious career paths or if afﬁliated funds have less of an incentive to attract
talent because banks can offer bundled services to clients. If afﬁliated funds
hire less-skilled managers, then when an asset management arm is spun off,
the new stand-alone entity may have to switch to a talent-based model by
replacing fund managers. To mitigate this concern, we restrict the sample of
divestitures to funds that do not experience fund manager turnover (i.e., man-
ager skill remains constant) around divestitures. Columns (5) and (6) report
the results for the 2000 to 2010 period, which are similar to those in columns
(1) to (4). Speciﬁcally, treated funds signiﬁcantly reduce their portfolio hold-
ings of client stocks by 2.7 percentage points relative to control funds after a
divestiture. In addition, the differential effect on performance is positive at 38
basis points and statistically signiﬁcant. These results suggest that differences
in manager skill do not explain our results.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of differences in holdings of client stocks (%TNA
Invested in Client Stocks) and fund performance (Average Performance) be-
tween the treatment and control groups over the two quarters before and af-
ter a divestiture of an asset management company by a commercial banking
group during the 2000 to 2010 period (Panel A) and during the 2007 to 2009
global ﬁnancial crisis (Panel B). This ﬁgure is based on the estimation with
the treatment variable (Treated) interacted with event quarter dummies. The
divestitures occur between quarter −1 and quarter 0. The ﬁgure shows that the
two groups follow parallel trends in the pretreatment period. A switch from af-
ﬁliated to unafﬁliated is accompanied by signiﬁcant reductions in the holdings
of client stocks. There is also evidence of an improvement in fund performance
following divestitures.

Figure 2. Funds’ client stock holdings and performance around divestitures. This ﬁgure
shows commercial bank-afﬁliated funds’ portfolio holdings of client stocks and performance around
divestitures of fund management companies in the 2000 to 2010 (Panel A) and 2007 to 2009
global ﬁnancial crisis (Panel B) periods. %TNA Invested in Client Stocks is the percentage of
TNA invested in stocks of ﬁrms that borrow from the fund’s parent bank. Average Performance
is the average four-factor alpha over the last four quarters. The sample of divestitures includes
funds of management companies afﬁliated with commercial banking groups that are sold to stand-
alone management companies. The divestitures occur between quarter −1 and quarter 0. The
sample consists of actively managed domestic equity mutual funds. (Color ﬁgure can be viewed at

B. Calendar-Time Portfolio Return Tests

To further rule out alternative channels, we use a calendar-time portfolio
approach to study the performance of afﬁliated funds in the trading of client and
nonclient stock holdings. In these tests, we compare manager skill for afﬁliated
funds with regard to two groups of holdings—client stocks and nonclient stocks.
If fund managers face conﬂicts of interest with the lending division, then the
client stocks that a fund buys should underperform the client stocks that the
fund sells. In addition, the nonclient stocks that a fund buys should perform
similarly to the nonclient stocks that the fund sells. Notice that signiﬁcant

Table VII

Calendar-Time Portfolio Returns on Buys Minus Sells of Client and

Nonclient Stocks

This table presents risk-adjusted monthly portfolio returns of the client stocks a fund buys and
sells, deﬁned as the portfolio of client stocks (i.e., ﬁrms that borrow from the fund’s parent bank)
held by bank-afﬁliated funds that had an increase or decrease in the number of shares held in the
previous quarter, respectively. Portfolio returns of the nonclient stocks a fund buys and sells are
deﬁned similarly. Every quarter in the 2000 to 2010 period, each fund’s portfolio holdings are split
into a client portfolio and a nonclient portfolio. These two portfolios are further subdivided into a
buy portfolio and a sell portfolio. We calculate the average portfolio return across funds in each
month weighted by TNA, and then the return of the portfolio of stocks bought minus sold in each
month. Returns are risk-adjusted using the Carhart four-factor model with global factors. The high
and low bias fund groups consist of those funds that are above and below the median of the Bias
in Client Stocks variable in a given country and quarter. The sample consists of actively managed
domestic equity mutual funds that are afﬁliated with commercial banking groups over the 2000
to 2010 period. Robust t-statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical
signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

underperformance for both client and nonclient stocks would indicate that
afﬁliated fund managers have less skill than unafﬁliated fund managers.23

We compute the value-weighted monthly portfolio return in quarter t of
client stocks in which a fund increased its holdings (in terms of number of
shares) in quarter t−1. Similarly, we calculate the return to a portfolio of client
stocks in which holdings decreased in quarter t−1. We average returns across
funds in each month weighted by TNA. Next, we compute the average return
of the client stocks bought minus the client stocks sold in each month, and the
corresponding risk-adjusted return using Carhart (1997) four-factor alphas
with global factors. We follow the same steps to compute the risk-adjusted
performance of the nonclient stocks bought and sold, and compare performance
on client stocks relative to nonclient stocks.

Table VII reports the average monthly four-factor alpha of client stocks and
nonclient stocks bought minus sold. Column (1) shows that client stocks bought
underperform client stocks sold by 11.5 basis points per month, which is sta-
tistically insigniﬁcant. The nonclient stock portfolio return (buys minus sells)
is positive and statistically insigniﬁcant. The difference in portfolio returns
between client stocks and nonclient stocks is −15 basis points but statistically

stocks that the fund buys should outperform the client stocks that the fund sells.

insigniﬁcant. The estimate indicates that the exposure to client stocks repre-
sents about 30% of the average underperformance of bank-afﬁliated funds.24

The source of the underperformance in the trading of client stocks is related
to the decision to overweight client stocks. We therefore expect the underper-
formance in the trading of client stocks to be concentrated in the group of
afﬁliated funds that overweight client stocks to a greater extent (High Bias
Funds). In addition, we do not expect to ﬁnd underperformance in the group
of afﬁliated funds with low bias in client stocks (Low Bias Funds). Column (2)
shows that client stocks bought signiﬁcantly underperform client stocks sold
by 23 basis points in the group of High Bias Funds, while column (3) shows
that client stocks bought outperform client stocks sold by 17 basis points in
the group of Low Bias Funds. In the case of nonclient stocks, the alphas are
neither statistically nor economically signiﬁcant. The difference in portfolio
returns between client and nonclient stocks is signiﬁcant at −27 basis points
in the group of High Bias Funds and statistically insigniﬁcant in the group of
Low Bias Funds. The estimate for the group of High Bias Funds indicates that
the exposure to client stocks (23.8% of the fund’s TNA on average) represents
about 60% of the underperformance among afﬁliated funds that overweight
client stocks to a greater extent. These results are consistent with the idea
that manager skill is similar in afﬁliated and unafﬁliated funds, and thus the
skill hypothesis does not explain the underperformance of afﬁliated funds.

We also examine the performance of client stocks bought and sold during
bear market periods in the group of High Bias Funds. We ﬁnd that client stocks
bought signiﬁcantly underperform client stocks sold by 50 basis points, while
nonclient stock portfolio returns are statistically insigniﬁcant. The difference
in portfolio returns between client stocks and nonclient stocks is −64 basis
points (t-statistic = −2.55) in bear markets, while the difference is statistically
insigniﬁcant in bull markets. We conclude that the underperformance in client
stocks is driven by market downturns, when a bank’s balance sheet would
suffer most from deterioration in the pricing of loans.

To shed light on the reason behind the performance gap of bank-afﬁliated
funds on client stocks, we examine the trading activity of afﬁliated fund man-
agers on client stocks and nonclient stocks. Table IA.VIII in the Internet
Appendix reports estimates of a fund-stock-quarter regression of fund hold-
ing turnover on the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated dummy variable and a Client
Stock dummy variable, which takes a value of 1 if the stock holding is from
a fund’s parent bank lending client. We ﬁnd that bank-afﬁliated funds trade
signiﬁcantly more frequently in client stocks than in nonclient stocks.

We also examine the behavior of afﬁliated funds when they are more valu-
able to lending clients, for example, when the lending clients experience a

24 Bank-afﬁliated funds underperform by 15 basis points in the trading of client stocks versus
nonclient stocks using the estimate in column (1) of Table VII. Since these funds hold, on average,
14.7% of the TNA in client stocks, this implies that the underperformance due to this channel
is 26 basis points per year (= 15 × 14.7% × 12). This corresponds to about 30% of the average
underperformance of bank-afﬁliated funds.

negative shock. Following Cohen and Schmidt (2009), we look at downward
price pressure events caused by widespread selling of client stock using the
dummy variable %Comp Sold>1, which takes a value of 1 when more than
1% of the shares outstanding of a stock are sold in aggregate by all funds in a
quarter (excluding funds from the own-management company). Table IA.IX in
the Internet Appendix reports estimates of a fund-stock-quarter regression of
the logarithm of fund holding ownership on the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated,
Client Stock, and %Comp Sold>1 dummy variables. We ﬁnd that afﬁliated
funds increase their ownership of client stocks in periods of high selling pres-
sure by other funds, as indicated by the positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient on
Client Stock × %Comp Sold>1. This effect is economically signiﬁcant, as bank-
afﬁliated funds increase their holdings in client stocks by about 3% more than
in nonclient stocks following a negative shock. This is consistent with the idea
that afﬁliated funds provide price support during negative shocks, which biases
their portfolios toward poorer-performing client stocks. These results suggest
that afﬁliated fund managers act as liquidity providers for client stocks, which
leads to higher turnover and poorer performance in their client stock’s portfolio
holdings.

C. Placebo Tests

As a placebo test of our baseline regressions, we use a sample of international
equity funds (i.e., funds that invest outside their local market). We expect
relationship lending to be less important, and arm’s-length (i.e., transactional)
lending to be more important, in the international syndicated loan market than
in the domestic market.

Table IA.X reports the estimates for the sample of international funds.
Column (1) shows less of a pronounced performance gap of bank-afﬁliated
funds relative to unafﬁliated funds in the sample of international funds (11
basis points per quarter) than in the sample of domestic funds (23 basis points,
as shown in Table III). Columns (2) and (3) show estimates of regressions that
include the High Bias Fund or High Allocation Fund dummy variables. While
international funds afﬁliated with a commercial banking group underperform
unafﬁliated funds, this underperformance is not driven by conﬂicts of interest
with the lending division since the coefﬁcients on both the High Bias Fund
and High Allocation Fund dummies are statistically insigniﬁcant. Note that
these same coefﬁcients are statistically signiﬁcant in the sample of domestic
funds in Table V. These results are consistent with fund managers’ portfolio
choices in international funds being less distorted by lending relationships,
as conﬂicts of interest should be more important for domestic borrowers than
foreign borrowers.

V. Equilibrium

In this section, we provide evidence that the decision to favor the stock of
the bank’s lending clients beneﬁts various agents (the parent bank, the fund

 15406261, 2018, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12702 by KIZ der Universitat Ulm, Wiley Online Library on [20/11/2024].

manager, and the borrowing ﬁrm’s managers). We also provide evidence that
investors of bank-afﬁliated funds exhibit inertia, as ﬂows have low sensitivity to
poor performance, which explains why afﬁliated funds hold signiﬁcant market
shares despite their inferior performance.

A. Beneﬁts to the Bank

We examine the trade-off between the lending and asset management di-
visions when the parent bank uses its afﬁliated funds to support its lend-
ing business by overweighting client stocks. On the one hand, this biased
portfolio allocation may impose a cost as afﬁliated funds may underperform
their peers (i.e., funds that track the same benchmark) and therefore ex-
perience signiﬁcant outﬂows and erosion of fees. On the other hand, us-
ing fund resources may help build long-term relationships with borrowers
and increase the likelihood of the bank acting as a lead arranger of future
loans.

To test for potential beneﬁts to the banking group, we examine whether
bank-afﬁliated fund holdings in client stocks make it more likely that the bank
will be chosen as a lead arranger for future loans of the same borrower ﬁrm.
We perform this test following the methodology in Bharath et al. (2007) and
Ferreira and Matos (2012). Speciﬁcally, for each loan facility, we pair ﬁrms with
each of the top 20 banks in a country in terms of syndicated loan volume in
U.S. dollars. We then estimate a logit model in which the dependent variable is
a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the bank acted as a lead arranger,
and 0 otherwise.

Table VIII reports the results. The estimates in column (1) indicate that
banks tend to arrange more loans for ﬁrms in which their afﬁliated funds hold
stock (Client Stock Holding). On average, banks with afﬁliated fund holdings
in borrowers are 3.2% more likely to be chosen as lead arrangers than banks
without afﬁliated fund holdings in borrowers (the probability increases from
12.6% to 15.8%). The relative importance of afﬁliated fund holdings in increas-
ing the bank’s lending business depends on whether or not the bank has a
past lending relationship (over the past three years) with the borrower. For
new lending relationships, afﬁliated fund holdings in the borrower increase
the likelihood that the bank will act as a lead arranger by 2.6% (from 9.4% to
12%); for past lending relationships, banks are 6.6% more likely to act as lead
arrangers (from 41.3% to 47.9%).

The probability that the bank acts as a lead arranger should increase with
the size of the afﬁliated fund holdings in the borrower. To test this con-
jecture, we repeat our analysis using a dummy that takes a value of 1 if
the bank’s afﬁliated funds together hold at least 1% of the borrower ﬁrm’s
shares (Client Stock Holdings>1%). The results in column (2) show that, on
average, banks with afﬁliated fund holdings in a borrower of at least 1% of
shares outstanding are 4.5% more likely to be chosen as lead arrangers than
other banks. While for new relationships, the probability of being chosen as
lead bank increases by 3.5%, for past lending clients, it increases by 8.4%.

Table VIII

Probability of Getting Future Lending Business and Client

Stock Holdings

This table presents estimates of logit regressions of whether the existence of a bank-ﬁrm(i, j) link
through bank-afﬁliated funds’ portfolio holdings prior to the loan affects the probability that ﬁrm
(borrower) j chooses bank i as a lead arranger in the syndicated loan market. For each facility, there
is a choice set of 20 potential lead arrangers (top 20 ranked by U.S. dollar volume of syndicated
loans in each country). The dependent variable is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if
bank i acted as a lead arranger, and 0 otherwise. Client Stock Holding is a dummy variable that
takes the value of 1 if the funds afﬁliated with bank i hold stock of the ﬁrm at the end of the
previous year, and 0 otherwise. Client Stock Holding>1% is a dummy that takes the value of 1
if the funds afﬁliated with bank i hold at least 1% of the ﬁrm’s shares outstanding at the end
of the previous year, and 0 otherwise. Bank Market Share is the fraction of bank i of the U.S.
dollar volume of syndicated loans in each country. Lending Relationship is a dummy that takes the
value of 1 if ﬁrm j chose bank i as a lead arranger in a loan over the past three years. Firm-level
controls include stock market capitalization (log), book-to-market ratio, leverage, tangibility, stock
volatility, and stock return (coefﬁcients not shown). All control variables are lagged by one period.
Variable deﬁnitions are provided in Table A.I in the Appendix. The sample consists of syndicated
loans by publicly listed borrowers over the 2000 to 2010 period. Robust t-statistics adjusted for
clustering at the ﬁrm and bank levels are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical

Columns (3) and (4) show that the results are robust to including bank (lender)-
speciﬁc controls (assets, return on assets); bank ﬁxed effects; ﬁrm (borrower)-
speciﬁc controls (market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, leverage, tangi-
bility, stock volatility, and stock return); and ﬁrm-country and industry ﬁxed
effects.

B. Beneﬁts to the Lending Client

Commercial banks may use afﬁliated funds to boost their voting rights and
thus increase inﬂuence over the borrower’s board of directors. This inﬂuence
could help build long-term relationships that lead to future loan business.
In this case, we would expect afﬁliated funds to systematically overweight
client stocks to curry favor with the borrower’s management. To examine this
hypothesis, we estimate a ﬁrm-level regression of voting dissent in executive
compensation proposals on ownership by funds afﬁliated with banks that acted
as lead arrangers over the previous three years.

The sample consists of ﬁrms from 17 countries for which voting records are
available in Institutional Shareholder Services/RiskMetrics (ISS) over the 2008
to 2010 period.25 The great majority of proposals are management sponsored,
and there is close to 100% approval in routine issues, with the exception of
those related to executive compensation (i.e., votes on option plans, repricing
of options, restricted stock, bonuses, and loans). We focus our analysis on voting
dissent, deﬁned as the percentage of votes against management’s recommen-
dation on compensation plans.

Table IX reports the results. The results in column (1) show that ownership
by funds afﬁliated with lenders reduces voting dissent in proposals related
to executive compensation at shareholder meetings, as indicated by the neg-
ative and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient on Lender-Afﬁliated Funds Ownership. How-
ever, ownership by funds afﬁliated with banks that have not acted as lead
arrangers for the ﬁrms’ loans over the past three years (Nonlender-Afﬁliated
Funds Ownership) is not signiﬁcantly associated with voting dissent. The
effect is also economically signiﬁcant: a one-standard-deviation increase in

25 The sample consists of ﬁrms in major European stock indices (Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and
United Kingdom) as well Australia, Canada, and Japan.

Table IX

Voting Dissent and Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated Funds Ownership

This table presents estimates of ordinary least squares (OLS) and tobit (with censoring at 0 and 1)
ﬁrm-level panel regressions of voting dissent on executive compensation proposals. The dependent
variable is the percentage of votes against management’s proposals on executive compensation
plans at shareholder meetings (Voting Dissent). Lender-Afﬁliated Funds Ownership is ownership
by funds afﬁliated with commercial banks that were chosen by ﬁrm j as lead arrangers in a loan
over the past three years. Nonlender-Afﬁliated Funds Ownership is ownership by funds afﬁliated
with commercial banks that were not chosen by ﬁrm j as lead arrangers in a loan over the past
three years. Unafﬁliated Funds Ownership is ownership by funds unafﬁliated with commercial
banks. Institutional ownership is total institutional ownership and Insider Ownership is closely
held shares. Ownership variables are deﬁned as a percentage of market capitalization. All control
variables are lagged by one period. Variable deﬁnitions are provided in Table A.I in the Appendix.
The sample consists of non-U.S. ﬁrms for which votes at shareholder meetings are available
in Institutional Shareholder Services/RiskMetrics (ISS) over the 2008 to 2010 period. Robust t-
statistics adjusted for clustering at the country-industry level are reported in parentheses. *, **,
and *** indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

Lender-Afﬁliated Funds Ownership increases voting dissent by 0.54%, which
corresponds to about 10% of the average voting dissent. In addition, owner-
ship by unafﬁliated fund is associated with more voting dissent in executive
compensation proposals. The results in columns (2) to (4) show that the re-
sults hold when we include total institutional ownership as a control or use
tobit regressions.

C. Beneﬁts to the Fund Manager

The results so far show that overweighting client stocks in afﬁliated funds’
portfolios can be beneﬁcial from the perspective of the commercial banking
group as a whole. It is not clear, however, why fund managers would support
this strategy if doing so would hurt their track record. One possible expla-
nation is that managers are rewarded by being less likely to be replaced.
In this section, we test the hypothesis that favoring client stocks in portfo-
lio choices reduces a fund manager’s career concerns. To test for potential
beneﬁts to the fund manager, we test whether afﬁliated fund managers with
greater bias toward client stocks (High Bias Fund) are less likely to be replaced
than afﬁliated managers with less of a bias toward client stocks (Low Bias
Fund).

Our sources of data on manager names and tenures (i.e., fund manager
start dates) are the historical annual ﬁles from Lipper. From these histori-
cal ﬁles, we assemble a data set on fund manager turnover over the 2004
to 2010 period. We estimate a fund-level probit regression of fund manager
turnover-performance sensitivity in which the dependent variable is a dummy
variable that takes a value of 1 if there is a turnover in a given quarter
(given that the fund survived), and 0 otherwise. The main explanatory vari-
ables are the Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated dummy and the High Bias Fund
dummy. We also control for lagged performance rank and other fund and
manager characteristics (Khorana (1996), Chevalier and Ellison (1999), Kos-
tovetsky and Warner (2015)). In each quarter and country, fractional perfor-
mance ranks ranging from 0 (poorest performance) to 1 (best performance)
are assigned to funds according to their returns over the past four quarters
(Rank).

Table X reports the estimates of probit regressions of fund manager turnover.
We present the results separately for the samples of all funds, non-U.S. funds,
and U.S. funds. In column (1), which corresponds to the sample of all funds,
the coefﬁcient on the High Bias Fund dummy is negative but statistically in-
signiﬁcant. In column (2), which corresponds to the sample of non-U.S. funds,
the coefﬁcient on the High Bias Fund dummy is negative and statistically sig-
niﬁcant. The panel at the bottom of the table shows the economic signiﬁcance
of overweighting client stocks on the probability of fund manager turnover.
The predicted probability of a fund manager turnover in a given quarter for
a fund manager with more overweight on client stocks (other variables be-
ing evaluated at their means) is 0.93% lower than that for a fund manager
with lower bias on client stocks in the sample of non-U.S. funds (the uncon-
ditional probability of observing a turnover in a given quarter is about 2%).
Column (3) shows that the probability of a fund manager turnover is not
associated with the decision to favor client stocks in portfolio choice in the
sample of U.S. funds. Figure IA.1 in the Internet Appendix shows that fund
manager turnover-performance sensitivity is different between high and low
bias funds in the sample of all funds and non-U.S. funds, while it is similar
between high and low bias funds in the sample of U.S. funds. In addition,

Table X

Commercial Bank-Afﬁliated Fund Manager Turnover and Portfolio

Allocation to Client Stocks

This table presents estimates of fund-level probit regressions of fund manager turnover-
performance sensitivity. The dependent variable is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1
if the fund manager is replaced in a quarter, and 0 otherwise (Fund Manager Turnover). Com-
mercial Bank-Afﬁliated is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the ultimate owner of the
fund’s management company is a commercial banking group, and 0 otherwise. High Bias Fund is
a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if an afﬁliated fund’s Bias in Client Stocks is above the
median in a given country and quarter, and 0 otherwise. Bias in Client Stocks is the portfolio bias
in stocks of ﬁrms that borrow from the fund’s parent bank versus the average weight of comparable
passive funds. All control variables are lagged by one period. Variable deﬁnitions are provided in
Table A.I in the Appendix. The sample consists of actively managed domestic equity mutual funds
over the 2004 to 2010 period. Robust t-statistics adjusted for clustering at the ultimate owner level
are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
level, respectively.

Table IA.II in the Internet Appendix shows that conﬂicts of interest are
more pronounced during bear markets, when fund managers have heightened
career concerns.26

26 During bear markets, net inﬂows into mutual funds are generally weak (Karceski (2002)),
and fund family proﬁtability is lower. Both effects lead to lower compensation incentives for fund

In short, we ﬁnd that fund managers who act as team players for the banking
group by favoring client stocks beneﬁt from a lower probability of turnover.
This result does not hold for the sample of funds domiciled in the United
States where there are fewer conﬂicts of interest between the lending and
asset management divisions.

D. Investor Clienteles

We also examine the behavior of end investors of bank-afﬁliated funds. We
account for the possibility of different clienteles by studying the sensitivity of
fund ﬂows to past fund performance using the piecewise linear regression of
Sirri and Tufano (1998): Low = min(0.2, Rank), Mid = min(0.6, Rank− Low),
and High = Rank− (Low + Mid). We compare the sensitivity of ﬂows to past
fund performance of afﬁliated funds versus unafﬁliated fund investors.

Table XI reports the estimates of fund ﬂow-performance sensitivity regres-
sions for the sample of all funds as well as for the samples of non-U.S. and U.S.
funds. The estimates in columns (1) and (2), which correspond to the sample of
all funds, show that investors of afﬁliated funds and unafﬁliated funds exhibit
similar ﬂow-performance sensitivity. However, the estimates in columns (3)
and (4) show that afﬁliated funds have less ﬂow-performance sensitivity than
unafﬁliated funds in the sample of non-U.S. funds: a 10-percentile increase
in performance rank over the prior year increases unafﬁliated fund ﬂows by
4.0% ( = 0.1 × 9.984 × 4) per year for the bottom quintile, 1.3% per year for the
middle three quintiles, and 7.0% per year for the top quintile, while it increases
afﬁliated fund ﬂows by 1.3% for the bottom quintile, 1.1% for the middle three
quintiles, and 5.8% for the top quintile. The sensitivity of afﬁliated fund ﬂows
to poor performance is statistically insigniﬁcant, which suggests that afﬁliated
fund investors (typically, retail investors) exhibit inertia. In addition, the differ-
ence in ﬂow-performance sensitivities between afﬁliated funds and unafﬁliated
funds is statistically signiﬁcant for the bottom performance quintile (t-statistic
is 1.97).27 We conclude that afﬁliated fund ﬂows outside the United States tend
to be more “sticky and less discerning” (using the terminology in Sialm, Starks,
and Zhang (2015) and other papers on fund ﬂows).

managers in bear markets, as compensation is linked to fund size and fund family proﬁtability
(Farnsworth and Taylor (2006)). Moreover, the probability of job loss for fund managers is generally
higher in bear markets (Chevalier and Ellison (1999)), when there are more fund closures and
managers have fewer employment options (Kempf, Ruenzi, and Thiele (2009)).

27 We also estimate ﬂow-performance sensitivity regressions using a sample at the fund share
class level. The results reported in Table IA.XI in the Internet Appendix show that, for the sam-
ple of non-U.S. funds, the sensitivity of retail investors of bank-afﬁliated funds is statistically
insigniﬁcant and less than half (6.4 versus 17.4) of that of retail investors of unafﬁliated funds for
the bottom performance quintile. However, the results on ﬂows for institutional share classes are
estimated without precision, which we attribute to a low number of observations in the sample of
institutional share classes outside of the United States. In fact, in our sample of non-U.S. funds,
as of December 2010, institutional share classes amount to only 8% and 6% of the total number of
share classes and TNA, respectively. This fact suggests that, outside the United States, the mutual
fund market is oriented mostly toward the (less sophisticated) retail segment.

2221

The conﬂict of interest hypothesis assumes that afﬁliated fund investors
are unsophisticated. Alternatively, investors may be trading off performance
in exchange for some other beneﬁts with the bank (e.g., lower commissions,
lower spread on mortgages), which would be a result of an institutional ar-
rangement between investors and the banking group rather than a conﬂict of
interest within the bank. To address this possibility, Table IA.XII in the Internet
Appendix reports estimates of our baseline performance regressions for a sam-
ple of funds that cater exclusively to retail investors (i.e., funds without an
institutional share class) and for a sample of funds that cater to both retail and
institutional investors (i.e., funds with at least one institutional share class).
The results reported in Panel A show that bank-afﬁliated funds that cater ex-
clusively to retail investors signiﬁcantly underperform unafﬁliated funds. In
contrast, the results in Panel B show that funds that cater to both retail and
institutional investors do not signiﬁcantly underperform unafﬁliated funds.
These results are consistent with the notion that greater monitoring exerted
by institutional investors reduces agency problems (e.g., Evans and Fahlen-
brach (2012)). Taken together, our results suggest that the underperformance
of afﬁliated funds is driven by funds that cater exclusively to retail investors,
and thus provide further support for the conﬂict of interest hypothesis.28

Overall, our results show that outside the United States, investors of afﬁli-
ated funds exhibit inertia by failing to sell past losers and forgoing performance.
This result contrasts with those for U.S. funds, in which investors of afﬁliated
funds do not exhibit inertia. Consistent with our results, commercial bank-
afﬁliated funds have been losing market share in the United States, while
outside the United States, they still have a signiﬁcant market share.29

VI. Conclusion

We show that mutual fund performance is negatively affected when a man-
agement company is owned by a commercial banking group. We ﬁnd that com-
mercial bank-afﬁliated funds underperform unafﬁliated funds by about 92 ba-
sis points per year. Underperformance is more pronounced the larger the size of
the lending division relative to the asset management division and the higher
the funds’ direct exposure to the stock of the bank’s lending clients. We inter-
pret these results as indicating that bank-afﬁliated fund underperformance is
driven by a conﬂict of interest between the bank’s lending business and asset
management business.

28 We also estimate the ﬂow-performance sensitivity regressions in Table XI using the sample of
funds that cater exclusively to retail investors. Table IA.XIII in the Internet Appendix shows that
the sensitivity of afﬁliated fund ﬂows to poor performance is statistically insigniﬁcant outside the
United States.

29 The estimates in Figure IA.2 in the Internet Appendix show that bank-afﬁliated domestic
equity funds lost signiﬁcant market share both in the United States (from 18% in 2000 to 11% in
2010) and outside the United States (from 60% in 2000 to 40% in 2010). However, while afﬁliated
funds appear to be disappearing in the United States, outside the United States, they are able to
capture signiﬁcant market share of both incumbent and new funds.

We use divestitures of asset management divisions as a quasi-natural exper-
iment to address the concern that past performance may affect the organiza-
tional form of a fund management company. To address the concern that our
results might be driven by afﬁliated funds attracting less talented managers,
we compare the performance of bank-afﬁliated fund managers on the trading
of client stocks and nonclient stocks. While the client stocks that a fund buys
underperform the client stocks that a fund sells, this is not the case for non-
client stocks, which indicates that differences in manager skill are not likely to
explain our ﬁndings.

The evidence shows that afﬁliated funds systematically overweight stocks of
lending clients, which may help their parent banks build long-term relation-
ships with borrower ﬁrms that lead to future loan business. Our results also
suggest a beneﬁt to the borrower’s management, as we ﬁnd that ownership
by lender-afﬁliated funds reduces voting dissent on executive compensation
proposals at borrower shareholder meetings. We further ﬁnd that fund man-
agers that favor client stocks face a lower likelihood of turnover for the same
performance rank than managers with less of a bias toward client stocks.
Bank-afﬁliated funds still hold signiﬁcant market share despite their inferior
performance outside the United States, as afﬁliated fund ﬂows tend to be sticky
and not discerning.

Overall, our results suggest that the underperformance of commercial bank-
afﬁliated funds results from a double agency problem whereby fund managers
set aside the interests of one principal (the fund investor) to beneﬁt another
principal (the parent bank). Our ﬁndings have important implications, as about
40% of mutual funds worldwide operate not as stand-alone entities, but rather
as divisions of commercial banking groups.
