Deviations from Covered Interest Rate Parity

WENXIN DU, ALEXANDER TEPPER, and ADRIEN VERDELHAN∗

ABSTRACT

We ﬁnd that deviations from the covered interest rate parity (CIP) condition imply
large, persistent, and systematic arbitrage opportunities in one of the largest asset
markets in the world. Contrary to the common view, these deviations for major curren-
cies are not explained away by credit risk or transaction costs. They are particularly
strong for forward contracts that appear on banks’ balance sheets at the end of the
quarter, pointing to a causal effect of banking regulation on asset prices. The CIP
deviations also appear signiﬁcantly correlated with other ﬁxed income spreads and
with nominal interest rates.

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE (FX) FORWARD AND swap market is one of the largest
and most liquid derivative markets in the world, with a total notional amount
outstanding equal to $61 trillion and average daily turnover equal to $3 trillion
(Bank of International Settlements (2013, 2014)). The cornerstone of currency
forward and swap pricing, presented in all economics and ﬁnance textbooks
and taught in every class in international ﬁnance, is the covered interest rate
parity (CIP) condition. In this paper, we document deviations from the CIP in
the postcrisis period and investigate the causes of such deviations.

We ﬁrst show that the CIP condition has been systematically and per-
sistently violated among G10 currencies since the global ﬁnancial crisis in
2008, leading to signiﬁcant arbitrage opportunities in currency and ﬁxed in-
come markets. This ﬁnding is a puzzle for no-arbitrage models in macroeco-
nomics and ﬁnance. Since the arbitrage opportunities exist at a very short
horizon, such as overnight or at the one-week horizon, this ﬁnding is also a
puzzle for the classic limits-of-arbitrage models that rely on long-term mar-
ket risk, as in Shleifer and Vishny (1997). The systematic patterns of the
CIP violations point to a key interaction between costly ﬁnancial intermedia-
tion and international imbalances in funding supply and investment demand
across currencies in the new, postcrisis regulatory environment. In particu-
lar, we provide evidence of the impact of postcrisis regulatory reforms on CIP
arbitrage.

The intuition for the CIP condition relies on a simple no-arbitrage condition.
For example, an investor with U.S. dollars in hand today may deposit her dol-
lars for one month, earning the dollar deposit rate. Alternatively, the investor
may exchange her U.S. dollars for some foreign currency, deposit the foreign
currency, and earn the foreign currency deposit rate for one month. At the same
time, the investor can enter into a one-month currency forward contract today,
which would convert the foreign currency earned at the end of the month into
U.S. dollars. If both U.S. and foreign currency deposit rates are default-free and
the forward contract has no counterparty risk, the two investment strategies
are equivalent and thus should deliver the same payoffs. Therefore, the differ-
ence between U.S. dollar and foreign currency deposit rates should be exactly
equal to the cost of entering the forward contract, that is, the log difference
between the forward and the spot exchange rates, with all rates observed at
the same date.

The cross-currency basis measures the deviation from the CIP condition. It is
the difference between the direct dollar interest rate from the cash market and
the synthetic dollar interest rate obtained by swapping the foreign currency
into U.S. dollars. A positive (negative) currency basis means that the direct
dollar interest rate is higher (lower) than the synthetic dollar interest rate.
When the basis is zero, CIP holds. Before the global ﬁnancial crisis, the log
difference between the forward rate and the spot rate was approximately equal
to the difference in London interbank offered rates (Libor) across countries
(Frenkel and Levich (1975), Akram, Rime, and Sarno (2008)). In other words,
the Libor cross-currency basis was very close to zero. As is now well known,
large bases appeared during the height of the global ﬁnancial crisis and the
European debt crisis, as the interbank markets became impaired and arbitrage
capital was limited.

We show that Libor bases persist after the global ﬁnancial crisis among G10
currencies and remain large in magnitude. Our sample includes the most liquid
currencies, with a total daily turnover above $2 trillion (Bank of International
Settlements (2013)): the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Dan-
ish krone, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Norwegian krone, New Zealand
dollar, and Swedish krona. The average annualized absolute value of the basis

is 24 basis points (bps) at the three-month horizon and 27 bps at the ﬁve-year
horizon over the 2010 to 2016 sample.1 These averages hide large variations
both across currencies and over time. In the current economic environment,
the cross-currency basis can be of the same order of magnitude as the interest
rate differential. For example, the ﬁve-year basis for the Japanese yen was
close to −90 bps at the end of 2015, which was even greater in magnitude than
the difference (of about −70 bps) between the ﬁve-year Libor interest rate in
Japan and in the United States.

We show that credit risk in the Libor market and the indicative nature
of Libor cannot explain away the persistence of the cross-currency basis. A
common explanation for CIP deviations is that interbank panels have differ-
ent levels of creditworthiness (e.g., Tuckman and Porﬁrio (2004)). If, for ex-
ample, interbank lending in yen entails higher credit risk (due to the lower
credit quality of yen Libor banks) than interbank lending in U.S. dollars,
the lender should be compensated for the credit risk differential between
yen Libor and dollar Libor, and thus the cross-currency basis need not be
zero.2 Studying the credit default spreads of banks on interbank panels in
different currencies, we do not ﬁnd much support for this explanation of CIP
deviations.

More crucially, we document that the currency basis exists even in the ab-
sence of any credit risk difference across countries and for actual interest rate
quotes. To do so, we ﬁrst examine general collateral (GC) repurchase agree-
ments (repo) and then Kreditanstalt f ¨ur Wiederaufbau (KfW) bonds issued in
different currencies. Repo contracts are fully collateralized and thus do not
exhibit any credit risk. KfW bonds are fully backed by the German government
and thus exhibit very minimal credit risk, without differences in credit risk
across currencies. Repo and forward contracts highlight the CIP deviations at
the short end of the yield curves, while KfW bonds and swaps focus on longer
maturities. We ﬁnd that the repo currency basis is persistently and signiﬁ-
cantly negative for the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and the Danish krone,
and that the KfW basis is also signiﬁcantly different from zero for the euro, the
Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen, even after taking into account transaction
costs.

The CIP deviations thus lead to persistent arbitrage opportunities free from
exchange rate and credit risks. For example, a long-short arbitrageur may
borrow at the U.S. dollar repo rate or short U.S. dollar-denominated KfW
bonds and then earn risk-free positive proﬁts by investing in repo rates or KfW
bonds denominated in low interest rate currencies such as the euro, the Swiss
franc, the Danish krone, or the yen while hedging the foreign currency risk
using FX forwards or swaps. The net arbitrage proﬁts range from 10 to 20 bps

1 One-hundred basis points equal 1%.
2 “Libor” rates measure the interest rates at which Libor panel banks borrow from each other.
In this paper, we use the term “Libor” loosely to refer to the benchmark unsecured interbank
borrowing rate, which can be determined by local interbank panels rather than the British Banker
Association (now Intercontinental Exchange) Libor panels.

on average in annualized values. The conditional volatility of each investment
opportunity is naturally zero and Sharpe ratios are thus inﬁnite for the ﬁxed
investment horizon of the strategy.

After documenting the persistence of CIP deviations and formally establish-
ing arbitrage opportunities, we turn to their potential explanations. We hy-
pothesize that persistent CIP deviations can be explained by the combination
of constraints on ﬁnancial intermediaries following the crisis and persistent
international imbalances in investment demand and funding supply across
currencies. If ﬁnancial intermediaries were unconstrained, the supply of cur-
rency hedging should be perfectly elastic and any CIP deviations should be
arbitraged away. Similarly, if the global funding and investment demand were
balanced across currencies, there would be no client demand for FX swaps to
transform funding liquidity or investment opportunities across currencies, and
thus the cross-currency basis would be zero regardless of the supply of currency
hedging. Costly ﬁnancial intermediation can explain why the basis is not ar-
bitraged away following the crisis. The imbalances in savings and investment
across currencies can explain the systematic relationship between the basis
and nominal interest rates.

Consistent with our two-factor hypothesis, we ﬁnd that the CIP deviations
exhibit four main characteristics. First, CIP deviations increase toward the
quarter-ends, as banks face tighter balance sheet constraints and renewed in-
vestor attention due to quarterly regulatory ﬁlings. We ﬁnd that the one-month
CIP deviation increases exactly one month before the quarter-ends, when a
one-month forward contract has to appear on the quarter-end balance sheet.
Likewise, the one-week CIP deviation increases exactly one week before the
quarter-ends. This is the smoking gun. Meanwhile, a three-month CIP trade,
which has to appear on a quarter-end report regardless of when it is executed,
does not exhibit any particular dynamics. In this example, the one-month or
one-week forward contracts that cross the quarter-ends are the “treated” as-
sets, subject to higher balance sheet costs due to regulatory ﬁlings, while the
three-month forward contract is the “nontreated” asset. Our simple difference-
in-difference experiments exploit different lags before the quarter-ends and
different horizons of the forward contracts. The term structure of short-term
CIP deviations suggests that banking regulation has a causal impact on asset
prices.

Second, a proxy for the shadow costs of banks’ balance sheet accounts for
about one-third of the CIP deviations. Our proxy is the spread between the
interest rates on excess reserves (IOER) paid by the Fed and the federal funds
rate or U.S. Libor rate. In the absence of balance sheet costs, banks should
borrow at the federal funds rate/U.S. Libor rate and invest risk-free at the
IOER, until the federal funds rate/Libor rate increases and both rates are equal.
Yet, a signiﬁcant spread persists, which we interpret as a proxy for the shadow
cost of leverage. Moreover, if banks invest at the foreign IOER, because foreign
central bank reserves are more liquid than private money market instruments
(as codiﬁed by the liquidity coverage ratio requirement under Basel III), the
CIP deviations are further reduced by one-third on average.

Third, in both the cross section and the time series, the cross-currency basis
is positively correlated with the level of nominal interest rates. In the cross
section, high-interest-rate currencies tend to exhibit positive basis, while low-
interest-rate currencies tend to exhibit negative basis. An arbitrageur should
thus borrow in high-interest-rate currencies and lend in low-interest-rate cur-
rencies while hedging the currency risk—this allocation is the opposite of that
associated with the classic currency carry trade. In the time series, the cross-
currency basis tends to increase with interest rate shocks, as measured in an
event study of yield changes around monetary policy announcements of the
European Central Bank (ECB).

Fourth, the cross-currency basis is correlated with other liquidity spreads,
especially the KfW over German bund basis and the U.S. Libor tenor basis,
which is the price of swapping the one-month U.S. Libor rate in exchange
for the three-month U.S. Libor rate. The comovement in bases measured in
different markets points to the role of ﬁnancial intermediaries and correlated
demand shocks for dollar funding and other forms of liquidity.

We now provide a short review of existing relevant work. A large literature
shows that the CIP condition holds well in periods before the global ﬁnancial
crisis.3 A number of papers document the failure of the CIP condition dur-
ing the global ﬁnancial crisis and the European debt crisis (see, for example,
Baba, Packer, and Nagano (2008), Baba, McCauley, and Ramaswamy (2009),
Coffey, Hrung, and Sarkar (2009), Griffolli and Ranaldo (2011), Bottazzi et al.
(2012), and Ivashina, Scharfstein, and Stein (2015)). All of these papers focus
on CIP deviations based on short-term money market instruments. The large
cross-currency basis during the crisis appears to be linked to a severe dollar
funding shortage in the presence of limits to arbitrage. The establishment of
Fed swap lines with various foreign central banks, which alleviated the dol-
lar shortage, signiﬁcantly reduced the magnitude of the cross-currency basis
(Baba and Packer (2009), Goldberg, Kennedy, and Miu (2011), McGuire and
von Peter (2012)).

Our work focuses on the postcrisis period and is closely related to a large
literature that departs from the frictionless asset pricing benchmark.4 On the
theory side, Garleanu and Pedersen (2011) build a margin-based asset pricing
model and use it to study the deviations from CIP during the crisis. Gabaix
and Maggiori (2015) provide a tractable and elegant model of exchange rate

3 Early discussions of the CIP condition appear in Lotz (1889) and much more clearly in Keynes
(1923). A large literature in the 1970s and 1980s tests the CIP condition, notably Frenkel and
Levich (1975, 1977), Deardorff (1979), Dooley and Isard (1980), Callier (1981), Bahmani-Oskooee
and Das (1985), and Clinton (1988).

4 Building on our work, CIP deviations following the crisis have become an area of active re-
search. In ongoing work, Avdjiev et al. (2016) study the relationship between the strength of the
dollar spot exchange rate and CIP deviations. Amador et al. (2017) model exchange rate policy
at the zero lower bound and relate it to CIP deviations. Liao (2016) examines the implications of
corporate funding cost arbitrage for CIP deviations. Rime, Schrimpf, and Syrstad (2016) focus on
the role of money market segmentation for CIP deviations. Sushko et al. (2016) link the estimated
dollar hedging demand (quantities) for major currencies to variation in CIP deviations (prices).

determination in the presence of moral hazard. A variant of their model, pre-
sented in their appendix, encompasses CIP deviations. Our evidence on the
impact of banking regulation points toward models of intermediary-based as-
set pricing, such as those of He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013) and Brun-
nermeier and Sannikov (2014) in the tradition of Bernanke and Gertler (1989)
and Holmstrom and Tirole (1997). But many other friction-based models could
potentially be relevant.5 To the best of our knowledge, however, no model in-
troduced so far can replicate our four main facts on CIP deviations. On the
empirical side, Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014) and He, Kelly, and Manela
(2017) show that shocks to the equity capital ratio of ﬁnancial intermediaries
account for a large share of the cross-sectional variation in expected returns
in different asset classes. Siriwardane (2016) shows that limited investment
capital impacts pricing in the credit default swap (CDS) market. Our work is
also closely related to recent papers on the interaction between the new U.S.
monetary policy implementation framework and banking regulations, as dis-
cussed in Dufﬁe and Krishnamurthy (2016), Klee, Senyuz, and Yoldas (2016),
and Banegas and Tase (2016), and window dressing activities in repo markets
on ﬁnancial reporting dates (Munyan (2015)).

The paper is organized as follows. Section I deﬁnes and documents the CIP
condition and its deviations at the short and long ends of the yield curves.
Section II shows that the cross-currency basis exists in the absence of credit
risk, for repo rates and KfW bonds, leading to clear arbitrage opportunities.
Section III sketches a potential explanation for the CIP deviations that relies
on the capital constraints of ﬁnancial intermediaries and global imbalances.
Consistent with such an explanation, Section IV identiﬁes four characteristics
of the currency basis: its surge at the end of quarters following the crisis, its
high correlation with other liquidity-based strategies in different ﬁxed income
markets, its relationship with the IOER, and its cross-sectional and time-series
links with interest rates. Section V concludes.

I. CIP Condition and Cross-Currency Basis

In this section, we review the CIP condition and deﬁne the cross-currency
basis as the deviation from the CIP condition. We then document the persistent
failure of the textbook CIP condition based on Libor.

5 The large theoretical literature on limits to arbitrage, surveyed in Gromb and Vayanos (2010),
provides useful frameworks, with the caveat that CIP arbitrages exist over very short time horizons
over which market risk and collateral constraints are limited. Focusing on the U.S. swap market,
Jermann (2016) proposes a novel and attractive limits-to-arbitrage model based on the regulation-
induced increased cost of holding Treasuries. Likewise, models of market and funding liquidity,
as in Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), or models of preferred habitat, as in Vayanos and Vila
(2009) or Greenwood and Vayanos (2014), are potential theoretical frameworks to account for the
CIP deviations. Our ﬁndings are also related to models of the global imbalances in safe assets, as
studied in the pioneering work of Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2008, 2016).

A. Covered Interest Rate Parity

Let y$

t,t+n and yt,t+n denote the continuously compounded n-year risk-free
interest rates quoted at date t in U.S. dollars and foreign currency, respectively.
The spot exchange rate St is expressed in units of foreign currency per U.S.
dollar; an increase in St thus denotes a depreciation of the foreign currency and
an appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Likewise, Ft,t+n denotes the n-year outright
forward exchange rate in foreign currency per U.S. dollar at time t. The CIP
condition states that the forward rate should satisfy

eny$

t,t+n = enyt,t+n St
Ft,t+n

.

(1)

In logs, the continuously compounded forward premium, ρt,t+n, is equal to the
interest rate difference

ρt,t+n ≡ 1
n

( ft,t+n − st) = yt,t+n − y$

t,t+n.

(2)

The intuition behind the CIP condition is simple: an investor with one U.S.
dollar in hand today would own eny$
t,t+n U.S. dollars n years from now by investing
in U.S. dollars. But the investor may instead exchange her U.S. dollar for St
units of foreign currency and invest in foreign currency to receive enyt,t+nSt units
of foreign currency n years from now. A currency forward contract signed today
would convert the foreign currency earned into enyt,t+nSt/Ft,t+n U.S. dollars. If
both domestic and foreign notes are risk-free aside from the currency risk and
the forward contract has no counterparty risk, the two investment strategies
are equivalent and therefore should deliver the same payoffs. All contracts are
signed today. The CIP condition is thus a simple no-arbitrage condition.6

B. Deﬁnition of the Cross-Currency Basis

We deﬁne the continuously compounded cross-currency basis, denoted by

xt,t+n, as the deviation from the CIP condition:
t,t+n = enyt,t+n+nxt,t+n St
Ft,t+n

eny$

.

Equivalently, in logs, the cross-currency basis is equal to

xt,t+n = y$

t,t+n − (yt,t+n − ρt,t+n).

(3)

(4)

6 In the presence of transaction costs, the absence of arbitrage is characterized by two inequal-
ities: arbitrage must be impossible by borrowing the domestic currency and lending the foreign
currency, or by doing the opposite, and hedging the currency risk with the forward contract in
both cases (see Bekaert and Hodrick (2012) for a textbook exposition). As a result, the bid and ask
forward rates satisfy

Figure 1. Cash ﬂow diagram for CIP arbitrage with a negative basis. This ﬁgure plots the
cash ﬂow exchanges of an arbitrageur proﬁting from a negative cross-currency basis (xt,t+1 < 0)
between the yen and the U.S. dollar. To arbitrage the negative cross-currency basis, the U.S.
dollar arbitrageur borrows one U.S. dollar at the interest rate y$
t,t+1, converts it into St yen, lends
in yen at the interest rate yt,t+1, and signs a forward contract at date t. There is no cash ﬂow
at date t. At date t + 1, the arbitrageur receives eyt,t+1 St (cid:7) (1 + yt,t+1)St yen, and converts that
into eyt,t+1 St/Ft,t+1 (cid:7) (1 + yt,t+1)St/Ft,t+1 U.S. dollars due to the forward contract. The arbitrageur
repays her debt in U.S. dollars and is left with a proﬁt equal to the negative of the cross-currency
basis xt,t+1. In essence, the arbitrageur is going long in the yen and short in the dollar, with the yen
cash ﬂow fully hedged by a forward contract. (Color ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)

When CIP holds, comparison of equations (1) and (3) immediately implies that
the currency basis is zero. The cross-currency basis measures the difference
between the direct U.S. dollar interest rate, y$
t,t+n, and the synthetic dollar in-
terest rate, yt,t+n − ρt,t+n, obtained by converting the foreign currency interest
rate into U.S. dollars using currency forward contracts. A negative currency ba-
sis suggests that the direct U.S. dollar interest rate is lower than the synthetic
dollar interest rate.

As already noted, CIP holds in the absence of arbitrage. As soon as the basis is
not zero, arbitrage opportunities theoretically appear. Figure 1 provides a cash
ﬂow diagram of this CIP arbitrage strategy. In the case of a negative basis, x <
0, the dollar arbitrageur can earn risk-free proﬁts equal to an annualized |x|%
of the trade notional by borrowing at the direct dollar risk-free rate, investing
at the foreign currency risk-free rate, and signing a forward contract to convert
the foreign currency back into U.S. dollars. In the case of a positive basis, the
opposite arbitrage strategy of funding in the synthetic dollar risk-free rate and
investing in the direct dollar risk-free rate would also yield an annualized risk-
free proﬁt equal to x% of the trade notional. With these deﬁnitions in mind, we
turn now to a preliminary look at the data.

C. Failure of Textbook Libor-Based Covered Interest Parity

Textbook tests of the CIP condition usually rely on Libor rates.7 We document
persistent failure of Libor-based CIP after 2007 for G10 currencies at short and
long maturities. As we discuss above, at short maturities less than one year, CIP
violations can be computed using Libor rates and currency forward and spot
rates. At the longer maturities (typically one year or greater), CIP violations
based on Libor are quoted directly as spreads on Libor cross-currency basis
swaps.

C.1. Short-Term Libor Cross-Currency Basis

We deﬁne the Libor basis as equal to
(cid:2)
t,t+n ≡ y$,Libor
t,t+n −
xLibor

t,t+n − ρt,t+n
yLibor

(cid:3)

where the generic dollar and foreign currency interest rates of equation (4)
are replaced with Libor rates. We obtain daily spot exchange rates and forward
points from Bloomberg using London closing rates for G10 currencies. Mid rates
(average of bid and ask rates) are used for benchmark basis calculations. Daily
Libor/interbank ﬁxing rates are also obtained from Bloomberg and described
in the Data Appendix. Figure 2 shows the three-month Libor basis for G10
currencies between January 2000 and September 2016.

The three-month Libor basis was very close to zero for all G10 currencies be-
fore 2007. During the global ﬁnancial crisis (2007 to 2009), there were large de-
viations from Libor CIP, especially around the Lehman bankruptcy announce-
ment, with some bases reaching −200 bps. But the deviations from Libor CIP
did not disappear when the crisis abated: since the crisis, the three-month Libor
basis has been persistently different from zero. Panel A of Table I summarizes
the mean and standard deviation of the three-month Libor cross-currency basis
across three periods: 2000 to 2006, 2007 to 2009, and 2010 to 2016. Precrisis,
the Libor basis was not signiﬁcantly different from zero; postcrisis, it is. More-
over, a clear cross-sectional dispersion in the level of the basis appears among
G10 currencies. The Australian dollar (AUD) and New Zealand dollar (NZD)
exhibit, on average, a positive basis of 5 and 12 bps at the three-month horizon,
while the Swiss franc (CHF), Danish krone (DKK), euro (EUR), Japanese yen
(JPY), Norwegian krone (NOK), and Swedish krona (SEK) exhibit, on average,
negative bases below −20 bps. Among the G10 currencies, the Danish krone
has the most negative three-month Libor basis postcrisis, with an average of
−60 bps, a stark contrast to its precrisis average of −2 bps.8

7 Eurocurrency deposit rates based in London have long been used as benchmark interest rates
to test the CIP condition, starting with Frenkel and Levich (1975), as eurocurrency deposits are
highly fungible and avoid many barriers to the free ﬂow of capital, such as differential domestic
interest rate regulations, tax treatments, and reserve regulations. Akram, Rime, and Sarno (2008)
conﬁrm the validity of the CIP condition using bank deposit rates in the early 2000s sample.

8 The Danish central bank maintains a peg of its currency to the euro. Yet, the CIP deviations
are larger for the Danish krone than for the euro, in part, reﬂecting the risk of a sudden break of
the peg, similar to the Swiss franc experience in January 2015.

Figure 2. Short-term Libor-based deviations from covered interest rate parity. This ﬁg-
ure plots the 10-day moving averages of the three-month Libor cross-currency basis, measured in
bps for G10 currencies. Covered interest rate parity implies that the basis should be zero. The
Libor basis is equal to y$,Libor
t,t+n denote
the U.S. and foreign three-month Libor rates, and ρt,t+n ≡ 1
n( ft,t+n − st) denotes the forward pre-
mium obtained from the forward ft,t+n and spot st exchange rates. (Color ﬁgure can be viewed at

C.2. Long-Term Libor Cross-Currency Basis

At long maturities, the long-term CIP deviation based on Libor is given
by the spread on the cross-currency basis swap. A cross-currency basis swap
involves an exchange of cash ﬂows linked to ﬂoating interest rates referenced
to interbank rates in two currencies, as well as an exchange of principal in two
currencies at the inception and the maturity of the swap. Let us take a simple
example. Figure 3 provides a cash ﬂow diagram for the yen/U.S. dollar cross-
currency swap on $1 notional between Bank A and Bank B. At the inception
of the swap, Bank A receives $1 from Bank B in exchange for ¥St. At the jth
coupon date, Bank A pays a dollar ﬂoating cash ﬂow equal to yLibor,$
on the $1
notional to Bank B, where yLibor,$
is the three-month U.S. dollar Libor at time
t + j. In return, Bank A receives from Bank B a ﬂoating yen cash ﬂow equal
to (yt+j
Libor,¥ is the three-month
yen Libor at time t + j and xxccy
t,t+n is the cross-currency basis swap spread, which
is predetermined at date t at the inception of the swap transaction. When the
swap contract matures, Bank B receives $1 from Bank A in exchange for ¥St,
undoing the initial transaction.

swap counterparties are willing to exchange foreign currency ﬂoating cash

Figure 3. Cash ﬂow diagram for JPY/USD cross-currency basis swap. This ﬁgure shows
the cash ﬂow exchanges of a standard yen/U.S. dollar cross-currency basis swap. At the inception
of the swap, Bank A receives $1 from Bank B in exchange for ¥St. At the jth coupon date, Bank A
pays a dollar ﬂoating cash ﬂow equal to yLibor,$
is the
three-month U.S. dollar Libor at time t + j. In return, Bank A receives from Bank B a ﬂoating yen
cash ﬂow equal to (yt+j
Libor,¥ is the three-month
yen Libor at time t + j and xxccy
t,t+n is the cross-currency basis swap spread, which is predetermined at
date t at the inception of the swap transaction. When the swap contract matures, Bank B receives
$1 from Bank A in exchange for ¥St, undoing the initial transaction. (Color ﬁgure can be viewed

ﬂows against U.S. dollar cash ﬂows. In the case of the yen/U.S dollar cross-
currency swap over the recent period, xxccy
t,t+n is often negative. Let us assume for
simplicity that Bank B is able to lend risk-free in yen at the three-month yen
Libor rate, yt+j
Libor,¥. Then, according to the cross-currency basis swap contract,
Bank B has to pay to Bank A the yen cash ﬂows (yt+j
xccy), which is
clearly less than the yen Libor rate yt+j
Libor,¥ that Bank B collects by investing
the yen it originally received from Bank A. In this example, Bank B pockets a
sure proﬁt by lending U.S. dollars to Bank A. In other words, if both banks can
borrow and lend risk-free at Libor rates, then the cross-currency basis should
be zero. As soon as the cross-currency basis swap is not zero, one counterparty
beneﬁts from the swap, hinting at potential deviations from the CIP condition

More formally, to see how the cross-currency basis swap translates directly
into deviations from the long-term Libor-based CIP condition, let us focus on
the case of zero-coupon ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed cross-currency swap contracts. Such con-
tracts are similar to the swap contract described above and in Figure 3, but no
coupon payments are exchanged at the intermediary dates. Intuitively, an in-
vestor can take three steps to swap ﬁxed foreign currency cash ﬂows into ﬁxed
U.S. dollar cash ﬂows. First, she pays the foreign currency interest rate swap,
yIRS
t,t+n, to swap ﬁxed foreign currency cash ﬂows into ﬂoating foreign currency
Libor cash ﬂows. Second, she pays the cross-currency basis swap, xxccy
t,t+n, to swap
ﬂoating foreign currency Libor into U.S. dollar Libor cash ﬂows. Third, she re-
ceives the U.S. interest rate swap, y$,IRS
t,t+n , to swap ﬂoating dollar U.S. Libor
cash ﬂows into ﬁxed U.S. dollar cash ﬂows. The three steps together eliminate

September 2016, while Panel B of Table I reports averages and standard devi-
ations by subperiod. Before 2007, the ﬁve-year Libor basis was slightly positive
for Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand dollars and negative for all other
currencies, but all bases were very close to zero. The ﬁve-year Libor bases
started diverging from zero in 2008, reaching their sample peak during the Eu-
ropean debt crisis in 2012. The Libor bases narrowed in 2013 and early 2014,
but started widening again in the second half of 2014. In the postcrisis sample,
the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar exhibit the most positive
bases, equal to 25 and 31 bps, on average, respectively, while the Japanese yen
and the Danish krone exhibit the most negative bases, equal to −62 and −47
bps on average, respectively. The Swiss franc and the euro also experience very
negative bases.

At short and long horizons, CIP deviations abound postcrisis. But the text-
book treatment of these deviations points to potential transaction costs and
default risk, not necessarily to arbitrage opportunities.

II. CIP-Based Arbitrage Opportunities

In this section, we start with a short description of the main concerns with
a Libor-based investment strategy and then address those concerns using repo
contracts and bonds issued by KfW and other multicurrency issuers. We demon-
strate that the existence of the repo and KfW basis implies CIP arbitrage op-
portunities free from currency and credit risk, even after taking into account
transaction costs.

A. Credit Risk in the Libor CIP Arbitrage

A potential arbitrageur, noticing say a negative Libor CIP basis on the
yen/dollar market, would need to borrow in U.S. dollars at the dollar Libor
rate, invest in yen at the yen Libor rate, and enter a forward contract to convert
yen back into U.S dollars at the end of her investment period. The investment
strategy immediately raises three questions. First, can the arbitrageur really
borrow and lend at the Libor rates? Libor rates are only indicative, that is, they
do not correspond to actual transactions. The arbitrageur’s actual borrowing
rate in U.S. dollars may thus be higher than the indicative Libor rate, even
in the absence of any manipulation. More generally, transaction costs exist for
both spot and derivative contracts and may lower the actual returns. Second,
does the arbitrageur take on credit risk when lending at the yen Libor rate?
Libor rates are unsecured: if the arbitrageur faces a risk of default on her loan,
she should be compensated by a default risk premium, which may then account
for the CIP deviations. Third, does the arbitrageur take on counterparty risk
when entering an exchange rate forward contract? This last concern appears
of second-order importance, as the effect of counterparty risk on the pricing of
forwards and swaps is negligible due to the high degree of collateralization. As
speciﬁed in the Credit Support Annex of the International Swap and Deriva-
tive Association, common market practice is to post variation margins in cash

 15406261, 2018, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12620 by KIZ der Universitat Ulm, Wiley Online Library on [20/11/2024].

with the amount equal to the mark-to-market value of the swap. Initial mar-
gins are also posted to cover the gap risk not covered by the variation margins.
In the event of a counterparty default, the collateral is seized by the other
counterparty to cover the default cost.10

The indicative nature of Libor and the potential default risk are valid con-
cerns. Indeed, default risk appears as the recent leading explanation for CIP
deviations in the literature (e.g., Tuckman and Porﬁrio (2004)). Formally, the
default risk explanation of CIP deviations relies on cross-country differences in
creditworthiness of different Libor panel banks. Let us assume that the mean
credit spread for the yen Libor panel is given by spJPY
and the mean credit
and y∗USD
. Let y∗JPY
spread for the U.S. dollar Libor panel is given by spUSD
be the true risk-free rates in yen and U.S. dollars and assume that CIP holds
for risk-free rates. Starting from the deﬁnition of the basis in equation (4) and
replacing each interest rate by the sum of the risk-free rate and the credit
spread leads to

In the absence of CIP deviations for risk-free rates, the term inside brackets is
zero. In this case, the Libor-based currency basis of the yen/dollar is given by
the difference between credit risk in dollar Libor and yen Libor panels:

(8)

Therefore, the yen basis can be negative if the yen Libor panel is riskier than
the dollar Libor panel. We test this hypothesis by regressing changes in the
Libor basis xi,Libor
for currency i on changes in the mean CDS spread between
banks on the interbank panel of currency i and the dollar panel:

We use weekly changes in ﬁve-year Libor cross-currency basis swaps and ﬁve-
year credit default swaps (CDS) of banks since 2007. The banks on the inter-
bank panels included in our study and detailed regression results are reported
in the Internet Appendix. If CDS spreads measure credit spreads perfectly,
equation (8) suggests a slope coefﬁcient of −1 and an R2 of 1. All of the slope
coefﬁcients are statistically different from −1, most of them are positive, and
all R2 are tiny. In a nutshell, we do not ﬁnd much evidence in favor of credit
risk. To rule it out, we turn to repo contracts.

10 Direct empirical estimates for the magnitude of counterparty risk are available for the CDS
market, where counterparty risk is a more serious concern due to the possibility of losing the
full notional of the trade. Consistent with a high degree of collateralization, Arora, Gandhi, and
Longstaff (2011) ﬁnd that a 645 bps increase in the seller’s CDS spread translates into only a 1 bps
reduction in the quoted CDS premium using actionable quote data. Using real CDS transaction
data, Du et al. (2016) obtain estimates of similar magnitude.

B. Repo Basis

The Journal of Finance R(cid:3)

At short maturities, one way to eliminate the credit risk associated with
Libor-based CIP is to use secured borrowing and lending rates from the repo
markets. We thus use GC repo rates in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies to
construct an alternative currency basis measure.

A general collateral (GC) repo is a repurchase agreement in which the cash
lender is willing to accept a variety of Treasury and agency securities as col-
lateral. Since GC assets are of high quality and very liquid, GC repo rates are
driven by the supply and demand of cash, as opposed to the supply and demand
of individual collateral assets. Given the U.S. dollar GC repo rate y$,Repo
t,t+n and
the foreign currency GC repo rate yRepo
t,t+n, the general deﬁnition of the basis in
equation (4) leads to the following repo basis:
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

t,t+n = y$,Repo
t,t+n −
xRepo

t,t+n − ρt,t+n

.

(10)

Since the bulk of repo transactions entail very short maturities, we focus on
the repo basis at the one-week horizon.

Our data cover the Swiss, Danish, euro-area, Japanese, and U.S. repo mar-
kets. The ﬁrst two columns of Table II report the annualized mean and standard
deviation of Libor- and repo-based bases during the January 2009 to Septem-
ber 2016 period. The two bases are indistinguishable from each other for most
of the sample period. The Danish krone exhibits the most negative mean repo
basis, equal to −41 bps if Libor-based and −35 bps if repo-based. The euro ex-
hibits the least negative mean repo basis of −20 bps with Libor rates and −15
with repo rates. For the Swiss franc and the yen, the CIP deviation is larger in
magnitude for repo than for Libor rates. Clearly, CIP deviations exist even for
interest rates that are free from credit risk.

A negative basis entices the arbitrageur to borrow at the U.S. dollar GC repo
rate and invest in the foreign currency GC repo rate, while paying the forward
premium to hedge the foreign currency exposure. A positive basis suggests
the opposite strategy of borrowing at the foreign currency rate, receiving the
forward premium, and investing in the U.S. dollar rate. The arbitrage proﬁts
under the negative and positive arbitrage strategies, denoted by π Repo−and
π Repo+, respectively, are thus

We assume that the transaction cost for each step of the arbitrage strategy is
equal to one-half of the posted bid-ask spread. We take into account bid-ask
spreads on all forward and spot contracts and a conservative bid-ask spread
for the U.S. dollar repo. The average bid-ask spread for U.S. repo used in our
calculation is about 9 bps, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the 4 bps bid-ask
spread quoted on Tullett Prebon. Transaction costs for Danish repos are also

One-Week Libor- and Repo-Based Basis and Repo CIP Arbitrage

Columns (1) and (2) report the annualized mean and standard deviation for the one-week Libor
and GC repo basis for the Swiss franc (CHF), the euro (EUR), the Danish krone (DKK), and the
Japanese yen (JPY) during the 01/01/2009 to 09/15/2016 period. Column (3) reports the mean and
standard deviation for the one-week arbitrage proﬁts of funding at the U.S. dollar GC repo rate
and investing at the foreign currency GC repo rate, provided that the arbitrage proﬁts are positive.
The last column reports the mean and standard deviation for the one-week arbitrage proﬁts of
funding at the U.S. dollar Libor and investing at the foreign currency GC repo rate, provided that
the arbitrage proﬁts are positive. In the last two columns, we also report the percentage of the
sample with positive arbitrage proﬁts for each currency. All arbitrage proﬁts take into account
the transaction costs on the forward and spot exchange rates, and the U.S. and Danish krone
repo rates, but not the Swiss franc, euro, and yen repo rates. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses.

taken into account with signiﬁcantly wider average bid-ask spreads equal to
19 bps. The Bloomberg series used in our repo basis calculations do not contain
bid-ask spreads for the euro, Swiss franc, or yen. In the case of euro repos, data
from Thomson Reuters Eikon suggest that the average bid-ask spread is about 6
bps. We do not have bid-ask spread information for the Swiss franc and the yen.
The third column of Table II reports the net proﬁts obtained from the nega-
tive basis arbitrage strategy, which is implemented provided that the ex-ante
proﬁts are positive. The average annualized proﬁts range from 11 to 19 bps after
taking into account transaction costs. The proﬁts vary over time, with standard
deviations ranging from 13 to 27 bps. The arbitrage proﬁts are positive for the
majority of the sample window. The conditional volatility of each arbitrage
strategy is again naturally zero, and the conditional Sharpe ratio is inﬁnite.

One potential concern with the arbitrage above is that borrowing in the U.S.
GC repo market would require posting a U.S. Treasury bond as collateral,
while investing in the foreign GC repo market would entail receiving a foreign
Treasury bond as collateral. As a result, the scarcity of U.S. Treasury bonds
as collateral or the difference in collateral value between U.S. and foreign

 15406261, 2018, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12620 by KIZ der Universitat Ulm, Wiley Online Library on [20/11/2024].

The Journal of Finance R(cid:3)

Treasury bonds could in theory be a source of CIP deviations for repo rates. To
address this concern, in the last column of Table II, we report the arbitrage
proﬁts for borrowing in the U.S. Libor market and investing in the respective
foreign GC repo market. Since this arbitrage uses unsecured dollar funding,
the arbitrageur does not need to post U.S. Treasury bonds as collateral, but
nevertheless receives the foreign Treasury bonds as collateral. The arbitrage
proﬁts in column (4) are very similar to the proﬁts in column (3) based on U.S.
repo funding. This suggests that collateral valuation cannot be a main driver
of CIP deviations.

C. KfW Basis

We turn now to CIP deviations at the long end of the yield curve. GC repo
contracts do not exist for long maturities, but we can construct an alternative
long-term cross-currency basis free from credit risk by comparing direct dollar
yields on dollar-denominated debt and synthetic dollar yields on debt denomi-
nated in other currencies for the same risk-free issuer and the same maturity
in years. To do so, we focus on bonds issued by the KfW, a AAA-rated German
government-owned development bank, with all its liabilities fully backed by
the German government. The KfW is a very large multicurrency issuer, with
an annual issuance of around $70 billion and $370 billion of bonds outstanding.
Schwartz (2015) provides more details on KfW bonds, comparing them to Ger-
man government bonds to study their liquidity premium. Here, we compare
KfW bonds of similar maturity issued in different currencies.

To simplify exposition, we consider a world with zero-coupon yield curves
and swap rates. Detailed calculations involving coupon-bearing bonds and ad-
ditional data are reported in the Internet Appendix.

The ﬁrst column of Table III reports summary statistics on the KfW basis
during the January 2009 to August 2016 period. The mean postcrisis KfW basis
is zero for the Australian dollar but is signiﬁcantly negative for the other three
currencies: −24 bps for the Swiss franc, −14 bps for the euro, and −30 bps
for the yen. The second column of Table III reports similar summary statistics
for the basis conditional on a positive basis for the Australian dollar and a
negative basis for the other three currencies: while the Australian dollar basis
is positive only 56% of the time, the other bases are negative at least 94% of
the time. As a result, the average conditional basis is 7 bps for the Australian
dollar, and close to its unconditional value for the other currencies: −24 bps for
the Swiss franc, −15 bps for the euro, and −31 bps for the yen. These bases
point to potential arbitrage strategies.

When the KfW basis is negative, a potential arbitrage strategy would be to
invest in the KfW bond denominated in foreign currency, pay the cross-currency
swap to convert foreign currency cash ﬂows into U.S. dollars, and short-sell the
KfW bond denominated in U.S. dollars, paying the shorting fee. When the KfW
basis is positive, the arbitrage strategy would be the opposite.11

11 Since shorting contracts expire before KfW bonds mature, the strategy embeds a small

rollover-fee risk.

and foreign currency j. The ﬁrst column reports the annualized mean and annualized standard
deviation for the KfW basis by currency during the 1/1/2009 to 08/31/2016 period. The second
column reports similar statistics, conditional on observing a positive KfW basis for the Australian
dollar (AUD) and a negative KfW basis for the Swiss franc (CHF), euro (EUR), and Japanese yen
(JPY). The third column reports summary statistics for arbitrage proﬁts. The arbitrages (a positive
basis arbitrage strategy for the Australian dollar and a negative basis arbitrage strategy for the
Swiss franc, euro, and Japanese yen) are implemented, provided that the proﬁts remain positive
after taking into account the bid-ask spreads of bonds and swaps. The last two columns report
similar proﬁts also taking into account the cost of shorting KfW bonds. The fourth (ﬁfth) column
assumes that the costs are equal to the 25th (50th) percentile of the shorting costs for KfW bonds of
the corresponding currency on the same trading date. Standard errors are reported in parentheses.

The last three columns of Table III describe the proﬁts net of transaction
costs for the positive Australian dollar arbitrage and the negative Swiss franc,
euro, and Japanese yen arbitrages. The third column takes into account bid-
ask spreads on swaps and bonds, but not the bond short selling costs. The
negative-basis arbitrage strategy yields positive proﬁts for the Swiss franc,
euro, and Japanese yen for the majority of the sample, with averages ranging
from 9 to 22 basis points. The positive-basis arbitrage strategy of the Australian
dollar yields positive proﬁts only 10% of the time. The fourth and ﬁfth columns
report similar proﬁts also taking into account the cost of shorting KfW bonds.

proﬁts for between 30% and 50% of the sample for the Swiss franc and the
euro, and for around 75% of the sample for the Japanese yen. The positive-basis
arbitrage yields proﬁts for less than 5% of the sample for the Australian dollar.
While the Australian dollar does not exhibit signiﬁcant arbitrage opportunities
net of transaction costs, the Swiss franc, euro, and Japanese yen clearly do.
Assuming that arbitrageurs incur the median shorting fees prevalent on the
day of their transaction, average proﬁts range from 6 to 16 bps, with standard
deviations ranging from 5 to 12 bps. Again, the conditional volatility of such
strategies is zero and the conditional Sharpe ratio is inﬁnite for the ﬁxed
investment horizon of the bonds.

Can cross-country differences in the liquidity of KfW bonds explain the CIP
deviations? The answer depends on the currency pairs. For the euro and the
Australian dollar, differences in liquidity vis-`a-vis the U.S. dollar cannot ex-
plain CIP deviations; for the yen and the Swiss franc, they may.12

Finally, neither credit risk nor the covariance between credit risk and cur-
rency risk seem to explain CIP deviations for KfW yields. Even if there is a
small amount of credit risk embedded in KfW bonds, it should be similar across
currencies and thus should not have a ﬁrst-order effect on CIP deviations for
KfW yields.13 In theory, combining credit risk and exchange rate risk may ex-
plain the CIP deviations if the credit risk and exchange rate risk are correlated.
This is the case for the euro basis, as investors are likely to expect the euro
to depreciate against the dollar upon a KfW default. However, as explained in
Du and Schreger (2016), such a covariance adjustment should be very small in
magnitude because the credit spread of the KfW is small and directionally at
odds with a negative cross-currency basis for the euro.

Overall, deviations from CIP are present in many currency and ﬁxed in-
come markets, often leading to signiﬁcant arbitrage opportunities. In the next
section, we review potential causes of such arbitrage opportunities.

III. Potential Explanations

Deviations from CIP are at odds with frictionless ﬁnancial markets. In this
section, we hypothesize that the persistent and systematic CIP deviations can
be explained by a combination of two factors: (1) the balance sheet constraints

12 On the one hand, the liquidity of euro-denominated KfW bonds is at least comparable to, if
not better than, the liquidity of dollar-denominated bonds. Therefore, liquidity differences cannot
explain the positive arbitrage proﬁts of going long in euro bonds and shorting U.S. dollar bonds.
Likewise, the Australian dollar market, with an amount outstanding of around $21 billion, is
signiﬁcantly less liquid than the U.S. dollar market. Thus, the lower liquidity in the KfW Australian
market works against ﬁnding positive CIP arbitrage opportunities of going long in U.S. dollar-
denominated KfW bonds and shorting Australian dollar-denominated KfW bonds. On the other
hand, the Swiss franc and Japanese yen markets are comparatively small with total amounts
outstanding of less than $5 billion. As a result, the liquidity differential can be a potential factor
in explaining the positive proﬁts of going long in the more illiquid yen and Swiss franc KfW bonds
and shorting the more liquid dollar KfW bonds.

13 Since we are using debt of the same seniority, the pari passu clause should guarantee the

same recovery rate.

that ﬁnancial intermediaries face, which limit the size of exposure that can
be taken to narrow the CIP deviations, and (2) the international imbalances
in investment demand and funding supply across currencies, which affect the
demand for exchange rate forwards and swaps and, in turn, lead to CIP devia-
tions.

A. Balance Sheet Constraints of Financial Intermediaries

Before the global ﬁnancial crisis, global banks actively arbitraged funding
costs in the interbank markets across currencies and enforced the CIP con-
dition. Since the crisis, a wide range of regulatory reforms have signiﬁcantly
increased banks’ balance sheet costs of arbitrage and market making activities.
Bank regulations likely also affect other nonregulated entities, such as hedge
funds, increasing the cost of leverage for the overall ﬁnancial market. We con-
sider how the following banking regulations affect CIP arbitrages: (i) non-risk-
weighted capital requirements, or the leverage ratio, (ii) risk-weighted capital
requirements, and (iii) other banking regulations, such as the restrictions on
proprietary trading and the liquidity coverage ratio. Finally, we discuss lim-
its to arbitrage that other players, such as hedge funds, money market funds
(MMFs), foreign currency reserve managers, and corporate issuers face.

A.1. Non-Risk-Weighted Capital Requirements

Non-risk-weighted capital requirements are particularly relevant for short-
term CIP arbitrage. The leverage ratio requires banks to maintain a minimum
amount of capital against all on-balance-sheet assets and off-balance-sheet
exposure, regardless of their risk. Short-term CIP arbitrage trades have very
little market risk, but still expand bank balance sheets when levered since
they involve borrowing and lending in the cash markets and therefore make
the leverage ratio requirement more binding.14

For foreign banks, the leverage ratio did not exist before the crisis; it is
now equal to 3% under Basel III.15 For U.S. banks, while the leverage ratio
existed before the crisis, it became more stringent following the crisis with
the introduction of the supplementary leverage ratio, which is equal to 5%

14 Banks may arbitrage the CIP deviations as real money investors, selling dollar Treasury bills
and purchasing an equivalent value of yen Treasury bills. Such trades change the composition
of the assets without affecting the total size of the balance sheet, and thus have no effect on the
leverage ratio.

15 As noted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2014, p. 1), “Implementation of
the leverage ratio requirements has begun with bank-level reporting to national supervisors of the
leverage ratio and its components from 1 January 2013, and will proceed with public disclosure
starting 1 January 2015. The Committee will continue monitoring the impact of these disclosure
requirements. The ﬁnal calibration, and any further adjustments to the deﬁnition, will be com-
pleted by 2017, with a view to migrating to a Pillar 1 (minimum capital requirement) treatment
on 1 January 2018.” Even though there is no formal penalty during the observation period before
the rule ﬁnally kicks in on January 1, 2018, the leverage ratio has been a concern for European
banks due to the close monitoring by the regulatory authority and public disclosure requirements.

to 6% for systematically important ﬁnancial institutions. The leverage ratio
requirement is likely to be acting as a constraint on bank balance sheets. A
simple back-of-the-envelope approximation illustrates the impact of a leverage
ratio equal to 3% that binds. If we assume that banks need to maintain 3%
of their capital against CIP arbitrage trades, and that their overall objective
in terms of the rate of return on capital is around 10%, then banks need at
least a 3% × 10% = 30 bps cross-currency basis to engage in the trade.16 Thus,
many of the arbitrage opportunities that are balance sheet-intensive may not be
sufﬁciently attractive for banks: as balance sheet expansion becomes expensive
due to the leverage ratio requirement, banks may limit or even shy away from
CIP arbitrage.

The Basel Committee recommends that the leverage ratio be disclosed at
minimum at the quarter-end. The actual method used to calculate the leverage
ratio differs across jurisdictions. For European banks, effective January 2015,
the European Leverage Ratio Delegated Act changes the deﬁnition of this ratio
from the average of the month-ends over a quarter to the point-in-time quarter-
end ratio. For U.S. banks, the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based
on the daily average balances across the quarter. Furthermore, mandatory
public disclosure of the leverage ratio for European banks began in January
2015. Since European banks play an important role intermediating U.S. dollars
offshore, we expect the quarter-end dynamics to be particularly pronounced
since January 2015.

A.2. Risk-Weighted Capital Requirements

From the perspective of risk-weighted capital, global banks face signiﬁcantly
higher capital requirements since the global ﬁnancial crisis. For example, for
the eight U.S. globally systematically important banks (G-SIBs), the Tier 1
capital ratio increased from 4% precrisis to the 9.5% to 13% range under Basel
III, and the total capital ratio increased from 8% to the 11.5% to 15% range.
In addition to higher capital ratios against risk-weighted assets (RWAs), the
estimation of RWA itself also increased signiﬁcantly due to more stringent
capital rules and the higher volatility of the cross-currency basis.

The central component of the RWA calculation for a CIP trade is the 99%
value-at-risk (VaR) measure based on 10-business-day holding-period returns,
typically calculated over a window that corresponds to the past calendar year.
Since one-week arbitrage opportunities exhibit zero VaR, RWA constraints mat-
ter only for long-term CIP arbitrages. Basel II.5 (effective January 2013 in the
United States) introduced an additional “stress-VaR” (SVaR) calibrated for the
stress period. As Figure 4 shows, the cross-currency basis became signiﬁcantly
more volatile following the crisis, thus increasing the VaR on the CIP trade.

16 Even if the leverage ratio requirement does not bind, banks might prefer to maintain some
buffer over the minimum leverage ratio requirement, in which case the leverage ratio would still
matter. For an alternative approach that takes into account the debt overhang effect, see Darrell
Duffﬁe’s article “The covered interest parity conundrum” on Risk.net (March 17, 2017).

In the Internet Appendix, where we focus on a speciﬁc ﬁve-year Libor CIP ar-
bitrage trade, we show that its capital charge theoretically increases 10 times
following the crisis. In practice, capital charges are more difﬁcult to estimate
as they depend on the whole portfolio, not just a single trade. But this simple
example shows that risk-weighted requirements very likely increased the costs
of long-term CIP arbitrage strategies.

A.3. Other Banking Regulations

A host of other ﬁnancial regulations have also reduced banks’ willingness
to engage in CIP arbitrage. For example, the Volcker Rule (a part of the
Dodd-Frank Act) forbids banks from actively engaging in proprietary trad-
ing activities. Proprietary trading in spot exchange rates is allowed, but not
in exchange rate forwards and swaps. As a result, banks can only engage in
market-making or facilitate the arbitrage activities of their clients in the ex-
change rate derivative markets. In practice, however, the distinction between
arbitrage and market-making may be difﬁcult to draw. In addition, the over-
the-counter derivatives market reform sets higher capital and minimum mar-
gin requirements for cross-currency swaps, which are generally uncleared by
central counterparties, further increasing the capital necessary to implement
the CIP trade.

In addition to the new risk-weighted capital rules and the leverage ratio,
the Basel III agreement introduces the liquidity coverage ratio, which requires
banks to hold high-quality liquidity assets (HQLAs) against potential net cash
outﬂows during a 30-day stress period, where the expected inﬂows are equal
at most to 75% of the expected outﬂows. The impact of the CIP trade is com-
plex. When the 75% cap is binding, the CIP trade can deteriorate the liquidity
coverage ratio. Investing in HQLAs, for example, central bank reserves, could,
however, improve the liquidity coverage ratio.

A.4. Limits to Arbitrage Facing Other Potential Arbitrageurs

We turn now to the other potential arbitrageurs, that is, hedge funds, MMFs,
reserve managers, and corporate issuers. For each category, we brieﬂy review
its ability to proﬁt from, and thus attenuate the CIP deviations, along with
its potential constraints. The persistence of CIP deviations suggests that these
potential arbitrageurs take only limited positions.

The regulatory reforms on banks certainly have some spillover effects on the
cost of leverage that nonregulated entities, such as hedge funds, face. This is
because hedge funds need to obtain funding from their prime brokers, which
are regulated entities. In order to sell the CIP arbitrage strategy to their clients,
hedge funds would need to lever up the arbitrage strategy 10 or 20 times to
make it attractive. When borrowing large amounts, their borrowing costs may
increase signiﬁcantly as their positions show up in their prime brokers’ balance
sheets (making prime brokers’ capital requirements more binding).

The Journal of Finance R(cid:3)

U.S. prime MMFs hold large amounts of commercial paper (CP) and cer-
tiﬁcates of deposit (CDs) issued by foreign banks and act as an important
alternative source of dollar funding to foreign banks. The recent MMF reform
has a signiﬁcant impact on the intermediation capacity of prime MMFs. The
reform requires a ﬂoating net asset value for prime MMFs and allows gates
and fees to limit redemptions for prime funds, which led to large outﬂows of
funds from prime MMFs to government MMFs. Government MMFs do not hold
bank CDs or CP. In the run-up to the MMF reform implementation (October
14, 2016), as dollar funding from U.S. prime MMFs became scarcer and more
expensive, the cross-currency basis also widened notably.

In addition to MMFs, FX reserve managers with large dollar-denominated
holdings may arbitrage CIP deviations. For example, the People’s Bank of
China reportedly increased its holdings of Japanese Treasury bills, which, on
the swapped basis, quadrupled yields on U.S. Treasury bills.17 In addition, as
of June 30, 2016, more than half of the foreign currency assets at the Reserve
Bank of Australia are denominated in Japanese yen, with more than 90% of
the yen-denominated assets swapped into other currencies (Reserve Bank of
Australia (2016)).

Last but not the least, corporate issuers and bank treasuries can also arbi-
trage long-term CIP deviations by issuing long-term debt in different currencies
and then swapping into their desired currency. In the Internet Appendix, we re-
port additional evidence on the CIP condition for bond yields of the same risky
issuer denominated in different currencies. Using a panel including global
banks, multinational nonﬁnancial ﬁrms, and supranational institutions, we
show that the issuer-speciﬁc basis was close to zero precrisis but has been per-
sistently different from zero postcrisis. Large differences in CIP bases appear
postcrisis across issuers due to differences in funding costs over respective Li-
bor benchmarks. Relative to the synthetic dollar rate obtained by swapping
foreign currency interest rates, foreign banks generally borrow in U.S. dollars
directly at higher costs, whereas U.S. banks and supranational institutions
generally borrow in U.S. dollars directly at lower costs. As a result, U.S. banks
and supranational institutions are in the best position to arbitrage the negative
cross-currency basis, especially during periods of ﬁnancial distress.

A.5. Testable Hypothesis

In summary, the rules on and behavior of banks have changed since the
crisis, offering a potential explanation for the CIP deviations and suggesting
some simple predictions.

PREDICTION 1:
(i) CIP deviations are wider when banks’ balance sheet costs
are higher, particularly toward quarter-end ﬁnancial reporting dates; (ii) CIP
deviations are of similar magnitude to the balance sheet costs associated with

17 See the article “World’s Biggest Bond Traders Undeterred by Negative Yields” in Bloomberg,

August 21, 2016.

939

wholesale dollar funding; and (iii) CIP deviations are correlated with other
near-risk-free ﬁxed income spreads.

Constraints on ﬁnancial intermediaries are a likely driver of the overall in-
crease in CIP deviations postcrisis. In the absence of currency-speciﬁc trading
costs, frictions to ﬁnancial intermediation would likely affect all currencies
similarly. Yet, large cross-currency differences exist in the data. This points to
hedging demand arising from international imbalances in funding and invest-
ment opportunities across currencies.

B. International Imbalances

The second element of our two-factor hypothesis works as follows. Search-for-
yield motives create large customer demand for investments in high-interest-
rate currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, and a large
supply of savings in low-interest-rate currencies, such as the Japanese yen
and Swiss franc. Japanese life insurance companies, for example, may look
for high yields in the U.S. Treasury markets (instead of investing in the low
yield, yen-based Treasuries). Part of such investments is certainly currency-
hedged, for example, Japanese life insurers sell dollars and buy yen forward
to hedge their U.S. Treasury bond portfolios. Financial intermediaries, such
as FX swap market makers, supply currency hedging but do not want to bear
the currency risk. To that end, ﬁnancial intermediaries hedge the currency
exposure of their forward and swap positions in the cash market by going long
in low-interest-rate currencies and short in high-interest-rate currencies. The
proﬁt per unit of notional is equal to the absolute value of the cross-currency
basis, compensating the intermediary for the cost of capital associated with the
trade. This hypothesis leads to the following prediction.

PREDICTION 2: The cross-currency basis is increasing in the nominal interest
rate differential between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar.

The intuition behind the above prediction is that the lower the foreign cur-
rency interest rate compared to the U.S. interest rate, the higher the demand
for U.S. dollar-denominated investment opportunities, which generates greater
currency-hedging demand to sell U.S. dollars and buy foreign currencies in the
forward or the swap market. Since providing these currency-hedging contracts
is costly for ﬁnancial intermediaries, the cross-currency basis has to become
more negative to justify the higher balance sheet costs associated with larger
positions.

With the two-factor hypotheses in mind, we turn now to additional empirical

evidence on CIP deviations.

IV. Characteristics of the Basis

In this section, we characterize the systematic nature of the basis and test the
two predictions outlined in the previous section, looking at (i) CIP deviations

at quarter-ends, (ii) a proxy for the cost of wholesale dollar funding, (iii) the
correlation of the CIP deviations with other liquidity spreads, and (iv) the
correlation with nominal interest rates.

A. Quarter-End Dynamics

We ﬁnd that, since the 2007 to 2008 global ﬁnancial crisis, one-week and one-
month CIP deviations tend to increase at the quarter-ends for contracts that
cross quarter-end reporting dates. The quarter-end anomalies have become
more pronounced since January 2015, which coincides with the change in the
leverage ratio calculation method and the beginning of the public disclosure of
the leverage ratio for European banks. These ﬁndings are consistent with the
view that tightened balance sheet constraints at quarter-ends, due to banking
regulation, translate into wider CIP deviations in the postcrisis period.

A.1. Quarter-End Effects on the Level of CIP Deviations

To build intuition, Figure 5 focuses on the yen starting in 2015. Banks may
experience speciﬁc demands on the last day of each quarter, but our identiﬁ-
cation strategy relies on what happens either one week or one month before
the quarter-ends. The blue-shaded area denotes the dates for which one-week
contracts cross quarter-end reporting dates. The gray area denotes the dates

 15406261, 2018, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12620 by KIZ der Universitat Ulm, Wiley Online Library on [20/11/2024].

for which the one-month contract crosses quarter-end reporting dates, but one-
week contracts stay within the quarter. The ﬁgure plots the one-week, one-
month, and three-month CIP deviations in levels. It is clear that once the
one-month contract crosses the quarter-end, the one-month CIP deviation in-
creases in absolute value. Likewise, once the one-week contract crosses the
quarter-end, the one-week CIP deviation increases in absolute value. No simi-
lar pattern obtains for the three-month CIP deviations. With these patterns in
mind, we turn to a formal causality test.

We test whether CIP deviations are more pronounced at the end of quarters
versus any other point in time, particularly since the global ﬁnancial crisis and
since 2015. Our simple difference-in-difference test for the one-week contract
takes the form

− x1w,it = αi + β1 QendWt + β2 QendWt × Post07t + β3 QendWt × Post15t

+γ1 Post07t + γ2 Post15t + it,

where x1w,it is the one-week basis for currency i at time t, αi is a currency ﬁxed
effect, P OST 07t is an indicator variable equal to one after January 1, 2007
and zero otherwise, and P OST 15t is an indicator variable equal to one after
January 1, 2015 and zero otherwise.18 The variable QendWt is an indicator
variable that equals one if the settlement date for the contract traded at t is
within the last week of the current quarter and the maturity date is in the
following quarter.19 These one-week contracts crossing the quarter-ends show
up on the bank balance sheet on quarter-end reporting dates. The regression
is estimated on the daily sample from 01/01/2000 to 09/15/2016 on one-week
Libor, overnight interest rate swap (OIS), and repo bases.20 Similarly, we test
the quarter-end effect for the monthly CIP deviation using

− x1m,it = αi + β1QendMt + β2QendMt × Post07t + β3QendMt × Post15t

+γ1Post07t + γ2Post15t + it,

where QendMt is a binary variable indicating whether the settlement date and
maturity date of the monthly contract span two quarters.

Table IV reports the regression results. Columns (1) to (3) pertain to the
one-week CIP deviations based on Libor, OIS, and repos. The slope coefﬁcients

absolute value of the basis.

18 Since most currencies have a negative basis, we obtain almost identical results using the
19 FX forwards follow the T + 2 settlement convention.
20 Banks can borrow without collateral at the daily federal funds rate and then swap these daily
rates for a weekly rate to avoid any interest rate risk over one week. By doing so, banks effectively
borrow at the OIS rate for one week. As long as banks can borrow at the effective daily federal
funds rate, no matter how high or low this rate is, the banks are not subject to interest rate risk.
Recent data by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggest that banks do indeed borrow at
rates very close to the effective daily federal funds rate. From March 2016 to May 2017, the 75th
percentile of the spread between the actual borrowing rate and the effective borrowing rate is only
0.7 bps on average; the 99th percentile is 13 bps on average. As a result, only banks in distress
would bear some interest rate risk.

β2 and β3 are positive and statistically signiﬁcant across all three instruments.
The quarter-end CIP deviation relative to the mean deviation in the rest of
the quarter is on average 9 to 31 bps higher in the post-2007 sample than
in the pre-2007 sample for the one-week contracts.21 Furthermore, compared
to the post-2007 sample, the quarter-end weekly CIP deviation increases by
another 30 to 40 bps on average since January 2015. Columns (4) to (6) pertain
to the one-month CIP deviations. Again, we ﬁnd that β2 and β3 are consistently
signiﬁcantly positive except in one case. For CIP deviations based on Libor
and OIS rates, the month-end deviation relative to the rest of the quarter is
on average 3 to 5 bps higher postcrisis than precrisis and increases by an-
other 8 bps in the post-2015 sample. For the one-month repo, while β3 is not

signiﬁcant, β2 is highly signiﬁcant and equals 14 bps. Furthermore, we note
that the coefﬁcients on QendWt and QendMt are very small and largely insignif-
icant, suggesting that there is very little quarter-end effect before 2007.22

A.2. Quarter-End Effects on the Term Structure of CIP Deviations

Since a three-month forward contract always shows up in a quarterly re-
port regardless of when it is executed within the quarter, we should not ex-
pect discrete price movement one week or one month prior to the quarter-
end. Therefore, the quarter-end balance sheet constraint has implications for
the term structure of the basis. In particular, we expect the difference be-
tween the three-month and one-month CIP deviation (tst,3M−1M ≡ xt,3M − xt,1M)
to drop signiﬁcantly once the one-month contract crosses the quarter-end.
Meanwhile, the difference between the one-month and one-week CIP deviation
(tst,1M−1W ≡ xt,1M − xt,1W) should ﬁrst increase signiﬁcantly as the one-month
contract crosses the quarter-end and then decrease signiﬁcantly once the one-
week contract crosses the quarter-end.

Table V conﬁrms these predictions in panel regressions. Columns (1) to (3) re-
port regression results using tst,3M−1M based on Libor, OIS, and repo as follows,
similar to equation (14):
− tst,3M−1M = αi + β1QendMt + β2QendMt × Post07t + β3QendMt × Post15t
(15)

+γ1Post07t + γ2Post15t + it.

We ﬁnd that β1 is small and insigniﬁcant, while β2 and β3 are signiﬁcantly
negative. Compared to the precrisis sample, −tst,3M−1M is 2.3 bps lower relative
to its mean in the rest of the quarter when the one-month contract crosses the
quarter-ends in the postcrisis sample. In the post-2015 sample, the quarter-end
effect corresponds to another 10 bps reduction in −tst,3M−1M compared to its
postcrisis mean. Columns (4) to (6) report similar tests for tss,1M−1W:
−tst,1M−1W = αi + β1IQendMt=1,QendWt=0 + β2IQendMt=1,QendWt=0 × Post07t

+β3IQendMt=1,QendWt=0×Post15t+β4QendWt+β5QendWt×Post07t
+β6QendWt × Post15t + γ1Post07t + γ2Post15t + it,

where IQendMt=1,QendWt=0 is an indicator variable that equals one if a one-month
contract traded at t crosses the quarter-end but the one-week contract traded
at t does not cross the quarter-end. As expected, we ﬁnd signiﬁcantly positive
β2 and β3 coefﬁcients and signiﬁcantly negative β5 and β6 coefﬁcients, which
suggests that the difference between one-month and one-week CIP deviations
ﬁrst increases as the once-month contract crosses the quarter-end but the one-
week contract does not, and then decreases as the one-week contract crosses

22 The magnitude of the quarter-end effect varies across currencies. The effect is strongest for
the Japanese yen, likely reﬂecting the importance of the continental European banks subject to
the quarter-end regulatory reporting in intermediating dollars to Japan.

Quarter-End Effects on the Term Structure of CIP Deviations

This table reports regression results on (the negative of) the term structure of daily one-week
and one-month Libor, OIS, and GC repo bases. QendMt is an indicator variable that equals one if
the one-month contract traded at t crosses quarter-ends and equals zero otherwise. QendWt is an
indicator variable that equals one if the one-week contract traded at t crosses quarter-ends and
equals zero otherwise. IQendMt=1,QendWt=0 is an indicator variable that equals one if QendMt = 1
and QendWt = 0 and equals zero otherwise. Post07 is an indicator variable that equals one if the
trading date t is on or after 01/01/2007 and equals zero otherwise. Post15 is an indicator variable
that equals one if the trading date t is on or after 01/01/2015 and equals zero otherwise. All
regressions include currency ﬁxed effects. Columns (1), (2), (4), and (5) use all sample currencies.
Columns (3) and (6) include only the Danish krone, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc
due to the lack of good term repo data for other currencies. Newey-West standard errors shown in
parentheses are used with 90-day lags. *, **, and *** denote signiﬁcance levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%
conﬁdence levels. The sample period is 1/1/2000 to 09/15/2016.

the quarter-end. These quarter-end effects are again larger in the postcrisis
period and especially since 2015.

In summary, consistent with the key role of banks’ balance sheets on quarter-
end reporting dates, we ﬁnd that CIP deviations are systematically larger for
contracts that cross quarter-end reporting dates after the crisis. We do not
pin down which part of the regulation matters most, but we show that banking
regulation affects asset prices. The quarter-end anomalies in the cross-currency

markets, driven by “window dressing” for better regulatory capital ratios, are
consistent with the sharp quarter-end decline in the U.S. Triparty repo volume
(Munyan (2015)) and the quarter-end increase in the spread between repo rates
in the GFC market and the tri-party markets.23

B. CIP Arbitrage Based on Excess Reserves at Central Banks

We now compare a proxy for banks’ balance sheet costs to the CIP deviations.
Under unconventional monetary policies implemented by major central banks
since the global ﬁnancial crisis, global depositary institutions have held large
amounts of excess reserves at major central banks (e.g., $2.4 trillion at the Fed
and $0.5 trillion at the ECB in 2016). Excess reserves are remunerated at a
rate set by the central bank, namely, the IOER.

The IOER at the Fed is often above interest rates paid on private money
market instruments (for example, the federal funds rate) because government-
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), such as the Federal Home Loan Banks, do not
have access to the IOER deposit facility and are net lenders. This creates
the well-known IOER-federal funds arbitrage for depositary institutions with
access to the IOER deposit facility: Banks borrow in the federal funds market
from the GSEs and deposit the proceeds in the form of excess reserves at the
Fed, earning the IOER-federal funds spread. The trade is risk-free, and central
bank reserve balances dominate private money market instruments in terms
of liquidity and fungibility.

Figure 6 shows the IOER, one-week OIS, Libor, and repo rates for the U.S.
dollar since 2009. The IOER is always greater than the one-week OIS rate
over the entire sample and is also greater than the one-week Libor and repo
rates for most of the sample. If borrowing funds did not carry additional costs,
banks would demand more reserves at the Fed in order to proﬁt from this
arbitrage opportunity, and the interest rate gap between IOER and private
money instruments would disappear. The spread earned on the IOER-private
money market instrument arbitrage thus provides a concrete measure of the
cost of balance sheet expansion for depository institutions that engage in risk-
free arbitrage opportunities.24

23 More details on the GFC-Triparty repo spread can be found in the Internet Appendix.
24 This cost includes at least two components. For U.S. and foreign banks, the cost of leverage,
summarized in leverage ratios, is likely to be the most important factor since the trade is risk-free,
but still expands the size of banks’ balance sheet. For U.S. banks, an additional cost matters:
the deposit insurance fees paid on wholesale funding, which mattered after the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) widened the assessment base for deposit insurance fees to include
wholesale funding in April 2011. In other words, the IOER is the opportunity cost of wholesale
dollar funding for depository institutions, and the synthetic dollar interest rates by swapping
foreign currency investments have to be higher than the IOER to attract banks to engage in CIP
trades, instead of parking the dollars as excess reserves at the Fed. Consistent with our CIP
evidence, the gap between the IOER and the federal funds rate widens at quarter-ends if we use
the overnight federal funds rate instead of the one-week OIS rate. This is because the IOER-federal
funds arbitrage is typically done at the overnight horizon.

Figure 6. IOER, OIS, repo, and Libor rates for the U.S. dollar. This ﬁgure plots the one-week
interest on excess reserves (IOER), overnight interest swap (OIS), GC repo, and Libor rates for the
U.S. dollar from 1/1/2009 to 09/15/2016. (Color ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)

Therefore, instead of using the Libor (OIS or repo) rate to capture direct
U.S. dollar funding costs when computing the cross-currency basis, we use
the IOER. This is equivalent to assuming, for example, that banks borrow at
the Libor (OIS or repo) rate and that the difference between the IOER minus the
Libor (OIS or repo) rate proxies for banks’ balance sheet costs. Table VI reports
the results using this alternative basis calculation. Compared to the standard
Libor basis reported in the ﬁrst column, “funding” at the IOER reduces the
magnitude of the Libor basis by 6 bps on average, as shown in the second
column. Similarly, compared to the standard OIS basis reported in the third
column, the basis is 12 bps narrower when using the IOER instead of the OIS to
capture direct dollar funding costs, as shown in the fourth column. Compared
to the standard repo basis, the basis is 8 bps narrower when using the IOER
to capture funding costs, as shown in the sixth column. Therefore, the gap
between the IOER and OIS/Libor/repo in the United States can explain about
one-third of the one-week CIP deviations.

The CIP arbitrage based on Libor, OIS, and repo rates has a neutral effect
on the liquidity coverage ratio at best, but the IOER-federal funds arbitrage
can potentially improve the liquidity coverage ratio.25 Also, more generally,
central bank balances are considered safer and more liquid than any private

25 The IOER-federal funds arbitrage can improve the liquidity coverage ratio in two potential
ways. First, the IOER-federal funds arbitrage increases the numerator and the denominator by
the same amount, which leads to a mechanical increase in the ratio, especially for large positions.
Second, if the bank were subject to the composition cap for eligible Level-2 high-quality liquid

market alternatives even before being codiﬁed as Level-1 high-quality liquid
assets (HQLA) by the Basel liquidity coverage ratio requirement. To take into
account the better liquidity of central bank balances, we assume that banks
fund themselves at the U.S. IOER (as above) and invest at the foreign IOER.
Summary statistics for the IOER basis are reported in the last column of Table
VI. The average IOER basis is −8 bps, much closer to zero than the Libor and
OIS basis at −26 and −28 bps, respectively.26

Using the IOER-Libor spread to account for banks’ balance sheet costs and
investing at the foreign central bank deposit facility signiﬁcantly reduces the
size of the CIP deviations, but does not eliminate them. For the Danish krone,
the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen, the CIP deviations still range from −12

assets (HQLA) (40% of total HQLAs), adding reserve balances (Level-1 HQLA) may permit the
inclusion of additional eligible Level-2 assets in the numerator of the liquidity coverage ratio.

26 The Internet Appendix reports the time series of the IOER basis, together with the Libor
basis and the modiﬁed Libor basis obtained by “funding” at the IOER. The bases based on the
IOER can be positive, while the Libor basis is always negative. A positive IOER basis would lead
U.S. banks to park excess reserves at the Fed, as opposed to lend out U.S. dollars in the case of a
negative Libor basis. Increasing reserves at the Fed further reduces bank ﬂows to arbitrage the
Libor basis.

to −15 bps on average.27 Such CIP deviations imply a risk-free arbitrage op-
portunity for global depository institutions that can borrow U.S. dollars in the
wholesale cash funding market and deposit at the foreign central bank deposit
facility while hedging currency risk, even after accounting for their balance
sheet costs. Banks are either factoring in higher shadow costs, or are willing
to forgo some extra yield to hold Fed balances over swapped balances at the
Bank of Japan, the Swiss National Bank, or the Danish National Bank, even
though these central bank reserve balances are all risk-free HQLAs. One po-
tential explanation is that Fed balances are more desirable for fulﬁlling banks’
dollar liquidity needs compared to swapped foreign central bank balances, even
though there is no hardwired liquidity coverage ratio imposed at the individual
currency level.

In summary, by assuming that banks borrow and invest at the IOER, we
proxy for banks’ balance sheet costs associated with the leverage ratio and ac-
count for the liquidity advantage of central bank reserve balances over private
money market instruments. These adjustments correspond to approximately
two-thirds of the average CIP deviations.

C. Correlated Spreads in Other Markets

Intermediary constraints, if present, would likely affect other asset classes
beyond exchange rates. We thus compare the dynamics of the currency bases to
other types of near-arbitrage ﬁxed-income strategies, focusing on (1) the KfW-
German bund basis, (2) the one- versus three-month U.S. Libor tenor swap
basis, (3) the CDS-CDX basis, and (4) the CDS and corporate bond (CDS-bond)
basis. Each of these strategies is detailed in the Internet Appendix. Figure 7
plots the average of the absolute value of the ﬁve-year Libor currency basis for
G10 currencies and the four other types of bases in four different panels.

The currency basis appears highly correlated with the two liquidity-based
bases, that is, the KfW-German bund basis and the Libor tenor basis. They
all increased during the recent global ﬁnancial crisis and the European debt
crisis. Although there is no mechanical link between the CIP deviations and
the KfW-bund and Libor tenor swap bases, their comovement is striking.

The currency basis appears less correlated with the two credit bases, that
is, the CDS-CDX basis and the bond-CDS basis. Both credit bases increased
signiﬁcantly during the recent global ﬁnancial crisis, together with the cross-
currency basis, but they narrowed signiﬁcantly after the crisis between 2010
and 2014, whereas the currency basis did not. Between 2014 and 2016, the
credit and currency bases appear to move in sync again.

We test the link across asset classes with a simple regression of the G10
average changes in the cross-currency bases on changes in the four other liq-
uidity and credit bases for the 2005 to 2016 and 2010 to 2016 samples. The

27 In the euro area, since the euro overnight index average (EONIA) is signiﬁcantly higher than
the ECB deposit rate (unlike in the United States), the CIP arbitrage involving euro borrowing
and Fed deposits is rarely proﬁtable despite the 8 bps average IOER basis for the euro.

results are reported in the Internet Appendix. In the full sample, which in-
cludes the global ﬁnancial crisis, the CIP deviations comove signiﬁcantly with
the four other spreads. In the postcrisis sample, the CIP deviations continue to
comove signiﬁcantly with the two liquidity spreads, while the correlation with
the two credit spreads remains positive but is no longer signiﬁcant. Overall,
the correlation between the CIP deviations and other near-arbitrage strategies,
especially the KfW-German bund basis and the Libor tenor basis, is consistent
with a key role for liquidity-providing intermediaries.

D. Cross-Currency Basis and Nominal Interest Rates

Consistent with Prediction 2, we ﬁnd that CIP deviations are highly corre-
lated with nominal interest rates both in the cross section and in the time series.

D.1. Cross Section of CIP Deviations and Interest Rates

We ﬁrst document a robust cross-sectional relationship between nominal
interest rates and various types of cross-currency basis. We ﬁnd that low-
interest-rate currencies tend to have most negative bases and high-interest-
rate currencies tend to have less negative bases or positive bases. Figure 8
plots the mean cross-currency basis on the vertical axis as a function of the
average nominal interest rates between 2010 and 2015 on the horizontal axis.
The Libor cross-currency basis is positively correlated with Libor rates at short
and long maturities. The relationship is particularly strong at long maturities,
with the correlation between ﬁve-year Libor bases and Libor rates equal to 90%
for G10 currencies.28

Therefore, for a long-short arbitrageur, there exist arbitrage opportunities
for going long in low-interest-rate currencies, and short in high-interest-rate
currencies, with the currency risk hedged using exchange rate swaps. The
direction of the arbitrage trade is exactly the opposite of the conventional
unhedged carry trade of going long in high-interest-rate currencies and short
in low-interest-rate currencies.29 This ﬁnding has clear implications for carry
trade investors and multinational issuers.

For carry trade investors, the CIP deviations make the carry trade more
proﬁtable on the forward than on the cash markets.30 The unhedged currency
excess return is

28 Similarly, as shown in the Internet Appendix, we obtain a very high correlation between the
average level of interest rates and the CIP deviations measured on bonds issued by KfW and other
multinationals. By contrast, the mean CDS spread of the interbank panel exhibits a correlation of
−33% with the ﬁve-year Libor basis.

29 Note that the average CIP deviations and average carry trade excess returns differ by an
order of magnitude: less than 50 bps for the CIP deviations and more than 500 bps for average
carry trade excess returns.

For any investor who borrows in U.S. dollars (or yen) and invests in Australian
(or New Zealand) dollars, the CIP basis is positive (xt > 0). As a result, the
carry trade excess return obtained from forward contracts, ft − st+1, is larger
than the excess return obtained on the cash markets, yt − y$
For multinational issuers with diversiﬁed clienteles, the cross-sectional pat-
tern has a simple funding cost implication: if they want to obtain U.S. dollars,
they are better off borrowing in high- than in low-interest-rate currencies and
then swapping their debt into U.S. dollars. Consistent with this ﬁnding, we
present evidence in the Internet Appendix that diversiﬁed supranational is-
suers issue disproportionately more in high-interest-rate currencies than in
low-interest-rate currencies.

D.2. Time Series of CIP Deviations and Interest Rates

As in the cross section, the nominal interest rate differential between two
currencies is also a signiﬁcant driver of the cross-currency basis in the time
series. Assuming that the monetary policy is exogenous to the basis, an event
study of a narrow window around the ECB monetary policy announcements
shows the effect of unexpected shocks to the interest rate differential on the
cross-currency basis.

Our event study focuses on changes in the dollar/euro basis and changes in
the yield differential between German bunds and U.S. Treasuries. The event
window starts ﬁve minutes before the release of the monetary decision, usually
at 1:45 pm Central European Time (CET), and ends 105 minutes after the
release of the statement, thus including the one-hour press conference that
usually takes place between 2:30 pm CET and 3:30 pm CET. By choosing such
a narrow event window, the movements in the currency basis and government
yields can be attributed to monetary policy shocks from the ECB. Intraday data
come from the Thomson Reuters Tick History database. The cross-currency
basis corresponds to over-the-counter quotes from a major European bank for a
Euribor/U.S. Libor one-year maturity basis contract.31 The event study focuses
on ECB announcements because quotes on the currency basis are available at
high frequency for the euro.

We regress the change in the cross-currency basis around the ith monetary
policy announcement (xi) on changes in the German bund and U.S. Treasury

31 Cross-currency bases at tenors longer than one year are not quoted frequently enough for our
event study. The three-month cross-currency basis was not actively traded as a separate derivative
product until 2012. However, our results are robust to using the three-month basis since it became
separately quoted.

Figure 9. Monetary policy shocks and deviations from CIP. This ﬁgure plots intraday
changes in the two-year German bund and U.S. Treasury yield differential around the ECB mone-
tary policy announcements on the horizontal axis and intraday changes in the one-year euro/dollar
cross-currency basis around the same time on the vertical axis. All intraday data are from Thom-
son Reuters Tick History. The sample period is from 1/1/2010 to 10/30/2015. (Color ﬁgure can be
viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)

In the cross section, as we saw, the cross-currency basis tends to increase with
the interest rate differential. Similar behavior would imply a positive slope
coefﬁcient, β > 0. As Figure 9 shows, this is clearly the case: in the time series,
the cross-currency basis tends to increase with the interest rate differential.
The slope coefﬁcient on the interest rate differential in equation (17) is equal to
0.15 with a t-statistic of 5.88. Therefore, a 10 bps reduction in the German/U.S.
Treasury two-year yield differential due to an accommodative ECB monetary
policy shock would lead to a 1.5 bps reduction in the one-year euro/dollar
Libor CIP deviations. More accommodative-than-expected monetary policy by
the ECB thus results in a more negative cross-currency basis for the euro,
implying that the synthetic dollar rate increases compared to the direct dollar
rate, making the indirect dollar funding of European banks more expensive
than before the announcement.

V. Conclusion

In this paper, we examine the persistent and systematic failures of the CIP
condition in the postcrisis period. After formally establishing the existence of
CIP arbitrage opportunities based on repo rates and KfW bonds, we argue that
these arbitrage opportunities can be rationalized by the interaction between
costly ﬁnancial intermediation and international imbalances in funding sup-
ply and investment demand across currencies. Consistent with this two-factor

 15406261, 2018, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12620 by KIZ der Universitat Ulm, Wiley Online Library on [20/11/2024].

hypothesis, we identify four empirical characteristics of the CIP deviations.
First, the CIP deviations increase at the quarter-ends following the crisis, es-
pecially for contracts that appear on banks’ quarter-end balance sheets. Second,
proxies for banks’ balance sheet costs account for two-thirds of the CIP devia-
tions. Third, the CIP deviations comove with other near-risk-free ﬁxed-income
spreads. Fourth, the CIP deviations are highly correlated with nominal interest
rates both in the cross section and in the time series.

Looking beyond our paper, we expect a large literature to further investigate
the CIP deviations. These deviations persist in one of the largest and most
liquid markets in the world in the absence of ﬁnancial distress, which suggests
that other arbitrage opportunities exist elsewhere. While trading in exchange
rate derivatives is a zero-sum game, the CIP deviations may have large welfare
implications because of the implied deadweight cost borne by ﬁrms seeking to
hedge their cash ﬂows. Furthermore, the existence of CIP deviations intro-
duces wedges between the interest rates in the cash and swap markets, which
affects the external transmission of monetary policy. The welfare cost of the
CIP deviations is beyond the scope of this paper as it would necessitate a gen-
eral equilibrium model. Yet, even without such a model, the CIP condition is a
clean laboratory to test the impact of ﬁnancial frictions in a general framework.
In this spirit, we present the ﬁrst international evidence on the causal impact
of recent banking regulations on asset prices. We expect more research in this
direction in the future.

Appendix: Data Appendix

In this appendix, we provide a brief overview of the data sources used in the
paper. Detailed Bloomberg or Reuters tickers of the data series can be found in
the Internet Appendix.

Exchange Rates: Daily spot exchange rates and forward points come from
Bloomberg using London closing rates for G10 currencies. Mid rates (aver-
age of bid and ask rates) are used for benchmark basis calculations. Daily
Libor/interbank ﬁxing rates are also obtained from Bloomberg.

Benchmark Interbank Rates: We use the following benchmark interest
rates from Bloomberg for our sample currencies: Australian dollar (AUD): Bank
Bill Swap Rate (BBSW); Canadian dollar (CAD): Canadian Dollar Offered Rate
(CDOR); Swiss franc (CHF): London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR); Danish
krone (DKK): Copenhagen Interbank Offered Rate (CIBOR); Euro (EUR): Euro
Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR); British pound (GBP): LIBOR; Japanese
yen (JPY): LIBOR; Norwegian krone (NOK): Norwegian Interbank Offered

Rate (NIBOR); New Zealand dollar (NZD): Bank Bill Market Rate (BKBM);
and Swedish krona (SEK): Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate (STIBOR). We
follow the market day count conventions for these interest rates: 365/ACT
for the commonwealth currencies (AUD/CAD/GBP/NZD), and 360/ACT for the
other currencies.

GC Repo Rates: U.S. bid and ask repo rates come from the Thomson Reuters
Tick History database. The mid rates are very close to the daily GC repo quotes
from JP Morgan (obtained from Morgan Markets), one of the only two clearing
banks to settle tri-party U.S. repo markets.

The euro mid repo data are based on German bunds as collateral and are
obtained from Bloomberg. Similar series from JP Morgan are very close to
the Bloomberg series, but shorter. Bid and ask rates on euro repos are avail-
able from Thomson Reuters Eikon. We do not use the Thomson Reuters Eikon
GC euro rates in our baseline calculation because eligible collateral also in-
cludes sovereign bonds in other European countries besides the German bunds.
Thomson Reuters Eikon euro GC repo rates are persistently higher than the
Bloomberg rates, and thus imply larger arbitrage proﬁts than the reported
results.

Swiss franc mid repo and Danish krone bid and ask repo rates also come
from Bloomberg. The Japanese repo rates come from the Bank of Japan and
the Japan Securities and Dealer Association. More details on the GC repo
markets in our sample countries can be found in the Internet Appendix.

Other Fixed Income Spreads: We compare the cross-currency basis with
four types of near-risk-free ﬁxed-income spreads. First, the KfW-German bund
basis is the spread of a ﬁve-year euro-denominated bond issued by KfW over
the ﬁve-year German bund yield. The ﬁve-year KfW bond yield is estimated
using the Nelson-Siegel methodology on individual KfW bond prices obtained
from Bloomberg.

Second, the one-month versus three-month Libor tenor swap basis measures
the premium that one party has to pay in order to receive the one-month
ﬂoating U.S. Libor in exchange for the three-month ﬂoating U.S. Libor for the
ﬁve-year duration of the contract. The tenor swap basis reﬂects a premium for
more frequent payments or a higher desirability of short-term liquidity. The
tenor swap basis data are downloaded from Bloomberg.

Third, the CDS-CDX basis measures the difference between the average
ﬁve-year CDS spreads on the 125 constituent names of the North America
investment grade CDS index (NA.IG.CDX) and the spread on the corresponding
aggregate NA.IG.CDX index. All data on CDS and CDX spreads are obtained
from Markit.

Fourth, the CDS-bond basis measures the difference between the asset swap
spread on a corporate bond over the CDS spread on the same reference entity.
We use the CDS-bond basis provided by Morgan Markets for investment-grade

bonds. Both the CDS-CDX basis and CDS-bond basis lead to popular credit
arbitrage strategies.
