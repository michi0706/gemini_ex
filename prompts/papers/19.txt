We study how the presence of short sellers affects the incentives of the insiders to trade
on negative information. We show it induces insiders to sell more (shares from their
existing stakes) and trade faster to preempt the potential competition from short sellers.
An experiment and instrumental variable analysis confirm this causal relationship. The
effects are stronger for “opportunistic” (i.e., more informed) insider trades and when short
sellers' attention is high. Return predictability of insider sales only occurs in stocks with
high short-selling potential, suggesting that short sellers indirectly enhance the speed of
information dissemination by accelerating trading by insiders.

Introduction

A large body of literature shows that insiders trade on
private information (e.g., Jaffe, 1974; Seyhun, 1986, 1998;
Lin and Howe, 1990; Rozeff and Zaman, 1998; Lakonishok
and Lee, 2001; Marin and Olivier, 2008; Jagolinzer, 2009;
Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky, 2012). Less attention, how-
ever, has been devoted to how the trading activity of other
types of “informed” investors affects insiders' trading

activity. Such research is important, as any interaction
with other players may accelerate the release of new
information by insiders and significantly affect the way
information propagates in the financial markets. In this
paper, we study this issue by exploring how the presence
of a particular type of informed investors—i.e., the short
sellers—could alter insiders' incentives to trade on their
private (negative) information.

It is well-documented that short sellers are able to
identify overvalued or “suspicious” stocks (e.g., Dechow,
Hutton, Meulbroek, and Sloan, 2001; Christophe, Ferri, and
Angel, 2004; Desai, Krishnamurthy, and Venkataraman,
2006; Cohen, Diether, and Malloy, 2007; Christophe, Ferri,
and Hsieh, 2010; Karpoff and Lou, 2010; Hirshleifer, Teoh,
and Yu, 2011; Ljungqvist and Qian, 2014). In addition, short
sellers intermediate a considerable amount of trade. Diether,
Lee, and Werner (2009a) document that the daily shorting
activity composes 24% of the NYSE and 31% of the Nasdaq
share volume. Collectively, these characteristics make short

sellers an important class of “informed” investors whose
trading activity may directly and significantly affect insiders.
We propose a channel through which short selling can
affect insiders: trading competition. More specifically, we
argue that the presence of short sellers changes the strategic
behavior of insiders by introducing potential competition in
private information trading. In the absence of short sellers,
insiders with access to information about a value-destroying
event not yet disclosed to the market will strategically sell
their shares before the information is known to the public
(e.g., Kyle, 1985). However, in the presence of short sellers,
insiders will fear that short sellers may obtain access to the
same information and therefore compete with them in
trading on the information. The presence (fear) of such
trading competition will accelerate the rate at which private
information is revealed to the market (e.g., Kyle, 1984;
Holden and Subrahmanyam, 1992; Foster and Viswanathan,
1993), drive down the price at which insiders can sell their
shares, and jeopardize the profitability of
insider sales.
Insiders, aware of such potential competition, will have
incentives to accelerate their information processing and
trading activities in order to preempt short sellers.1 To the
extent that corporate insiders, such as senior managers and
board directors, have access to superior corporate informa-
tion before the outsiders, such a preemptive strategy is both
feasible and optimal.

Such a preemptive strategy requires insiders to sell
more and faster, especially when potential short sellers
can compete effectively in trading on the same informa-
tion. As a result, the potential of effective short selling
should ex ante increase the scope and speed of insider
sales. By contrast, with no credible short-selling competi-
tion, insiders should sell at low volumes and over a long
period of time to reduce the price impact of their trades
(e.g., Kyle, 1985).

We apply this intuition to data focusing on US stocks over
the 2006–2011 period and document the ex ante impact of
short-selling potential on insider sales. We use lendable
shares—the fraction of shares available for borrowing (by
short sellers)—as a proxy for the potential severity of short
selling (hereinafter, short-selling potential). Lendable shares
reasonably capture the capacity of potential short-selling
competition,2 because it determines how many shares are

1 In general, insiders could observe corporate private information
earlier than other market participants. Nonetheless, the recent scandal
that SAC, a $14 billon hedge fund, had “engaged in insider trading on an
unprecedented scale” (Financial Times, July 25, 2013) reveals that some
short sellers may occasionally have access to private information compar-
able with that of insiders. Indeed, Khan and Lu (2013) document that
short sellers can even front-run insiders due to information leakage,
which would even further enhance the preemptive incentives for truly
informed insiders in our context. The same intuition applies to positive
private information. Indeed, short sellers, such as hedge funds, may also
compete with insiders in trading on positive private information. How-
ever, empirically identifying their long trading capacity is difficult.

2 If short sellers wish to trade on their negative views via options or
other derivatives markets, the feasibility and cost of such trades may still
be affected by the equity loan market via, for instance, market makers'
hedging behavior in the options and derivatives markets. Thus, the
impact of Lendable is not restricted to the equity market. A few recent
studies suggest that the amount of lendable shares could be a binding
short sale constraint (Beneish, Lee, and Nichols, 2013), which may give

available for borrowing (by short sellers), which directly
speaks to the feasibility of the shorting activity and thus the
maximum degree of trading competition that short sellers
can introduce. We define insiders as directors and officers (as
per Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky, 2012) and focus on their
trading decisions: how much to sell (as a percentage of their
existing stakes) and how fast to sell (i.e., the time span of
their trades).3

We present our analysis in three steps. In the first step,
we document that the occurrence (i.e., likelihood) of open
market sales by insiders is strongly positively associated with
the availability of lendable shares in the previous month. A
one-standard-deviation increase in lendable shares raises the
relative probability of insider sales by 10% when all insiders
are included and 14% when only directors and officers are
considered. When we differentiate, following Cohen, Malloy,
and Pomorsky (2012), insider sales that are motivated by
private information (i.e., opportunistic sales) from those that
are uninformative (i.e., routine sales), we find that the above
relationship is significant in the case of opportunistic insider
sales and becomes insignificant in the case of uninformative,
routine insider sales. These findings provide initial evidence
that insiders tend to trade more aggressively in the presence
of short sellers when their trading is motivated by private
information.

Next, in the second step, we focus on the modality of
insider sales. More specifically, we examine the amount
and time span of
insider trades. We document that,
conditional on their decision to participate in open market
sales, the amount that insiders sell as a fraction of their
existing stakes is significantly positively associated with
short-selling potential: a one-standard-deviation increase
in short-selling potential is associated with a 2.4% increase
in the portion of shares insiders sell out of their existing
stakes in general and a 3% increase in the case of
opportunistic sales in particular.
If we compare these
short-selling induced sales to the average portion of their
existing stakes that the insiders sell in a given transaction
(25% and 24% in the two cases), the economic impact is
sizable. By contrast, the time span of insider sales is
significantly reduced by the potential presence of short
selling. A one-standard-deviation increase in lendable
shares is associated with a 4.7% decrease in the number
of days of net sale transactions in a given month for all
insider sales and 12% fewer days for opportunistic sales.

(footnote continued)
rise to the important externality of discouraging information acquisition
(Nezafat and Wang, 2014).

3 The first variable follows the literature (e.g., Scott and Xu, 2004;
Jenter, 2005), while we construct the second variable as the maximum
selling span in a given month to capture our unique prediction regarding
the speed of trading. The literature also employs other variables to
represent insider trades. For instance, Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky
(2012) use the number of insider sale transactions in a month as the
main proxy for insider trades. Here, we follow Scott and Xu (2004) and
Jenter (2005) to scale the amount of insider sales using insiders' existing
holdings, primarily to be consistent with classical portfolio theories, in
which the main decision variable is the investment weight. Regarding the
speed of trading, subsequent sections provide an alternative measure
related to the duration of insider sales in a given month, and the main
results remain unchanged.

This suggests that insiders also speed up their trades to
potentially preempt short sellers.

In our third step, we provide a causal explanation of the
above results by exploiting an experiment:
the SHO
experiment. The Regulation SHO Pilot Program, announced
in 2004, randomly selected one-third of the stocks on the
Russell 3000 Index to be exempt from uptick rules and
other price restrictions. The relaxation of short-selling
restrictions induced an exogenous change in short-selling
cost
(e.g., Diether, Lee, and Werner, 2009b; Grullon,
Michenaud, and Weston, 2015). We thus exploit the
program announcement upon which there is an exogenous
shock to the perceived short-selling potential among pilot
stocks and study whether it is associated with a change in
insider sale activity. Using a difference-in-differences (diff-
in-diff) approach, we show that,
in line with our full
sample results, the announcement that the short-selling
restrictions were being lifted increased the propensity for
insider selling among the pilot firms relative to the firms in
the control group. Moreover, insiders in the pilot firms
sold more of their existing stakes and reduced the time
span of trading relative to the control group after the
announcement. We also rule out (change in) liquidity as an
alternative explanation for the observed change in insider
selling activity.

The SHO test establishes a causal relationship between
short-selling potential and insider trading behavior. To
provide additional evidence, we also exploit information
on exchange traded fund (ETF) ownership. ETFs are among
the main contributors to the equity lending market. Given
that ETFs are largely passive, non-information-driven
investors, ETF ownership represents an instrument for an
exogenous, non-informationally motivated supply shock in
the lending market, which is orthogonal to the informa-
tionally motivated trades of the insiders.
Instrumental
variable analysis further confirms the causal link from
short-selling potential to insider sale transactions.

In addition to these three main steps, we also provide a
list of additional tests to extend our economic intuition.
We first examine the cross-sectional dimension in greater
depth and investigate the situations in which the link
between short-selling potential and insider-selling beha-
vior is stronger—when short sellers' attention is higher.
We use the number of negative public news events
concerning the firm and the level of realized shorting
activity among industry peers to proxy for short sellers'
potential attention. We find that insiders sell more of their
ownership stake and do so more rapidly when both
lendable shares and short sellers' potential attention are
high. This result complements our main analyses in the
spirit of Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2007) that a proper
combination of supply-side (lendable) and demand-side
information (attention) generates the maximum impact of
potential short-selling competition.

We then explore the market implications of short
selling with respect to information dissemination. Specifi-
cally, we examine how short-selling potential affects the
return predictability of insider trading. We document that
the predictability of (opportunistic) insider sales is con-
centrated in stocks with high short-selling potential. In
other words, in the presence of short sellers, insiders are

more likely to sell when they have information of parti-
cularly high quality. By urging insiders to release new
negative information into the market, short selling indir-
ectly accelerates information dissemination for firms. This
finding confirms our initial intuition that the impact of
other types of informed traders on insiders will signifi-
cantly affect the general process of information dissemina-
tion in the market. Finally, we demonstrate that our main
results remain qualitatively unchanged when we conduct
robustness checks using a matching sample analysis and
alternative definitions of corporate insiders.

These results are important as they document that
“informed” professional investors (e.g., short sellers) improve
market efficiency not only by directly trading, but also (and
possibly more importantly) by speeding up the trades of the
insiders. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that
addresses such an important issue with a detailed empirical
analysis that links short-selling and sales by insiders. This
provides new insights for regulators and policy makers in
terms of the interaction between insider trading rules and
restrictions on short-selling activity.

More specifically, we contribute to several strands of
the literature. First, our paper is related to the literature on
insider trading, which primarily focuses on assessing the
informational content of insider trades and predicting
cross-sectional returns (Lorie and Niederhoffer, 1968;
Jaffe, 1974; Seyhun, 1986, 1998; Lin and Howe, 1990;
Damodaran and Liu, 1993; Bettis, Vickery, and Vickery,
1997; Rozeff and Zaman, 1998; Lakonishok and Lee, 2001;
Piotroski, and Roulstone, 2005; Marin and Olivier, 2008;
Jagolinzer, 2009). More recent studies also attempt to
identify information-driven insider trading based on the
characteristics of insider trades (Scott and Xu, 2004; Jenter,
2005; Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky, 2012), events upon
which insiders trade (e.g., Kahle, 2000; Ke, Huddart, and
Petron, 2003; Cheng and Lo, 2006; Huddart, Hughes,
Levine, Ke, and Shi, 2007), or counterparties involved in
trading, such as institutional and individual investors (Sias
and Whidbee, 2010). We contribute to this literature by
studying the effect of short-selling potential on insider
trading and its return predictability. The impact of short
selling on insider trading also conforms to the general
intuition advanced by Marin and Olivier (2008) that
insider purchases and sales may be driven by different
economic motivations.

Second, this paper is related to the literature on short
selling. A number of studies demonstrate that short sellers
possess superior information: they are able to identify over-
valued stocks (e.g., Desai, Ramesh, Thiagarajan, and Bala-
chandran, 2002; Cohen, Diether, and Malloy, 2007; Boehmer,
Jones, and Zhang, 2008; Diether, Lee, and Werner, 2009a;
Boehmer, Huszar, and Jordan, 2010) or are particularly good
at processing information (e.g., Engelberg, Reed, and
Ringgenberg, 2012). We extend this literature by revealing a
specific channel through which short sellers expedite informa-
tion discovery—by incentivizing insiders who have private
information to trade. In that respect, our results are also broadly
related to the literature on strategic trading with multiple
informed traders (e.g., Kyle, 1984; Holden and Subrahmanyam,
1992; Foster and Viswanathan, 1993; Edmans and Manso,
2011). We contribute to this literature by demonstrating that

M. Massa et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 118 (2015) 268–288

271

the presence of additional informed traders (i.e., short sellers)
largely affects the ex ante strategy and behavior of other
informed traders (i.e., corporate insiders).

Finally, we also contribute to the literature on the
informativeness of stock prices. Existing studies in this
literature focus on the institutional environment faced by
firms to explain the informativeness of stock prices (e.g.,
Morck, Yeung, and Yu, 2000; Jin and Myers, 2006). More-
over, although short selling is well recognized to increase
the efficiency of the market (e.g., Bris, Goetzmann, and
Zhu, 2007; Saffi and Sigurdsson, 2011), the channels
through which it achieves such efficiency are less
explored. One notable exception is Boehmer and Wu
(2013), which illustrates how information gets incorpo-
rated into stock price through short sellers'
intraday
trading. Our unique contribution is to propose and test
an explicit economic channel through which short selling
can (indirectly) improve the price efficiency of the econ-
omy. This indirect channel complements the direct chan-
nel of trading in affecting efficiency.

Overall, our results have important normative and
policy implications, illustrating that regulations aimed at
reducing short selling will also affect the informativeness
of the market by reducing insider selling. Therefore, the
subjects of different policies may need to be considered
jointly: policies that affect shorting are likely to also affect
insider trading. Moreover, our findings suggest that the
effect of short selling could have been largely under-
estimated to date, because regulators and academic
researchers have till now ignored its impact on prices
through insider trades that precede the shorting trades.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we present our stylized model and two pre-
liminary empirical patterns that are key motivations for
the model. In Section 3, we describe the data and the
construction of the main variables.
In Section 4, we
provide the main evidence.
In Section 5, we address
causality and endogeneity. Section 6 provides additional
tests and robustness checks. A brief conclusion follows.

2. Main hypotheses

To illustrate our main intuition, we sketch a simple
stylized model to lay out the relationship between insider
trading and short selling. We report
in
Appendix IA (in the online appendix). Here, we lay out
the main intuition.

the model

We consider a firm in which a manager may take a
private “bad action”, e.g., investing in projects with nega-
tive net present values, that could benefit him but damage
the shareholders. The market is aware of this but can only
guess whether the manager will take such an action. In
contrast, the insider can observe the action when it is
taken. This information asymmetry between the insider
and the public motivates the former to trade in the market
before the market is made aware of it.

Let us now consider the role of the short sellers. These
traders are also informed and can trade against managerial
misconduct (e.g., Senchack and Starks, 1993; Asquith,
Mikhail, and Au, 2005; Cohen, Diether, and Malloy, 2007;
Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang, 2008), but are on average

slower than the insiders. All informed traders are strategic
in the sense of Kyle (1984, 1985).

In this context, the presence of short-sellers acts as a
stimulus for the insiders to trade sooner and faster. The
intuition is similar to Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992)
with multiple informed traders. Based on the these
assumptions, the impacts of short selling on the incentives
for insider trading in Period 1 can be summarized in the
following proposition (Appendix IA in the online appendix
provides the proof).

Proposition 1. In the presence of short selling, the insider has
an incentive to sell her shares before the short seller attacks
the firm. The more shares that are available to short sellers,
the more shares the insider wants to sell before the short
sellers attack.

Proposition 1 contains two main intuitions. First, com-
petition from short sellers reduces the profitability of
insider trading if they wait. Indeed, when the insider is
the only (monopoly) informed trader in the second period,
his trading reveals half of his private information to the
market. If, however, one or more informed short sellers
compete with the insider in trading on the same piece of
private information, aggregate trading demand increases
relative to the case in which the insider is the only one to
have access to such information. In this situation, more
private information is revealed to the market. Conse-
quently, the market price becomes more informative—
but informed trading becomes less profitable with addi-
tional competitors trading in the market.

Appendix IA (in the online appendix) shows that the
total fraction of lendable shares imposes a natural capacity
constraint on the feasible degree of trading competition.
Specifically, the greater the number of shares available to
short sellers is, the higher the level of trading competition
is—i.e., a larger amount of lendable shares allows more
informed short sellers to potentially trade on the same
private information—and the greater the degree of price
efficiency is. This finding is in line with the widely
observed empirical evidence that lendable shares increase
price efficiency (Saffi and Sigurdsson, 2011). It also sug-
gests that for our empirical purposes, we can use the
fraction of lendable shares to proxy for the capacity for
potential trading competition that the short-selling market
may introduce. We will refer to it as short-selling potential.
Second, given that competition from short sellers
adversely affects insider trading, the insider has an incen-
tive to “preempt” short sellers by shifting his trades
toward the first period, i.e., to sell more shares from his
existing portfolio in the first period, before any short
selling occurs. If short-selling competition is sufficiently
severe, the insider should concentrate his trading in the
first period. This intuition provides us with the first
testable hypothesis regarding the impact of short-selling
potential on an insider's trading behavior.

If, instead, short-selling competition does not exist, the
insider's optimal strategy is to spread the trades over the
two periods. In this regard, short-selling potential also
shortens the effective time span for insider sales. Overall,
Proposition 1 predicts that the scale and time span of

272

M. Massa et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 118 (2015) 268–288

insider sales should be substantially affected by short-
selling competition (i.e., short-selling potential), which can
be formulated into the following two testable hypotheses:

H1. Short-selling potential increases the fraction of their
existing stakes that insiders want to sell.

H2. Short-selling potential reduces the average time span
of insider sales.

Before proceeding to test these predictions, we provide

some information on the data we use.

3. Data, variable construction, and preliminary evidence

We now describe the sources of our data, the construc-
tion of our main variables, and some preliminary evidence.

3.1. Data sample and sources

The sample covers the period between July 2006 and
November 2011. We begin with the publicly listed companies
in the US. traded on the NYSE, Nasdaq, or Amex exchanges
(we include only common shares and exclude non-US incor-
porated firms, or American depositary receipts (ADRs), ETF,
and Real estate investment trusts (REITs) from our main
sample,
i.e., when Center for Research in Security Prices
(CRSP) share code¼10 or 11). This sample is then matched
with short-selling information from Data Explorers, insider
data from Thomson Reuters, and data on institutional inves-
tors' stock holdings from Thomson 13F and analyst informa-
tion from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (I/B/E/S).
More specifically, we obtain equity lending data from
Data Explorers, a research company that collects equity and
bond lending data directly from the security lending desks
at the world's leading financial institutions. Information
detailed at the stock level is available from May 2002 to
November 2011. In particular, the data set has the unique
feature that it provides information on not only the value of
shares that are on loan but also the value of shares that are
available to be lent to short sellers, which is important for
the purpose of this paper. A more detailed description of
the data can be found in Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011) and
Jain, Jain, McInish, and McKenzie (2013). In our study, we
focus on the period beginning from July 2006, when Data
Explorer has a more thorough coverage of the equity
lending market in the US. Extension to earlier periods does
not alter our main results. We focus on the US. sample and
verify that short-selling information is available for approxi-
mately 84% of the firms in our sample period, which is
similar to the figure reported in Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011).
The data on insider trades are from Thomson Reuters
Insider Filings (Form 4). The data contain information on
each insider sale transaction and each insider's relationship
to the firm. We focus on insiders' open market sales, and we
exclude open market purchases and private transactions. For
the bulk of our analysis, we follow the literature (Ke,
Huddart, and Petron, 2003; Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky,
2012) and define insiders as directors and officers. As a
robustness check, we also consider an alternative definition
of insiders. Specifically, the insider database defines the chief
executive officer, chairman of the board, chief operating

officer, president, and general counsel as top level insiders
(as recorded in the insider database), whom we consider to
be the top five most powerful insiders in our analysis.

We follow Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky (2012) and
identify information-driven insider trades based on a “rou-
tine” and “opportunistic” classification.4 In our sample per-
iod, 42% of all insider sales are routine insider sales, and the
rest are opportunistic insider sales. Unreported tests follow-
ing their paper confirm that routine and opportunistic
insider sales serve as valid proxies for non-information-
and information-driven insider sales in our sample period.

We use CUSIP to combine Compustat/CRSP data with
the equity lending data and insider data. We also obtain
institutional holdings from the Thomson 13F database as
well as analyst and earnings announcement information
from I/B/E/S. Finally, penny stocks (priceo$1) and zero
turnover stocks are excluded from the sample. Book-to-
market, leverage, and sale variables are winsorized at the
99% and 1% levels. The final combined data have an
average of 4,168 stocks per month. Our final sample is
comparable to what has been reported in the literature.
For instance, Boehmer, Huszar, and Jordan (2010) report an
average of 4,400 stocks per month over the 1988–2005
period based on the three major stock exchanges.5

3.2. Main variables

The variable of interest is the amount of shares avail-
able for borrowing (Lendable) as a proportion of shares
outstanding. It measures the capacity and potential inten-
sity of short-selling activity. We focus on a series of
important variables related to the insider trading decision.
The first is InsiderSale_FracStake, the proxy for the fraction
or amount of shares sold from existing stakes. This variable
is defined as the number of open market sale shares of
officers and directors divided by their initial shares owned
in a given firm-month, where the initial shares owned is
computed as the number of shares held by the insiders at
the beginning of the month.6 The second variable is
InsiderSale_TimeSpan, the proxy for the speed of insider
sale transactions. This variable is defined as the number of
days that an insider takes to complete sale transactions in
a month—i.e., equal to n if the last net sale transaction
within a month for a given firm is on the nth day since the
first day with nonzero net sale transactions. We also study
the robustness of our results using an alternative measure

4 We require an insider to make at least one trade in each of the
three preceding years to define her as either a routine or an opportunistic
trader. Specifically, routine insiders are those who have traded in the
same month for at least the past three consecutive years, and opportu-
nistic insiders are everyone else. At the beginning of each year, the
insiders are categorized as either routine or opportunistic based on their
trading history for the past three years.

5 If we further look into the details of our final sample, an average of
1,361 stocks per month come from NYSE during the period of Jul 2006 to
Nov 2011, which is consistent with Boehmer and Wu (2013). The rest of
the stocks come from Nasdaq/Amex. Our main results are robust on the
subsample of stocks coming from different exchanges.

6 Following Scott and Xu (2004), we compute initial ownership using
the number of shares traded and insiders' shareholdings at the end of the
trades reported on the US. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
forms that insiders complete for their trades.

to capture the speediness of insider sale transactions. We
will discuss this alternative measure in detail in Section 6.
The third variable is Insider sell dummy. This variable is a
dummy equal to one if the officers and directors of a firm
have open market sales in the current month and zero
otherwise. Finally, we also construct a control variable to
capture the size of the insider trades: Total open market
shares sold/shares outstanding. This variable is defined as
the number of shares sold by officers and directors in a
given firm-month divided by the total number of shares
outstanding at the beginning of the month. All of these
variables are primarily defined to capture officers and
directors as corporate insiders.

The literature also suggests that certain firm character-
istics may affect the incentives for insider trades. For
instance, insiders trade more actively in large stocks, in
low book-to-market firms, and following positive past
returns (e.g., Lakonishok and Lee, 2001; Ke, Huddart, and
Petron, 2003; Rozeff and Zaman, 1998). We confirm and
control for these effects by explicitly employing a set of
control variables: Market size, defined as the market
capitalization of the firm; Book to market, defined as the
book value of equity divided by market capitalization;
Turnover, defined as the sum of monthly trading volumes
divided by shares outstanding; Lagged 6m ret, defined as
the cumulative stock return for the last six months; and
Leverage, defined as long-term debt issues plus current
liability divided by total assets. Sale is gross sales (in
millions), i.e., the amount of actual billings to customers
for regular sales completed during the period. Idiosyncratic
volatility is calculated as the monthly average of the
standard deviation of residuals from the adjusted Fama-
French daily regressions (Jiang, Xu, and Yao, 2009). IO is
institutional ownership, which is defined as institutional
ownership shares divided by adjusted shares outstanding.
ETF denotes the percentage of ETF ownership. Analyst
coverage is the number of analysts following the firm.
Price is the share price at the end of the month.7

We report the descriptive statistics in Table 1. Panel A
reports summary statistics of stock- and firm-level char-
acteristics, and Panel B reports pair-wise correlation sta-
tistics. The average firm in the sample has a market
capitalization of 3.40 billion USD, a book-to-market ratio
of 0.66, a monthly turnover rate of 0.14, and 47% institu-
tional ownership. Moreover, an average firm has 18% of its
total shares outstanding in the inventory available for
borrowing (Lendable), suggestive of an active equity lend-
ing market in the US. More importantly, the high standard
deviation in the lendable shares (12%) indicates a signifi-
cant amount of variation among firms across the years. In
particular, the bottom 5% of the observations in our sample
essentially have zero shares available for short sellers to

7 Ownership structure, e.g., block ownership or family ownership,
may be an important determinant of insider trading and simultaneously
may be correlated with short-selling potential (i.e., the number of shares
available for borrowing). We do not have such information for each firm
in our sample to control for the ownership effect. However, we perform a
robustness check by restricting the sample to the set of family-owned
firms (Anderson, Duru, and Reeb, 2009; Anderson, Reeb, and Zhao, 2012).
Our main analysis holds in the subsample of family-owned firms.

borrow, while the top 5% of the sample have more than
39% of their total shares outstanding available for borrow-
ing. This rich variation in the short-selling potential facil-
itates identification in our analysis.

In a given month, 21% of the firms have an open market
insider sale (by directors and officers), and 5% of the firms
have an opportunistic open market insider sale (by officers
and directors). If we condition on selling, we observe that
insiders sell an amount equal to 24.85% of their portfolio.
On average, an insider completes his sale transactions in
7.79 days within a given month, conditional on observing
an open market insider sale. Overall, the primary char-
acteristics of firms and the distributions of insider trades
are largely consistent with the insider trading literature
(e.g., Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky, 2012).

The pair-wise correlation statistics reveal a positive
relationship between Lendable and Insider sale (and Oppor-
tunistic insider sale). Insider sale is also positively correlated
with Market size, Turnover, Past return, Idiosyncratic volati-
lity, Institutional ownership, and Analyst coverage but nega-
tively correlated with Book to market. Consistent with the
statistics in Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011), Lendable is posi-
tively correlated with Market size and Turnover and nega-
tively correlated with Book to market.

4. Effect of short-selling potential on insider sales

We analyze insiders' trading incentives. We first ana-
lyze how short-selling potential affects the incentive for
insiders to participate in open market sales and then
extend the analysis to analyze the two decision variables.

4.1.

Insider sales and short-selling potential

We begin with a conditional

logit analysis of how
short-selling potential affects the incentive for insiders to
participate. The dependent variable is the occurrence of
insider sales (i.e., Insider sell dummy) for a firm in a given
month. We consider two alternative definitions of insider
sales: (1) only the sales by the officers and directors (our
main measure of insiders), and (2) the sales conducted by
all insiders as recorded in Form 4 of the Insider Filings (to
study whether the result is generalizable). The main
explanatory variable is the one-month lagged Lendable.
All control variables are also lagged by one month. This
time convention allows us to detect how short-selling
potential affects corporate insiders' decisions to sell their
existing shares in the near future. We include firm and
year-month fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at
the firm level.

We report the results in Table 2. Columns 1 and 4 show
that greater short-selling potential–i.e., the existence of a
higher amount of lendable shares that short sellers can
potentially use—strongly drives insiders to sell their shares
in the near future. The regression coefficients of lendable
shares are 0.84 when all insiders are included and 1.17
when only directors and officers are considered. These
numbers are not only statistically significant but also
economically relevant: a one-standard-deviation increase
in lendable shares (12%) increases the relative probability
of insider sales by 10.1% and 14%, respectively, in these two

Conditional logit regression of insider sales.

This table presents the results of a conditional logit regression analysis for insider sales using monthly observations between 2006:07 and 2011:11. The
dependent variables are dummy variables for various types of insider sales for a firm in a given month. Please refer to Appendix A for the variable
definitions. All independent variables are lagged by one month. Firm and year-month fixed effects are included in all tests, and standard errors are
clustered at the firm level. We report t-statistics in the parentheses below coefficient estimates, and statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is
indicated by nnn, nn and n, respectively.

cases.8 Moreover, both effects are statistically significant at
the 1% level. The economic and the statistical significance
are higher for sales from directors and officers. These
results are in line with our information-driven argument,
as these insiders presumably have access to better private
information and more informationally motivated sales. In
addition to our main variables, the regression coefficients
on our control variables, such as Market size, Book to
market, and Lagged 6m ret, are consistent with the litera-
ture (e.g., Lakonishok and Lee, 2001; Ke, Huddart, and
Petron, 2003; Rozeff and Zaman, 1998).

If we further divide insider sales into routine and
opportunistic sales, we observe that the impact of Lendable
concentrates in opportunistic sales (columns 2, 3 and 5, 6).
Specifically, a one-standard-deviation increase in lendable

8 The probability that insider trading occurs is π xð Þ ¼ ð1=ð1þe  βx ÞÞ
in the logit regression, where x is the independent variable and β is the
regression parameter. Since high order terms of π can be omitted (the
average unconditional insider trading probability is 0:21 in our whole
sample, making the π2 term as small as 4%), an increase in the
independent variable, Δx, affects π as follows: Δ ln πð Þ  ðΔπ=πÞ ¼ βΔx,
where Δπ=π represents the relative increase in the probability. For
instance, a one-standard-deviation increase in lendable shares increases
the relative probability of insider trading by 10% (i.e., 12%  0:84) and
14% (i.e., 12%  1:17) for all
insiders and for directors and officers,
respectively.

shares increases the likelihood that opportunistic insider
sales will occur by 14.8% when all insiders are included
and 17.2% when only directors and officers are considered.
Overall, these results support our first hypothesis that a
greater amount of lendable shares increases the insiders'
incentives to sell, particularly for the information-related
insider sales.
In other words, the more informed the
insider is, the more they wish to preempt short sellers to
exploit their informational advantage. Since the results are
very similar across the two different definitions of insiders,
we will follow the literature and focus on officers and
directors as our insiders for the rest of the analysis.

4.2. Amount and speed of insider sales and short-selling
potential

Next, we examine the impact of short selling on the two
main decision variables for insider trading: the amount to
be sold from her existing stakes (InsiderSale_FracStake) and
the speed of transactions (InsiderSale_TimeSpan). We per-
form a Heckman two-stage procedure. We model the
decision to sell in the first stage and the choice of the
quantity to sell and the speed of transactions in the second
stage. Given the previous results, we focus on the open
market sales made by officers and directors.

Table 3
Heckman regression of open market insider sales.

This table presents the results of a regression analysis concerning the amount of open market sales by officers and directors using Heckman's two-stage
procedure with monthly observations between 2006:07 and 2011:11. The dependent variable in Panel A is InsiderSale_FracStake, and the dependent
variable in Panel B is the natural log of InsiderSale_TimeSpan, which is the maximum number of days that the insider takes to make his sales in a month. For
each panel, we study all open market transactions in columns 1–2 and focus on open market transactions in columns 3–4 (the control variable Total open
market shares sold/shares outstanding refers to all open market sales in columns 1–2 of Panel B and refers to opportunistic open market sales in columns 3–
4 of Panel B). In each specification, the first-stage (selection) equation studies the determinants of insider sales and includes an additional variable, Routine
sell dummy (equal to one if there is a routine open market sale by officers and directors in the same month), as the identifying restriction. The second-stage
regression uses estimates of the inverse Mills' ratio from the first-stage regression to control for selection bias. Specifically, we estimate the following
equations:

1st Stage:

Insider sell dummyi;t ¼ αþβ  Routine insider sell dummyi;t þγ  Xi;t   1 þϵi;t ;

InsiderSale_FracStakei;t ¼ aþb  λi;t þc  Xi;t   1 þei;t   1;

or

where Xi;t   1 stacks the list of control variables and λi;t refers to the inverse Mills' ratio estimated from the first-stage regression. Refer to Appendix A for
variable definitions. Year-month fixed effects are included in all tests. We report t-statistics in the parentheses below coefficient estimates, and 1%, 5%, and
10% statistical significance are indicated with ***, ** and *, respectively.

In the first stage, as the identifying restriction, we
employ a dummy variable equal to one if there is a routine
open market sale by officers and directors in the same
month and zero otherwise (Routine insider sell dummy).
The intuition is that, as routine sales are unrelated to
private information (Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky, 2012)
and thus short selling (Table 2), they help to hide informed
trading. Indeed, in the same spirit that informed traders
only wish to trade when other noisy trading flows are
present to hide their information (e.g., Kyle, 1985), we
expect informed insiders to be more likely to participate in
open market sales when there are concurrent liquidity-
driven (or other non-informationally related) routine
transactions. Consistent with our model, such transactions
may help to camouflage information-driven trades. There-
fore, the occurrence of routine insider sales will increase
the incentives—and thus the observed probability—for
informed insiders to participate in trading. It does not,
however, directly affect the informed insiders' two deci-
sion variables, as these decisions should be affected by the
content of private information, which is not correlated
with the occurrence dummy of routine insider sales. This
result implies that the Routine insider sell dummy satisfies
both the inclusion and the exclusion requirements of
Heckman (1979).

Then, in the second stage, we regress the informed
insiders' two decision variables on Lendable, the previously
defined set of control variables, and the inverse Mills' ratio
from the first stage to correct for selection bias. Year-
month fixed effects are included, and standard errors are
clustered at the firm level. The overall regression model is
summarized by the following equations:
Insider sell dummyi;t ¼ αþβ

1st Stage:

Routine insider sell dummyi;t þγ  Xi;t   1þϵi;t;

2nd Stage:

or

LogðInsiderSale_TimeSpani;tÞ ¼ aþb  λi;t

þc  Xi;t   1 þei;t   1;

where Xi;t   1 indexes the list of independent and control
variables (all lagged by one month) and λi;t refers to the
inverse Mills' ratio estimated from the first-stage regression.
We report the results in Table 3. Panel A focuses on
InsiderSale_FracStake as the main dependent variable in the
second stage (column 1 for InsiderSale_FracStake and col-
umn 3 for Opportunistic InsiderSale_FracStake). The remain-
ing two columns report the estimates of the first-stage
selection equation (column 2 for Insider sell dummy; and
column 4 for Opportunistic insider sell dummy).

We first note that the occurrence of routine insider
sales significantly incentivizes overall and opportunistic
insider sales, which supports our choice of the Routine
insider sell dummy as the identifying instrument. More-
over, the second-stage regressions confirm that short-
selling potential can substantially increase the amount of
shares that are sold from insiders' existing holdings.
The effect is statistically significant and economically
relevant. Column 1 reports that a one-standard-deviation
increase in Lendable leads insiders to sell an additional
2.4% of their existing stakes,9 which amounts to nearly 10%
of the average insider sale size of 24.85% in our sample.
The economic effect is more substantial if we focus on
opportunistic open market sales (column 3), with a one-
standard-deviation increase in Lendable leading insiders to
sell an additional 3% of their existing stakes. This effect,

9 The impact of the linear regression model, y ¼ β  x, is estimated as
Δy ¼ β  Δx, where Δx denotes the one-standard-deviation change of
the independent variable, which amounts to 0:202  12% ¼ 2:4%.

278

M. Massa et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 118 (2015) 268–288

again, is sizable compared with the average opportunistic
insider sale size of 24.18%. Taken together, these results are
consistent with our second hypothesis that the presence of
short sellers induces insiders to sell more.

The next question concerns how rapidly insiders exe-
cute their transactions. We therefore replace the decision
variable of
InsiderSale_FracStake in the second-stage
regression with the log of InsiderSale_TimeSpan, our proxy
for transaction speed. The econometric specifications and
the set of control variables are the same as before.

The results are reported in Panel B with a layout similar
to that of Panel A. Unlike the previous case, here, short-
selling potential greatly reduces the time span of the
transactions in the second stage. A one-standard-deviation
increase in Lendable is associated with a 4.7% (or 12.2%)
decrease in the average time span of insider (or opportunistic
insider) transactions.10 This result is consistent with our third
hypothesis that insiders expedite their transactions in the
presence of short sellers, resulting in a smaller time span to
complete their transaction sequences.

5. Endogeneity checks

The previous results, while supportive of our hypotheses,
may still be subject to endogeneity concerns. In this section,
we address this issue using a multipronged approach. First, we
consider an experiment—the Reg SHO Pilot Program—to
identify the causal impact of short-selling potential on insider
sales. As an additional test, we perform an instrumental
variable analysis.

5.1. A quasi-experiment: the SHO Pilot Program

We now consider an exogenous change in short-selling
cost using the announcement of the change in short-sale
restrictions under Regulation SHO in 2004 as a natural
experiment. In the US. experiment, the SEC drafted and
established a pilot program exempting a third of the stocks
in the Russell 3000 Index from uptick rules and other price
restrictions (Diether, Lee, and Werner, 2009b; Grullon,
Michenaud, and Weston, 2015). The selection of stocks was
purely random. As described in SEC Release No. 50104, the
regulator “sorted the securities into three groups—Amex,
Nasdaq-NM, and NYSE—and ranked the securities in each
group by average daily dollar volume over the one year prior
to the issuance of this order from highest to lowest for the
period. In each group, we then selected every third stock from
the remaining stocks.”11 In doing so, the SEC effectively
generated a randomized experiment that exogenously reduces
short-selling restrictions for a subset of stocks.

For our purposes, the relaxation of the short-selling
restrictions also causes an exogenous change in the short-
selling potential perceived by insiders, which will, in turn,
change insiders'
incentive to sell, which leads to our

identification strategy. We use a diff-in-diff methodology,
using the Reg SHO Pilot Program as the natural experiment
to identify the causal effect of an exogenous change in the
short-selling potential on insider sales. Treatment firms are
the Pilot sample firms, and control firms are the remaining
Russell 3000 firms. The program was announced in Septem-
ber 2004 and implemented in January 2005. We study the
three months pre (2004.04–2004.06) and post (2004.09–
2004.11) the announcement of the Reg SHO Pilot sample.12
We consider the announcement window, instead of the
implementation window, to capture the effect of (ex ante)
short-selling potential as opposed to that of realized shorting
activity. The reasons are two-fold. First, the selection of the
testing period is motivated by our general intuition that
insiders with superior information will not wait until the
period in which short-selling competition increases (i.e., the
implementation window for Pilot firms). Rather, they will act
before the enforcement period and strategically sell more
and faster in the announcement period. By contrast, for
stocks that are not included in the Pilot pool, the incentives
for insiders to sell more and faster in the announcement
period are significantly weakened. In this regard, the identi-
fication power on the ex ante impact of enhanced short
selling is greatest during the announcement period. Second,
unlike the case in which market quality and liquidity change
once the program is implemented (Diether, Lee, and Werner,
2009b), we will demonstrate that liquidity does not change
during our testing period. Hence, focusing on the announce-
ment period allows us to isolate the short-selling effect from
other confounding effects, for example, due to liquidity.13

We perform the standard difference-in-differences regres-
sions in this analysis. Since we include both the firm and time
fixed effects, the coefficient on Pilot Post captures the treat-
ment group's (Pilot firms') post-program change relative to
that in the control group (i.e., diff-in-diff estimate). We present
the results in Table 4.

We find that lifting the short-selling restrictions increased
the likelihood of insider trading among treatment firms. On
average, Pilot stocks experience 2.9% greater likelihood of
insider sales for the Pilot firms relative to the control firms,
and the diff-in-diff coefficient is statistically significant at 5%
(Model 1). In addition, insiders in Pilot firms on average sell a
larger fraction of their stakes and reduce the time span of
their transactions (Model 2). Interestingly, insiders in Pilot
firms do not speed up their trades immediately after the
announcement of the regulation, presumably because there
is still plenty of time for them to sell stocks before short-
selling potential is really enhanced—hence, the necessity of
selling fast is greatly reduced. Overall, the results suggest
that the Reg SHO program has a causal effect on insiders'
incentives especially to trade more.

Next, we perform the following placebo test. Liquidity
may change in the treatment firms following the announce-
ment of the SHO Pilot Program, partly because of firms'

10 The relative impact for the time-span regression, lnðTÞ ¼ β  x, is
estimated as Δ ln Tð Þ ¼ ΔT=T ¼ β  Δx. Hence, the effects of a one-
standard-deviation increase are 0:394  12% ¼ 4:7% and 1:019 
12% ¼ 12:2% for the two cases.

htm.

12 We exclude 2004.07 and 2004.08, when the final Pilot sample was
being discussed but was not finalized (i.e., a period with uncertainty
about the program).

13 As a further robustness check, we extend the post-announcement
window to nine months after announcement (i.e., until 2005.05). The
results are qualitatively the same.

anticipation of reduced shorting costs and higher shorting
potential afterward. To address the concern that the change
in insiders' trading during the announcement period is
affected by the change in the general liquidity conditions of
the treatment firms, we study the difference in the monthly
turnover in the treatment group in the announcement
period relative to the difference in turnover among the
control firms (column 4 of Table 4). We find little change
in monthly turnover during the announcement period for
treatment firms. More importantly, the difference in the
change in turnover between the treatment and the control
groups is essentially zero both economically and statistically.
Finally, although the SHO experiment does not explicitly
rely on lendable shares,
it is nonetheless interesting to
investigate whether the regulation has also increased the
number of lendable shares on Pilot firms. If Regulation SHO
is expected to make short selling easier and thus more
important among all trades (e.g., Diether, Lee, and Werner,
2009b), more lendable shares could be supplied to the
market to meet such changes. We find evidence to support
this conjecture. More specifically, we conduct a diff-in-diff
analysis using 2005:05–2007:07 as the post-period and
2004:01–2005:04 as the pre-regulation period, and find a
modest yet statistically significant increase (0.4%) in the
lendable shares among Pilot firms relative to the change in
lendable shares among the control firms after the imple-
mentation of the REG SHO Pilot Program.14 Taken together,
the findings of our analysis and the previous literature
collectively support the identifying strategy of using the
REG SHO Pilot Program as an exogenous shock that rein-
forces short-selling potential.

Overall, our results confirm the identifying assumption
that the treatment and control firms are comparable both

14 The two periods are selected because Regulation SHO was imple-
mented in May 2005, and ended in August 2007. Note that we do not go
before 2004 because of the poorer coverage of Data Explorer in the
earlier period. Furthermore, the post-period here differs from that of our
insider trading test because, different from the incentives of insiders to
preempt short sellers, lenders benefit from enhanced short selling.

before and after the announcement of the Pilot Program.
Therefore, the significant increase in insider selling after
the announcement of the Pilot Program observed for the
treatment firms is due to the expected increase in short-
selling potential.

5.2. An instrumental variable approach

We complement the previous approach with an instru-
mental variable analysis. We re-estimate the previous
specifications (as estimated in Table 3) using ETF owner-
ship as the instrument for the variable Lendable. The use of
ETF ownership as an instrument provides an additional
identification to allay concerns that
the relationship
between lendable shares and insider trading is driven by
omitted variables rather than by the effect of short selling.
On the one hand, ETFs are among the main participants
in the short-selling market, making shares available that
can then be used by short sellers. On the other hand, ETFs,
being passive investors, do not typically engage in the
active control or informed trading of firms. Thus, the
fraction of shares held by ETFs is a good instrument, as it
meets both the exclusion restriction (i.e., there is no reason
it should be related to insider trading through any channel
other than the availability of shares to be lent in the short-
selling market) and the inclusion restriction (i.e., ETFs
make shares available to short sellers).

Moreover, the exogenous and high growth rate of the
ETF industry over the past decade suggests that the
instrument is likely to be very powerful. Indeed, unre-
ported results show that Lendable is strongly positively
related to the fraction of ETF ownership when we regress it
on ETF ownership, firm-level control variables, and firm
and year-month fixed effects. The effect of ETF ownership
not only is statistically significant at the 1% level but also
can explain approximately 50% of the variation in lendable
shares in our sample, providing strong evidence against a
weak instrument critique (Staiger and Stock, 1997). Over-
all, these results suggest that ETF ownership is a good
instrument for short-selling potential.

280

M. Massa et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 118 (2015) 268–288

We repeat the analysis in Table 3 using the instrumen-
ted Lendable. The results are reported in Table 5. Columns
1 and 2 report the impact of the instrumented Lendable on
the two-stage Heckman regressions related to the first
major decision variable for insider sales (InsiderSale_Frac-
Stake), while columns 3 and 4 conduct similar analyses for
the second major decision variable (Log(InsiderSale_Time-
Span)). The results confirm the previous findings in
Table 3; short-selling potential significantly incentivizes
insiders to sell more of their existing holdings and expe-
dite their sale transactions. Every 1% increase in (instru-
mented) Lendable is associated with a 0.46% increase in
shares sold as a proportion of insiders' existing portfolio
holdings and a 2.59% decrease in the time span of
transactions. Unreported results confirm that these effects
are primarily observed (and become stronger) in the
opportunistic sales sample.

Of course, ETF ownership may be related to uncontrolled-
for firm-specific characteristics, such as investor attention
and liquidity. The economic concern is that high investor
attention and liquidity may directly increase the price
efficiency of firms, which effectively disciplines managers
following the spirit of the previous model. Therefore, in a
robustness check, we orthogonalize ETF ownership on insti-
tutional ownership, the number of analysts following the
firm, and turnover. Unreported results using this orthogona-
lized variable provide similar results.

It may be argued that ETF affects insider trading
through not only the short-selling channel—such that the
instrumental test captures only a spurious correlation due
to omitted variables or the direct impact of the ETF itself—
but also another channel that we cannot explicitly control
for; then, such an impact should be observed independent
of the level of short-selling potential. By contrast, a lack of
direct explanatory power of ETF on insider trading in the
case of low short-selling potential would help to eliminate
the omitted variable problem. To address this issue, we
examine the impact of ETF ownership (ETF) on insider
trading when short selling is constrained. Unreported
results show that for these stocks (that have no short
interest in our sample period), ETF is clearly uncorrelated
with insider selling. Finally, we also find that Lendable
affects insider trading to an even greater extent when ETF
ownership is zero. Overall, these findings confirm the
quality of our instrument, making the instrumental vari-
able analysis a good complement to the test based on the
SHO experiment.

6. Extensions

On average, the previous results establish that an
insider is more likely to sell a higher proportion of her
ownership stake and do so more rapidly when the firm's
short-selling potential is higher. This section provides a list
of additional tests to extend our economic intuition and
assess the robustness of our main results. We first test
whether a firm's short-selling potential has a greater effect
on insiders'
incentives when short sellers' attention is
higher. We then explore the implications of our hypothesis
in terms of information dissemination. Finally, we provide

robustness checks using a matching sample analysis and
alternative definitions of insiders.

6.1. Short sellers' attention

While, as hypothesized, short-selling potential in gen-
eral affects insider sales, its impact could be more promi-
nent when competition over trading on private information
is more imminent, for instance, when the attention level of
short sellers is high. In this section, we exploit firm-specific
negative news events to test this additional implication. The
benefit of using news events is that we can use media
reports, or public attention, to proxy for the attention of
short sellers. For instance, news reports may cause short
sellers to pay particular attention to certain firms. Alterna-
tively, both short sellers and the public media pay attention
to the same firm when it has negative news (but short
sellers' private information is more accurate than the public
information available in the media). In either case, media
coverage correlates with short sellers' attention, and we
expect insiders to sell more and sell more rapidly shortly
before unfavorable media coverage.15

Specifically, we focus on how (the expected) short sellers'
attention affects insider selling through lendable shares by
relating insider trading to the interaction between attention
and Lendable. If high short-selling attention intensifies the
competitiveness of private information trading through the
improved use of existing lendable shares, we expect the
interaction to induce insiders to sell more and do so more
rapidly right before the attention events. We therefore collect
information on news events from RavenPack News Analytics,
which is a data provider (generally to hedge funds) with
explanatory and predictive input derived from (public) news.
For the purposes of our analysis, we focus on negative news.16
We compute the number of negative news articles for a firm
in one month, from which we subtract the average number of
negative news for the same firm in the preceding three
months. We define D_neg news as a dummy variable equal
to one if the number of negative news events (in excess of the
level in the previous three months) of the firm in a month is
above the cross-section median for that given month. We use
“D_neg news” in month tþ1 to proxy for the expected
abnormal short seller attention in month t. Then, we interact
D_neg news in month tþ1 with lagged Lendable and deter-
mine whether insiders sell in a different manner in month t
conditioning on attention. The dependent variables are Insi-
derSale_FracStake and InsiderSale_TimeSpan. We use the

(e.g., Engelberg, Reed, and Ringgenberg, 2012; Boehmer,
Zhang, 2012).

16 RavenPack extracts information from public news sources for tens
of thousands of firms, decodes the tone of reports based on linguistic
analyses, and assigns positive or negative values to the tone of news
reports on a 100-point scale (the lower the score is, the more negative
the coverage of the firm is), which the database calls the “sentiment
score” of news. We compute the monthly “sentiment score” of a firm by
averaging the scores over all news reported for the firm in a given month.
We then define the abnormal sentiment score as the difference between
the sentiment score in the current month and the average monthly
sentiment score over the previous three months for each firm. Our
negative news variable reflects news reports with negative abnormal
sentiment scores.

Heckman two-step procedure estimation method and include
the same set of control variables as in Table 3.

We report the results in Table 6. First, the amount of
lendable shares still significantly affects insider selling, as
before. The regression coefficients, 0.186 for InsiderSale_Frac-
Stake (column 1) and  0.282 for InsiderSale_TimeSpan (col-
umn 3), are also comparable with those reported in Table 3.
These results indicate that, irrespective of whether attention is
taken into consideration, the first-order impact of short-selling
potential is to incentivize insiders to sell more and faster.

More interestingly, we observe that high levels of attention
largely reinforce the general impact of short selling through
the interaction term—the regression parameters are 0.06 and
 0.266 for the size and time span of insider sales, respectively,
which are in the same direction as the regression coefficients
for Lendable. Conditional on the same level of lendable shares,
firms that would have more negative news in the subsequent
month are associated with more (by 6%, column 1) and faster
insider selling (by 26.6%, column 3). The magnitudes are highly
statistically and economically significant.

Overall, the analyses of short sellers' attention comple-
ment our main analyses in the spirit of Cohen, Diether, and
Malloy (2007): while Lendable measures the maximum
threat of short-selling competition from the supply side of
the short-selling market, attention describes its effective-
ness from the demand side of the market. The combina-
tion of the two produces the maximum impact of the
short-selling market on insider sales.

Implications for information dissemination

We now explore the implications of short selling by
the return predictability of

examining how it affects
insider sales.

We partition our sample according to a firm's average level
of lendable shares during the sample period. Firms with
average values of Lendable greater than the median are placed
in the High lendable (or high short-selling potential) sub-
sample, and the rest of the firms are placed in the Low
lendable subsample. The dependent variable is the monthly

Table 6
Insider selling before negative news events.

This table reports results regarding the effect of short seller potential on insider-selling behavior one month before negative news events using Heckman two-step
procedures (with the same specification and explanatory variables as in Table 3). We collect information on news events from RavenPack News Analytics, which is a
data provider (primarily to hedge funds) with sources of explanatory and predictive inputs derived from (public) news. RavenPack extracts information from public
news sources on tens of thousands of firms and codes its content as positive or negative on a 100-point scale (the lower the score is, the more negative the
information regarding the firm is). For the purposes of our analysis, we focus on the negative news events (in the form of news events with negative abnormal
sentiment scores). We then compute the number of the negative news events on a firm in a given month, defined as (the logarithm of) the number of negative news
events minus (the logarithm of) the number of the negative news events over the previous three months). D_neg news is equal to one if the number of negative news
for a firm in a month is above median in the cross-section of firms at that given month. Please refer to Appendix A for the variable definitions. We report results
regarding insider-selling behavior one month before the negative news event using the Heckman two-step procedures in the 2006:07–2011:11 period. In addition to
the reported variables, we include the same set of control variables as in Table 3. We report t-statistics in the parentheses below the coefficient estimates, and
statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is indicated by nnn, nn, and n, respectively.

return (in percentage terms) over t, and the key independent
variables are the dummy variables for Insider sell, Opportunistic
insider sell, and Routine insider sell in month t 1. Following
Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky (2012), we include Market size
and Book to market in month t 1, the past one month's
returns (t 1), and past 12 months' returns (t 2,t 12), as
well as month fixed effects in the regression. Similarly,
standard errors are clustered at the firm level.

We report the results in Table 7. The first two columns
confirm that insider sales predict negative stock returns and
that this predictive power concentrates in opportunistic sales.
This result is generally consistent with Cohen, Malloy, and
Pomorsky (2012). The next two columns indicate that the
predictive power is greatest among stocks with high lendable
shares. These results identify an explicit channel through which
short sellers indirectly enhance the speed of
information
dissemination through their impact on insiders. That is, short-
selling potential incentivizes insiders to release more private
information into the market. Negative information is subse-
quently incorporated into stock prices. The literature (e.g., Bris,
Goetzmann, and Zhu, 2007; Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang, 2008;
Boehmer and Wu 2013; Saffi and Sigurdsson, 2011) argues that
short selling contributes to the market's informational efficiency
—and our analyses confirm the existence of an explicit economic
channel through which this contribution can be achieved.

6.3. Alternative interpretations

It is worth mentioning that the analysis till now has been
based on lendable shares and insider shares standardized by

shares outstanding. While the standardization follows the
literature convention (e.g., Saffi and Sigurdsson, 2011), we
consider an alternative way of standardizing our main vari-
ables based on trading volume. Our goal is twofold. The first is
purely methodological, as the alternative standardization
helps us to assess the robustness of our results. The second
is more conceptual, as it helps to differentiate our hypothesis
from an alternative information interpretation. Indeed, if both
insiders and short sellers scale their orders proportionally to
expected trading volume to minimize costs, which can
happen in Kyle (1984) types of models (including Holden
and Subrahmanyam (1992) as well as the model we presented
in the Internet Appendix) especially when uninformed trading
volume is time varying, stock lenders may also scale up their
lending volume accordingly. In this case, the positive relation-
ship between insider sales and lendable shares may reflect
“comovement” induced by the impact of trading volume on
informed trading, rather than insiders' preemptive trading
due to the fear of trading competition. The standardization
based on trading volume removes the potential impact of
trading volume on informed trading strategies. If standardized
lendable shares can still speed up similarly standardized
insider selling, the former proxy clearly captures the impor-
tance of short-selling potential with respect to all trading
volume rather than a comovement effect.

We therefore repeat the main analysis of Tables 2 and 3
based on trading volume-standardized insider sales and lend-
able shares. More specifically, we scale both variables by the
contemporaneous monthly trading volume of the stock—the
time convention here captures the idea that informed traders

Table 7
Return predictability of insider sales by short-selling potential.

This table reports results regarding the return predictability of insider sales between firms with high short-selling potential and firms with low short-
selling potential. We partition our sample according to the average level of lendable shares for a firm over the sample period. Firms with an average value
of Lendable greater than the median are placed in the High lendable (or high short-selling potential) subsample, and the rest of the firms are placed in the
Low lendable subsample. The dependent variable is the monthly return (in percentage terms) in t, and the key independent variables are dummy variables
for Insider sell, Opportunistic insider sell, and Routine insider sell in month t 1. Following Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorsky (2012), we include Market size and
Book to market in month t 1, past one month's returns (t 1), and past 12 months' returns (t 2, t 12) as well as month fixed effects in the regression.

may increase their trading when they expect a high unin-
formed trading volume to occur. Next, we also take the natural
logarithm of these standardized variables to alleviate the
outlier effect. We then apply the tests documented in
Tables 2 and 3 to these variables. In the interest of brevity,
we only describe the general patterns here while tabulating
the table in the Internet Appendix (Table IA.1)—all results are
very similar to what we have seen in Tables 2 and 3. More
explicitly, standardized lendable shares significantly increase
the likelihood for insider sales in general and opportunistic
open market sales in particular to occur. Furthermore, trading
volume-standardized lendable shares are positively associated
with insider sales and negatively associated with the time span
of insider sales, where insider sales are also standardized by
trading volume. All these effects are statistically significant,
suggesting that lendable shares in this case nonetheless
capture short-selling potential with respect to all trading
volume rather than comovements induced by time-varying
uninformed trading. These additional results, therefore, further
support our main interpretation based on trading competition.

6.4. Robustness checks

We first provide additional evidence that high values in
lendable shares introduce more trading competition to insiders
using an alternative specification of the short-selling potential
variable. Specifically, we construct two dummy variables D_low
lendable and D_high lendable, instead of using the continuous
variable of lendable shares. D_low lendable is a dummy equal to
one if the firm's lendable shares in a month is below the
bottom quartile of the cross-sectional distribution for that given

month. Likewise, D_high lendable is a dummy equal to one if
the firm's amount of lendable shares in a month is above the
top quartile of the monthly cross-sectional distribution. D_low
lendable identifies firms in months where (effective) short
selling is close to infeasible as the amount of lendable shares
in the inventory accounts for less than 7% of the total shares
outstanding (Table 1). These are the firms where we expect the
minimum impact on insiders' trading incentive from potential
short sellers. On the other hand, D_high lendable identifies firms
in months with abundant lendable shares and hence, insiders
face more credible threat by short sellers. We repeat the
analysis in Tables 2 and 3 and report the results in Table 8.

Panel A of Table 8 tabulates the results when we regress the
likelihood of insider selling on the two dummy variables
described above. The test is similar to that reported in
Table 2, except that we use the two dummy variables concern-
ing the extreme values of lendable shares rather than the
variable of lendable shares itself. Panel B further explores the
impact of the two dummy variables in the Heckman specifica-
tion following Table 3. From Panel A, we see that firms in the
top quartile of the distribution of lendable shares experience a
greater likelihood of their insiders selling and the effects are
statistically and economically significant. Panel B further
demonstrates that, conditional on the participation of sales,
insiders sell more and faster in the case of firms with extremely
high values of lendable shares (D_high lendable¼1) as com-
pared to firms with mid-range lendable shares. Likewise,
insiders sell less and slower in the case of firms with the low
levels of lendable shares (D_low lendable¼1) compared to
firms with mid-range lendable shares. F-tests also confirm that
the difference between the two coefficients (D_high lendable

This table reports results from using a different specification of short-selling potential and repeating the analysis of Tables 2 and 3 in the full sample as a robustness
check. D_low lendable is equal to one if the variable Lendable is below the bottom quartile of the monthly cross-sectional distribution. D_high lendable is equal to one if
the variable Lendable is above the top quartile of the monthly cross-sectional distribution. Panel A repeats Table 2's conditional logit regression analysis. Panel B

and D_low lendable) is statistically significant. Unreported tests
using different thresholds (e.g., to define the two dummy
variables to represent top/bottom 10% of values of lendable
shares) lead to very similar results. These observations suggest
that high values of lendable shares indeed proxy for high short-
selling potential, which induces more insider sales in our
empirical framework.17

Second, we consider an alternative measure of insider
trading and focus on the five most powerful insiders in the
company, whom the Thomson Insider Database classifies as
“level 1 insiders”. These are: the chief executive officer, the
chairman of the board, the chief operating officer, the president,
and the general counsel. We therefore re-estimate the previous
specifications using this new definition of insiders, and report
the results in Table 9. Panel A repeats Table 2's conditional logit
regression analysis. Panel B repeats Table 3's Heckman regres-
sion analysis. The results confirm those presented above, both

17 This test also addresses the potential concern that high lendable
shares may not be powerful enough to capture the potential impact of
short sellers because not all lendable shares are utilized in normal days.
Table 8 illustrates that high values of lendable shares, regardless of their
potential utilization rate, have significant power. This observation is
reasonable because insiders' ex ante concern about trading competition
should be more affected by the maximum amount of shares lendable to
short sellers (i.e., a measure of the potential capacity to short). We also
consider another short-selling potential variable that takes into account
the utilization rate of the lendable shares. We exclude the utilized shares
from the lendable shares, which measures the portion of the shares
outstanding that are currently not on loan and thus are available for
borrowing. Then we repeat the analysis in Tables 2 and 3. The results are
qualitatively the same and for brevity we do not report them here.

in terms of statistical significance and economic relevance, as
the coefficients remain statistically significant and their magni-
tudes are in general larger than those in Table 2. We also
experiment with the top three insiders, as in Cohen, Malloy,
and Pomorsky (2012), and obtain a similar result.

Third, given that the measure for the speed of trading
we use is novel, we provide an alternative measure in this
section to check the robustness of the related results.
Specifically, we define InsiderSale_Duration as the weighted
average of days that insiders take to complete sales in a
given month, with the weights determined by the total
dollar value of each day's net sales. Compared with the
previous measure InsiderSale_TimeSpan, this measure effec-
tively assigns a greater weight to days that have a larger
volume of net insider sales. We then examine the impact of
short selling on this alternative measure of trading speed.
The results are presented in Table 10, with a layout similar
to that of Table 3, Panel B. The evidence confirms a negative
impact of short-selling potential on the pace of insider trading.
A higher level of lendable shares is associated with a decrease
in the duration of insider sale transactions (as captured by
InsiderSale_Duration), and the decrease in duration is particu-
larly substantial for opportunistic insider sale transactions.

Finally, we address the potential concern that the
occurrence of insider sales is not randomly distributed
among firms. For example, the determinants of an insider
sale may be correlated with other firm characteristics,
differentiating the sample of firms with insider sales from
that without insider sales. Such differences may bias our
inference of the impact of short selling on insider sales. To
address this issue, we consider a matching sample

the regression coefficient of Lendable on InsiderSale_Frac-
Stake in Panel B, column 1 is 0.211 (with a t-statistic of
14.86). In the tests reported in Table 3, the corresponding
coefficient is 0.202 (with a t-statistic of 14.95). Similarly,
the coefficient of Lendable on Log(InsiderSale_TimeSpan) is
 0.634 (with a t-statistic of  7.50) in column 3 of Panel B
of the current table, compared with the coefficient of
 0.394 (with a t-statistic of  5.31) reported in Panel B
of Table 3. Therefore, the main findings remain very
similar using a more homogeneous control group of firms
with comparable characteristics.

7. Conclusion

We study how the presence of short sellers alters
insiders' incentives to trade. Trading competition by short
sellers incentivizes insiders to expedite their information
processing and trading activities to preempt short sellers,
enhancing both the scope and speed of insider sales.

We test this hypothesis using monthly data on US.
stocks over the period from 2006 to 2011. We document
that short-selling potential strongly encourages insiders to
participate in open market sales. If we decompose the
open market sales into routine and opportunistic sales, the
impact of lendable shares concentrates in opportunistic
sales. Thus, short selling primarily affects informed

insiders. If we condition on insider selling, we find that
with high levels of lendable shares, insiders tend to sell a
higher portion of their existing stakes and expedite their
sale transactions, confirming that short selling incentivizes
insiders to both sell more and sell faster. Our results
remain qualitatively unchanged when we conduct robust-
ness checks using an alternative sample of firms and an
alternative definition of corporate insiders.

A natural experiment based on the SHO Pilot Program
that exogenously relaxes short-selling restrictions provides
an opportunity to test the causal impact of short-selling
potential on insider sales. Among otherwise comparable
firms (both before and after announcement), we observe a
significant increase in the open market insider sales of
officers and directors among the Pilot stocks after the
announcement, relative to the change in open market
insider sales for the control firms. In addition, treatment
firms' insiders sold more shares and sold them faster after
the announcement of the SHO Pilot Program, relative to the
control firms' insiders. The results from an instrumental
variable analysis using ETF ownership as an exogenous
determinant of lendable shares complement and confirm
the findings in the quasi-experimental approach.

We also find that the effect of short-selling potential on
insider selling is amplified when short sellers' attention is
higher. Moreover, the return predictability of insider sales

InsiderSale_FracStake Number of shares sold on the open market
by officers and directors as a proportion of
their initial ownership in a given firm-month
InsiderSale_TimeSpan The number of days that an insider takes to

is only observed among stocks with high shorting poten-
tial, suggesting that short sellers indirectly enhance the
informativeness of firm's share prices via insider sales.

Overall, our results suggest that insiders' trading motiva-
tion and behavior could be substantially affected by the
conditions of the shorting market. The availability of short
selling introduces a competition scheme that accelerates the
rate at which private information is revealed to the market via
insider trading. In addition, the findings in the paper have
implications concerning the unintended consequences of
limiting short selling.

An insider is considered a routine trader if he
has been trading in the same calendar
months over the prior three years. A routine
sale is one made by a routine insider in the
same calendar month in which the insider
traded over the past three years (Cohen,
Malloy, and Pomorsky, 2012). All routine-
related insider sale variables are defined
using this definition.
An opportunistic insider is one for whom
there is no obvious discernible pattern in the
past timing of their trades over the past
three years. An opportunistic sale is one
made by an opportunistic insider.
Opportunistic-related insider sale variables

Abnormal sentiment We compute the monthly “sentiment score”
of a firm by averaging the scores assigned by
RavenPack over all news events reported in
the month. We define Abnormal sentiment as
the difference between the sentiment score
in the current month and the average
monthly sentiment score over the previous
three months.
Dummy variable equal to one if the firm's
number of negative news events is above the
monthly median in the sample. The number
of negative news is defined as (the logarithm
of) the average number of news events that
have a negative Abnormal sentiment score in
a given month for each firm minus the (log
of) the average number of news events that
have a negative Abnormal sentiment score in
the previous three months.
Dummy variable equal to one if there is an
open market sale by any insider (as recorded
in Form 4 of the Insider Filings in the current
month) and zero otherwise
Dummy variable equal to one if directors and
