Capital Tax Reform and the Real Economy:  
The Effects of the 2003 Dividend Tax Cut†

By Danny Yagan*

This  paper  tests  whether  the  2003  dividend  tax  cut—one  of  the 
largest reforms ever to a US capital tax rate—stimulated corporate 
investment and increased labor earnings, using a quasi-experimental 
design  and  US  corporate  tax  returns  from  years  1996–2008.  I 
estimate that the tax cut caused zero change in corporate investment 
and employee compensation. Economically, the statistical precision 
challenges  leading  estimates  of  the  cost-of-capital  elasticity  of 
investment,  or  undermines  models  in  which  dividend  tax  reforms 
affect the cost of capital. Either way, it may be difficult to implement 
an  alternative  dividend  tax  cut  that  has  substantially  larger  near-
term effects. (JEL C72, C78, C91)

The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 reduced the top fed-
eral tax rate on individual dividend income in the United States from 38.6 percent to 
15 percent. The president projected that the tax cut would provide “near-term sup-
port to investment” and “capital to build factories, to buy equipment, hire more peo-
ple.”1 The underlying rationale finds support in economics: traditional models imply 
that dividend tax cuts substantially reduce firms’ cost of capital (Harberger 1962, 
1966; Feldstein 1970; Poterba and Summers 1985), and investment appears highly 
responsive to the cost of capital (Hall and Jorgenson 1967; Cummins, Hassett, and 
Hubbard 1994; Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger 1995). Similar arguments moti-
vate ongoing proposals to use capital tax reforms to increase near-term output (Ryan 
2011, 2012; Hubbard et al. 2012).2

However, there is no direct evidence on the real effects of the 2003 dividend tax 
cut, for the simple reason that real corporate outcomes are too cyclical to distinguish 
tax  effects  from  business  cycle  effects. Aggregate  investment  rose  31  percent  in 
the five years after the tax cut, but that increase could have been driven by secular 
emergence from the early 2000s recession. Indeed, aggregate investment rose by 
34 percent in the five years following the early 1990s recession despite no dividend 
tax cut. As a result, existing work on the real effects of dividend taxes has relied 
on indirect evidence such as the goodness-of-fit of alternative structural investment 
equations (Poterba and Summers 1983).
This paper tests for real effects of the 2003 dividend tax cut by using a set of 
unaffected corporations to control for the business cycle. Upon incorporating at the 
state level, US corporations adopt either “C” or “S” status for federal tax purposes. 
C-corporations and S-corporations face similar tax rates except that C-corporations 
are subject to dividend taxation while S-corporations are not. S-status typically con-
fers tax advantages, but restrictions on the number and type of shareholders pre-
vent corporations with publicly traded stock, with any institutional equity financing, 
or with any divisions between ownership and control from enjoying S-status. This 
paper uses S-corporations (not directly affected by the dividend tax cut) as a control 
group for C-corporations (directly affected) over time.3
The identifying assumption underlying this research design is not random assign-
ment of C- versus S-status; it is that C- and S-corporation outcomes would have 
trended similarly in the absence of the tax cut. Three facts support this “common 
trends” assumption. First, C- and S-corporations of the same ages operate in the 
same  narrow  industries  and  at  the  same  scale  throughout  the  United  States  and 
are  thus  subject  to  similar  cyclical  shocks.  Second,  contemporaneous  stimulative 
tax  provisions  like  accelerated  depreciation  applied  almost  identically. Third  and 
perhaps  most  important,  key  outcomes  empirically  trended  similarly  for  C-  and 
S-corporations in the several years before 2003.

This paper uses rich data from US corporate income tax returns from years 1996 
to 2008. All publicly traded corporations, and thus the absolute largest corporations, 
are C-corporations; I therefore focus on a stratified random sample of private C- and 
S-corporations with assets between one million and one billion dollars (the nine-
tieth and 99.9th percentiles of the US firm size distribution) and revenue between 
0.5 million and 1.5 billion dollars. Based on Census Bureau data, firms in this size 
range  employ  over  half  of  all  US  private  sector  workers.  In  the  tax  data,  C-  and 
S-corporations  in  this  range  are  densely  populated  within  fine  industry-firm-size 
bins, and all results flexibly control for time-varying industry-firm-size shocks. This 
paper’s main sample is an unbalanced panel comprising 333,029 annual observa-
tions from 73,188 corporations, 58 percent of which are C-corporations; I obtain 

wages, lowering costs, and providing greater returns on investment” (Ryan 2011) and to prevent “raising taxes on 
investing at a time when new business investment is critical for sustaining the weak economic recovery” (Ryan 
2012). Hubbard et al. (2012, p. 5) predicted that Governor Mitt Romney’s proposed capital and labor income tax 
reforms “will increase GDP growth by between 0.5 percent and 1 percent per year over the next decade.” 
3 To the extent that an increase in C-corporation investment displaced S-corporation investment, this empirical 
design overstates the magnitude of the aggregate effect. The design tests for the canonical price effect of dividend 
taxation; indirect effects such as wealth effects among savers that could have increased or decreased worldwide 
corporate investment are outside the scope of this paper. Switching between corporate types is rare. 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWdECEMbER 20153533

qualitatively similar results in balanced panel regressions in which the only firm-
level variable changing over time is the outcome of interest.

I  find  that  annual  C-corporation  investment  trended  similarly  to  annual 
S-corporation investment before 2003 and continued to do so after 2003. The differ-
ence-in-differences point estimate implies an elasticity of investment with respect to 
one minus the top statutory dividend tax rate of  0.00  with a 95 percent confidence 
interval of  −0 .08  to  0.08  , equivalent to  −0.03  to  0.03  standard deviations of firm-
level investment.
The finding of no significant increase in investment is robust across alternative 
specifications (with  and  without  controls),  sample  frames (unbalanced  and  bal-
anced  panels),  investment  measures (gross  investment  and  net  investment),  out-
lier  top-coding (at  the  ninety-fifth  and  ninety-ninth  percentiles),  and  subsamples 
(defined by size, age, growth, profitability, cash, and debt). I further find a negative 
point  estimate  and  a  95  percent  confidence  upper  bound  elasticity  of   0.04  ( 0.02  
standard  deviations)  for  the  related  and  independently  relevant  outcome  of  total 
employee compensation. Results remain unchanged when including the 76 percent 
of publicly traded corporations that fall in this paper’s size range and become nega-
tive when including all publicly traded corporations.
To confirm the tax cut’s salience and relevance in spite of the lack of detectable 
real  effects,  I  test  for  an  effect  on  total  payouts  to  shareholders (dividends  plus 
share buybacks)—the focus of the existing academic debate over the effects of this 
tax reform (Chetty and Saez 2005; Brown, Liang, and Weisbenner 2007; Blouin, 
Raedy, and Shackelford 2011; Edgerton 2013). I find that C-corporation payouts 
spiked immediately in 2003 by  21 percent  relative to S-corporation payouts, with a  
t -statistic over  5 . The payouts effect was large and persistent in percentage terms but 
small in dollar terms and is consistent with a small dollar-for-dollar displacement 
of  C-corporation  investment,  or  alternatively  with  a  mere  reshuffling  of  financial 
claims that had no real effects.

These core results do not necessarily apply to corporations that were smaller or 
larger than the firm size range analyzed here, so I test for real effects of the tax cut 
within each firm size decile and ask whether the results suggest that out-of-sample 
effects were likely different. For each real outcome, I find a zero effect within every 
firm size decile and no upward or downward trend across deciles. Hence, I do not 
find evidence suggestive of different out-of-sample results.

Finally, a recent model notes that a dividend tax cut can increase the productiv-
ity of investment even if it does not increase its level, by causing poorly-managed 
C-corporations to reduce wasteful investment and to increase payouts while causing 
other C-corporations to increase productive investment via increased equity issuance 
(Chetty and Saez 2010). When dividing the sample by each of six firm characteristics 
(size, age, growth, profitability, cash, and debt), I find no relationship between the 
subgroups that increased payouts the most and those that increased equity issuance 
the least. Thus I do not find evidence in favor of this  efficiency-enhancing channel.
This paper complements a large empirical literature that has found substantial 
real  effects  of  other  fiscal  policies.  Temporary  countercyclical  policies  such  as 
accelerated investment depreciation (House and Shapiro 2008; Zwick and Mahon 
2014), individual income tax rebates (Johnson, Parker, and Souleles 2006), and tem-
porary durable goods subsidies (Mian and Sufi 2012) have increased at least some

 component of aggregate spending. Many studies have shown that labor income taxes 
reduce labor supply (see Chetty 2012 for a recent review);  q -theory-based regres-
sions  suggest  that  corporate  income  taxes  reduce  investment (Cummins,  Hassett, 
and  Hubbard  1994);  and  the  pooled  effect  on  near-term  output  of  labor  income, 
capital income, and other tax reforms since World War II was substantial (Romer 
and Romer 2010). This paper contributes to this literature by documenting that in 
contrast to numerous other fiscal policies, the 2003 dividend tax cut—one of the 
largest changes ever to a US capital income tax rate—had no detectable near-term 
impact on the real outcomes it was projected to improve.

The  null  result  relates  to  theory  and  to  alternative  dividend  tax  reforms. 
Economically, the null result rejects the joint hypothesis that the tax cut substan-
tially  reduced  firms’  cost  of  capital  as  in  traditional  models  and  that  investment 
responded to the cost of capital as much as leading estimates predict. In particu-
lar, combining the leading “traditional-view” model of dividend taxation (Poterba 
and  Summers  1985)  with  consensus  estimates  of  the  cost-of-capital  elasticity  of 
investment (Hassett and Hubbard 2002) would predict a dividend tax elasticity of 
investment range of  0.21  to  0.41 —at least 2.5 times the 95 percent confidence upper 
bound of this paper’s empirical estimate.
The null result accords instead with the leading class of alternative models (the 
“new  view”  or  “trapped  equity  view”  of  dividend  taxation)  in  which  marginal 
investments are funded out of retained earnings and riskless debt rather than out of 
newly issued equity or risky debt (King 1977; Auerbach 1979; Bradford 1981). The 
key mechanism is that earnings from preexisting operations will inevitably be sub-
ject to dividend taxes (whether paid out immediately or paid out in the future after 
being retained for investment), so a dividend tax cut increases the post-tax return on 
investment by the same magnitude that it increases the opportunity cost of invest-
ment, inducing no investment change.4

Traditional models of dividend taxation can nevertheless explain the null result 
as due to particular features of this dividend tax cut and other tax rates, as detailed 
in Section V. The bottom line from that discussion is that even in that case, it may 
be difficult for policymakers to implement an alternative dividend tax cut that sub-
stantially increases near-term investment. For example, the 2003 dividend tax cut 
carried a default expiration date, and it is possible that a permanent dividend tax 
cut would have substantially increased investment. However, the United States has 
never committed to a near-term or long-term path for tax policy so the required lon-
gevity may be infeasible to guarantee: the 2003 dividend tax cut has outlasted many 
tax reforms that had no expiration date, and a majority of G7 countries have revised 
their dividend tax rates up or down substantially since 2003.

The  corporate  finance  literature  on  the  2003  dividend  tax  cut  has  focused  on 
whether the post-2003 increase in dividend payouts from publicly traded corpora-
tions (Chetty and Saez 2005) represented an increase in total corporate payouts or 
was offset by an equal reduction in share buybacks (Brown, Liang, and Weisbenner 
2007; Blouin, Raedy, and Shackelford 2011; Edgerton 2013). This paper shows that 
the tax cut indeed increased total corporate payouts—a finding again made possible

the dividend tax rate.

by  the  S-corporation  control  group  because,  like  investment,  share  buybacks  are 
very procyclical.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the 2003 
dividend tax cut and the distinction between C- and S-corporations. Section II intro-
duces the tax data. Section III estimates real effects of the 2003 dividend tax cut. 
Section IV confirms salience and relevance by analyzing payouts. Section V details 
economic and policy implications. Section VI concludes.

I.  C- versus S-Corporations and the 2003 Tax Reform

A. C- versus S-Status

After  filing  incorporation  documents  at  the  state  level,  US  corporations  elect 
either “C” or “S” status for federal tax purposes. C-corporations pay the corporate 
income tax on annual taxable income, and US shareholders pay dividend taxes on 
dividends and pay capital gains taxes on qualified share buybacks. S-corporations—
named after their subchapter of the Internal Revenue Code—have the same legal 
structure as C-corporations but for tax purposes are flow-through entities that do not 
pay an entity-level income tax. Instead, taxable business income flows through pro 
rata to individual shareholders’ tax returns and is taxed as ordinary income in the 
year it is earned, regardless of whether the income is actually distributed to share-
holders that year.5 When distributed, S-corporation dividends are untaxed.6
S-status typically confers tax advantages (detailed in the next subsection), but 
not all corporations qualify for S-status. The most important restrictions are that the 
corporation must have no more than 100 shareholders, all shareholders must be US 
citizens or residents and not business entities, and the corporation must have only 
one class of stock. Thus all publicly traded corporations, corporations financed with 
venture capital, corporations partially or wholly owned by private equity or other 
firms, corporations that widely use stock-based compensation, and corporations that 
use stock classes to divide ownership from control cannot be S-corporations. Despite 
these restrictions some very large corporations are publicly-known S-corporations 
such as Fidelity Investments.7 Corporations can switch status and I account for this 
in the analysis below, though consecutively switching back and forth is restricted 
by law and switching is rare empirically because most factors that bar S-status (e.g., 
institutional shareholders) are persistent.
Except for the very largest corporations which are all publicly traded and are thus 
C-corporations, C- and S-corporations of the same ages operate in the same nar-
row industries and at the same scales across the United States. For example, online 
Appendix Figure 1A uses data from the full population of US corporate tax returns 

their character and are taxed as dividend income or capital gains at the shareholder level. 

5 Taxable dividend income or capital gains earned by S-corporations (e.g., on passively held securities) retain 
6 The tax treatment of C- and S-corporations differ in other, smaller ways. For example, C-corporations can 
deduct charitable deductions up to only 10 percent of taxable income whereas S-corporations face limits at the 
individual shareholder level. S-corporations are taxed similarly to partnerships; relative to partnerships which were 
not analyzed for this paper, S-corporations may be a more appropriate control group for C-corporations because, 
aside from taxes, C- and S-corporations have identical legal rights and responsibilities.

to  plot  the  distribution  of  C-  and  S-corporations  by  1-digit  NAICS  classification 
for all 397,008 corporations in 2002 that satisfy the size and industry restrictions 
in this paper, detailed in Section IIB.8 The figure shows that C- and S-corporations 
are relatively evenly distributed across major industries. Zeroing in on the 23,892 
corporations in the most-common 3-digit NAICS classification (wholesale durable 
goods  trade),  online Appendix  Figure  1B  shows  the  even  distribution  of  C-  and 
S-corporations across narrow 4-digit industries. Online Appendix Figure 1C simi-
larly shows even distributions of firm size. Online Appendix Figure 1D uses public 
data  on  two  large  corporations (Home  Depot  and  Menard  Inc.,  respectively,  the 
country’s largest and third-largest home improvement retailers) to illustrate a spe-
cific example of publicly known C- and S-corporations operating in the same nar-
row industry and in the same locale (the Chicago metropolitan area).
C-  and  S-corporations  differ  along  some  notable  dimensions.  For  example, 
C-corporations tend to be more asset-intensive and less-profitable than S-corporations 
after  controlling  for  revenue  and  industry.  Nevertheless,  the  substantial  overlap 
demonstrated in online Appendix Figure 1—and below in Figure 1 and Table 1 for 
the main analysis sample—by industry and size suggests that even if the corporation 
types differ in the level of outcomes, they may share common trends because they 
share any time-varying industry and firm-size shocks. Common trends is the condi-
tion required for identification below. Later, I demonstrate empirically that C- and 
S-corporation outcomes indeed trended similarly before 2003.

B. The 2003 Tax Reform

On May 28, 2003, President George W. Bush signed into law the Jobs and Growth 
Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. This tax reform reduced the marginal fed-
eral dividend income tax rate from 38.6 percent to 15 percent for the recipients of 
most taxable dividends.9 President Bush proposed the reform on January 7, 2003; 
it applied retroactively to January 1, 2003; and the dividend tax proposal appears to 
have been largely unanticipated (Auerbach and Hassett 2007). As the name of the 
law (“Jobs and Growth”) and the paper’s introductory quotes from President Bush 
indicate, the tax cut’s supporters argued that it would affect real economic outcomes 
beginning in the near-term.
The tax reform changed three other relevant provisions. It reduced the top capital 
gains tax rate (the rate assessed on income earned from qualified share buybacks) 
from  20  percent  to  15  percent.  It  expanded  temporary  accelerated  depreciation 
for equipment and light structures investment through 2004, which applied nearly 

8 These  unedited  population  data  lack  investment  and  other  key  variables  and  so  are  used  only  for  online 
Appendix Figures 1A–1C. 
9 The  tax  reform  reduced  the  marginal  tax  rate  on  qualified (i.e.,  from  US  or  tax-treaty-qualifying   foreign 
corporation  stock  held  for  at  least  60  days)  and  taxable (i.e.,  not  from  S-corporations  or  accrued  to  tax-pre-
ferred  accounts)  dividends  for  individual  taxpayers  in  the  top  4  ordinary  income  tax  brackets  from  27  per-
cent,  30  percent,  35  percent,  and  38.6  percent  to  15  percent,  and  for  taxpayers  in  the  bottom  2   ordinary 
income  tax  brackets  from  10  percent  or  15  percent  to  5  percent.  Most  taxable  dividends  accrue  to  taxpay-
ers  in  the  top  ordinary  income  tax  bracket  and  approximately  90  percent  accrue  to  taxpayers  in  the  top  4.  
The tax reform did not change the tax treatment of dividends received by individuals in tax-favored savings accounts 
or by nonprofit, corporate, or government entities.

Notes:  This  figure  plots  the  industry  and  size  mix  of  the  C-corporations  (whose  dividends  are  taxable)  and 
S-corporations (whose  dividends  are  not  taxable)  in  this  paper’s  main  analysis  sample.  Each  graph’s  bars  sum 
to 100 percent within corporation type. Lagged revenue denotes operating revenue averaged over the preceding 
two lags. This sample is an unbalanced panel of annual corporate income tax returns, comprising all observations 
from the IRS Statistics of Income stratified random sample in years 1998–2008 in which the filing corporation 
had between $1 million and $1 billion in lagged assets and $500,000 and $1.5 billion in lagged revenue, was pri-
vate through the previous year, and is not in the finance or utilities industries. All analyses flexibly control for any 
time-varying industry or firm-size shocks by non-parametrically reweighting the S-corporation sample within every 
year to match the distribution of C-corporations across 190 industry-firm-size bins as detailed in Section IIE. C- 
versus S-status is defined as of the second lag; corporations can switch status if they meet the legal requirements but 
fewer than 4 percent ever switched in this sample. See Table 1 for summary statistics.

Notes:  This  table  lists  unweighted  summary  statistics  for  C-corporations (whose  dividends  are  taxable)  and 
S-corporations (whose dividends are not taxable) in this paper’s main analysis sample: an unbalanced panel of 
annual corporate income tax returns, comprising all observations from the IRS Statistics of Income stratified ran-
dom sample in years 1998−2008 in which the filing corporation had between $1 million and $1 billion in lagged 
assets and $500,000 and $1.5 billion in lagged revenue, was private through the previous year, and is not in the 
finance or utilities industries. Lagged denotes averaged over the two preceding lags. Revenue equals operating reve-
nue. Assets equals the book value of assets. Tangible capital assets, also called capital, equals the book value of tan-
gible capital assets (e.g., excluding cash and patents). Profit margin equals one minus the ratio of operating costs to 
revenue. Cash equals liquid current assets. Leverage equals the book value of non-equity liabilities divided by assets 
(this is greater than one when accumulated losses exceed paid-in equity). Age equals the year of the return minus 
the year of incorporation. Investment equals the cost of all newly purchased tangible capital assets. Net investment 
equals the annual dollar change in tangible capital assets. Employee compensation equals the sum of all non- officer 
wages, salaries, benefits, and pension contributions. Dividends equals cash plus property distributions to sharehold-
ers. Payouts, also called total payouts to shareholders, equals dividends plus share buybacks ( non-negative annual 
changes in treasury stock). Equity issued equals non-negative annual changes in paid-in capital. C- versus S-status 
is defined as of the second lag; corporations can switch status if they meet the legal requirements but fewer than 4 
percent ever switched in this sample. All monetary figures are in 2010 dollars.

 identically  to  C-  and  S-corporations.10  And  it  accelerated  the  already-legislated 
phase-in  of  reductions  in  individual  ordinary  income  tax  rates,  such  as  immedi-
ately reducing the top rate from 38.6 percent to 35 percent rather than waiting for 
it  to  fall  to  37.6  percent  in  2004  and  35  percent  in  2006.  S-corporation  income 
(as well as dividend income until 2003) is taxed as ordinary income, but because 
the  small  reduction  in  ordinary  income  tax  rates  was  merely  an  acceleration  and 
based on evidence presented in Section IIIE, I make the simplification of consider-
ing S-corporation income tax rates to have been unaffected. The tax reform did not 
change the corporate income tax schedule.
The 2003 dividend tax cut was originally legislated to expire in 2009 but was 
extended to 2013 and has now been made “permanent” (i.e., with no default expira-
tion date) in nearly its original form. In late 2005 Congress proposed to extend the 
tax cut until 2011, and President Bush signed it into law in May 2006.11 In 2010, 
Congress and President Barack Obama extended it again until 2013. In the first days 
of 2013, President Obama signed into law a permanent extension of the tax cut for 
all individuals with taxable income below $400,000 and married couples with tax-
able income below $450,000, as well as a permanent marginal dividend tax rate of 
20 percent for taxpayers with taxable income above these thresholds. In Section VB, 
I discuss the possible implications of the original default expiration dates.

The  OECD  reports  that  when  considering  federal  and  average  state  tax  rates, 
the 2003 tax reform reduced the top statutory dividend tax rate from 44.7 percent 
to 20.8 percent. In the empirical analysis below, I report elasticities with respect to 
one minus this top statutory rate.12 One minus the dividend tax rate is the relevant 
entity  for  parameterizing  traditional  models  as  I  illustrate  in  Section V. The  vast 
majority of taxable dividend income accrues to households in the top tax bracket. 
Shares of private corporations (the focus of this paper) are unlikely to be held by 
dividend-tax-exempt investors like pension funds or by taxpayers in the lowest div-
idend tax brackets. And unlike public company share buybacks, private corporation 
share buybacks are typically taxed as dividends rather than capital gains (and indeed 
share buybacks are relatively uncommon in my sample).13 Readers can apply their 
own assumed tax change to the raw estimates as they see fit; for example, one could 
assume that private C-corporation dividends faced the average taxable dividend tax 
rates for the total US economy, which Poterba (2004) reports fell from 32.1 percent 
to 18.5 percent.

10 The exception is that owners of S-corporations with current losses could deduct the depreciation allowances 
from any current wage or other ordinary income on their 1040s, while C-corporations must carry forward the tax 
benefit to future years’ profit. Thus the 2003 tax reform could, in principle, have benefited low-profit S-corporations 
relative to low-profit C-corporations. However, the negative point estimate in Table 3, column 1, row 4 (introduced 
in Section IIIC) suggests that this was not a relevant confound. 
11 This law also lowered the bottom dividend tax rate from 5 percent to 0 percent beginning in 2008 and was set 
to expire in 2011 but never did before being made permanent in 2013. 
12 See OECD Tax Database Table II4 (http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database.htm). Elasticities with 
respect to the tax rate are 19 percent smaller in absolute value; one minus the tax rate is the element relevant for 
theory. 

13 IRS rules require a share buyback to materially change ownership in order to qualify as a capital gain. This 
may be easier to do with dispersed shareholders who trade their stock in public markets than it is for concentrated 
shareholders who do not.

II.  Data

A. SOI Sample of US Corporate Income Tax Returns

This  paper  uses  a  large  stratified  random  sample  of  US  corporate  income  tax 
returns  from  years  1996–2008.  Each  year  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS) 
Statistics of Income (SOI) division randomly samples corporate income tax returns, 
edits many variables for accuracy and consistency, and uses them to publish aggre-
gate  statistics.  The  sampling  percentages  are  a  function  of  assets  and  a  measure 
of  net  income;  corporations  with  at  least  $50  million  in  assets  are  sampled  with 
probability one and progressively smaller corporations are sampled at progressively 
smaller  rates.  Corporations  sampled  in  one  year  are  typically  though  not  always 
sampled in subsequent years, so the SOI sample constitutes an unbalanced panel.14 
The fine reweighting I detail in Section IIE accounts for any differential changes 
over time in the sampling percentages.

The  SOI  sample  has  three  key  advantages  relative  to  the  commonly  used 
Compustat database on corporations: it contains data on both C-corporations and 
S-corporations,  it  contains  data  on  many  young  corporations,  and  it  has  a  much 
larger sample size even of relatively large corporations. As detailed below, this paper 
focuses  on  corporations  with  between  $1  million  and  $1  billion  in  assets.  Most 
Compustat corporations fall in this asset range but the SOI sample contains obser-
vations on many more such firms, including in the range $500 million to $1 billion.

B. Analysis Sample

This paper focuses on corporations in the SOI sample with between $1 million 
and $1 billion in assets (the 89.7th and 99.9th percentiles of the 2002 US  pooled C- 
and S-corporation size distribution) and with revenue between $0.5 million and $1.5 
billion (i.e., within 50 percent of either asset threshold) in 2010 dollars, for three 
reasons. The  $1  million  lower  bound  restricts  attention  to  corporations  operating 
at substantial scale and lies comfortably above a reporting threshold that restricts 
the  balance  sheet  information  available  on  corporations  with  less  than  $250,000 
in  assets. Almost  all  of  the  very  largest  corporations  are  publicly  traded  and  are 
therefore C-corporations, so the $1 billion upper bound ensures substantial overlap 
between C- and S-corporations across size bins. And corporations in this size range 
are quantitatively important: firms in this size range employ over half of all US pri-
vate sector workers.15

The  main  analysis  sample  is  an  unbalanced  panel  of  corporations  constructed 
from  the  SOI  samples. The  unbalanced  panel  includes  a  corporation’s  year   t   tax 
return  if  the  corporation: (i)  had  assets  in  the  range  $1  million  to  $1  billion  and 

14 The sampling is done using a deterministic function of the last four digits of the corporation’s employer iden-

tification number, so corporations sampled in one year are usually sampled the next as well. 

15 Corporate  income  tax  returns  do  not  include  employment.  In  the  most  recent  Census  Bureau  release 
with  employment  statistics  by  firm  revenue,  45.2  percent  of  private  sector  employees  were  employed  by  firms 
with  between  $500,000  and  $100  million  in  revenue  (http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/data/susb2007.html). 
Employment at firms with revenue between $100 million and $1.5 billion is not reported separately; I estimate 
that an additional 5.3 percent to 18.5 percent of private sector employees are employed at firms with between $100 
million and $1.5 billion in revenue. 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWdECEMbER 20153541

 revenue in the range $0.5 million to $1.5 billion on average between years  t – 2  and  
t – 1  (so that lagged values can be used for scaling); (ii) was private at least until year  
t – 2  (since  all  S-corporations  are  private);  and (iii)—as  restricted  in  earlier  work 
on the 2003 dividend tax cut (Chetty and Saez 2005)—is not a financial company 
(whose main productive assets are typically not tangible capital) or a utility com-
pany (to which unique regulations apply). I further discard any tax returns that con-
tain missing variable values or in which the filing months of consecutive tax years 
indicate that the tax return did not cover a full 12 month period.

I use the unbalanced panel for all main results due to its simplicity and inclusive-
ness.  However,  it  has  the  potential  disadvantage  of  a  changing  composition  over 
time. I therefore repeat all analyses using a balanced panel constructed similarly 
to the unbalanced panel except that it includes the same corporations in every year. 
The  balanced  panel  comprises  annual  observations  on  corporations  that: (i)  filed 
tax returns in all years 1996–2008; (ii) had assets in the range of $1 million to $1 
billion and revenue in the range of $0.5 million to $1.5 billion average over years 
1996–1997; (iii) were private through 1997; and (iv) are outside the financial and 
utilities industries. As I describe in Section IIIB, the balanced panel allows me to 
conduct the regression analysis such that the outcome of interest is the only firm-
level variable changing from year to year. However, the balanced panel carries the 
obvious drawbacks of omitting corporations that are young in the post-2003 era and 
of requiring survival through 2008.

C. Variable Definitions

The SOI data contain the variables necessary for this paper’s analysis: assets, rev-
enue, investment, tangible capital assets, net investment, employee compensation, 
dividends,  total  payouts  to  shareholders,  equity  issued,  profit  margin,  cash,  debt, 
NAICS industry classification, and age. All variables are constructed from annual 
corporate income tax returns filed by the corporation. This section defines variables 
in economic terms; online Appendix A defines them in terms of line items on tax 
forms.

C-corporations file the corporate income tax Form 1120 and S-corporations file 
the similar Form 1120S. Year  t  refers to the corporation’s tax filing that covered July 
of calendar year  t . Each observation’s C- versus S-status is defined as of its filing 
in year  t – 2 ; this means, for example, that a spike in C-corporation payouts in 2003 
refers to corporations that filed a Form 1120 in 2001. Results are insensitive to this 
choice.

Investment equals the purchase price of all newly installed capital assets logged 
on  Form  4562,  filed  alongside  the  corporate  income  tax  return  in  order  to  claim 
depreciation deductions.16 The US tax code permits a corporation to deduct the pur-
chase price of newly acquired capital assets (i.e., both new and used capital assets 
as long as they are new to the corporation) from its taxable income. The corporation 
typically  cannot  deduct  the  entire  amount  immediately  and  instead  must  make  a 

16 Throughout this paper, “capital assets” refers to property depreciable under the US tax code (equipment and 
structures used in the trade or business). Thus “capital assets” is used here in its traditional economic sense rather 
than in the tax accounting sense of securities that generate passive income or similar assets. 

Yagan: Real effects of the 2003 DiviDenD tax cutvol. 105 no. 123542

sequence of depreciation deductions over several years, computed each year using 
Form  4562. To  a  close  approximation,  investment  eligible  for  depreciation  com-
prises the same capital goods included in NIPA private fixed non-residential invest-
ment statistics; see House and Shapiro (2008); Kitchen and Knittel (2011); and IRS 
Publication 946 for more details.17
Tangible capital assets (shortened to “capital” in table headings) equals the book 
value of all tangible (e.g., excluding goodwill) capital assets owned by corporation 
at  the  end  of  the  tax  year,  net  of  accumulated  book  depreciation.  I  compute  net 
investment as the annual dollar change in tangible capital assets, which equals new 
tangible  investment  less  tangible  capital  asset  retirements  and  accumulated  book 
depreciation. Employee compensation equals the sum of wages and salaries paid to 
non-officer employees, payments for employee benefit programs (e.g., health insur-
ance), and contributions to pension or employee-profit-sharing plan contributions.
Dividends  equals  the  sum  of  cash  and  property  distributions  to  shareholders. 
Total payouts to shareholders (sometimes shortened to “payouts”) equals dividends 
plus  share  buybacks—where  share  buybacks  are  defined  as  non-negative  annual 
dollar changes in treasury stock, the primary method used in Blouin, Raedy, and 
Shackelford (2011);  Skinner (2008);  and  Edgerton (2013).  Equity  issued  equals 
non-negative annual changes in total paid-in capital.
Assets equals total book assets. Revenue equals operating revenue. I use tax fields 
to define operating profit margin (sometimes shortened to “profit margin”) homoge-
neously for C-corporations and S-corporations. Operating profit margin equals oper-
ating revenue less cost of goods sold and all components of total deductions except 
interest,  depreciation,  domestic  production  activities,  and  officer   compensation 
deductions.18 Cash equals the sum of all liquid current assets. Debt equals the sum 
of  all  non-equity  liabilities.  For  each  corporation,  2-digit  NAICS  classification 
equals the first two digits of the 6-digit NAICS classification code reported on the 
corporate income tax return observed for each corporation that was filed nearest to 
2003. There  are  19  valid  2-digit  NAICS  classifications. Age  is  defined  similarly, 
using the date incorporation field reported on the return filed nearest to 2003.

D. Summary Statistics

Table 1 displays unweighted summary statistics for the main analysis sample (the 
unbalanced panel) by C- and S-status. All values are annual and all monetary amounts 
are in 2010 dollars. The sample comprises 195,033 annual observations on 43,988 
C-corporations  and  137,996  annual  observations  on  32,113  S-corporations.  The 
average C-corporation observation has lagged revenue of $69 million,  investment 
of $2.2 million, and employee compensation of $12 million; S-corporation averages 

17 Kitchen and Knittel (2011) demonstrate that SOI Form 4562 aggregates approximate NIPA investment sta-
tistics. Software, equipment, and structures are included; land and depletable assets (e.g., oil deposits) are not. New 
purchases of patents and certain other intangible assets can be logged as new investment. If the investment purchase 
is only partially used by the firm, only a portion is logged as new investment. US-based corporations with foreign 
operations typically establish wholly-owned foreign entities that are regarded as separate entities; property placed 
into service in separate entities do not appear on Form 4562. 

18 I exclude interest, depreciation, and domestic production activities deductions because they are not operating 
costs.  I  exclude  officer  compensation  because  private  corporations  may  have  leeway  in  the  timing  and  form  of 
compensating owner-managers. 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWdECEMbER 20153543

are similar. When weighted by lagged revenue as is done for all subsequent analyses 
(see  next  subsection),  the  average  lagged  revenue  in  the  sample  is  $281  million, 
so the average firm in this paper’s analysis operates at considerable scale. Figure 1 
shows  that  there  is  substantial  overlap  across  C-  and  S-corporations  by  industry 
and  size;  in  the  next  subsection,  I  explain  how  I  flexibly  account  for  any  differ-
ences along these dimensions. The size distribution of corporations is right-skewed, 
reflecting the right-skewness of the population firm size distribution. Fewer than 4 
percent of firms ever switched between C and S status.19

E. Weighting and Winsorizing

I specify the final weight used for each observation in online Appendix B; the for-
mula can be understood as the result of two steps. I initially weight each observation 
according to its revenue, averaged over the previous two lags. Thus each observation 
contributes to all graphs and regression estimates according to its economic scale, 
making  the  parameter  estimates  “dollar-weighted”  in  this  sense.  I  then  reweight 
the S-corporation sample to match the C-corporation sample along 190 size-indus-
try bins in order to flexibly control for time-varying size- or industry-based shocks 
using  the  reweighting  method  of  DiNardo,  Fortin,  and  Lemieux (1996)  that  is 
commonly used in labor economics when datasets are large enough to support it. 
Specifically,  after  initially  weighting  observations  by  their  lagged  revenue,  I  bin 
each corporation into one of 190 ( = 19  two-digit industries  ×   10   within-industry 
size  deciles)  bins  according  to  the  within-industry  size-decile  distribution  of 
C-corporations  in  2002. Then  within  each  corporation  type  and  year,  I  inflate  or 
deflate each bin’s weight so that each bin carries the same relative weight as the 
2002 distribution of C-corporations. This ensures, for example, that  time-varying 
shocks to large construction firms will not influence the results because large con-
struction firms will contribute to the results equally for each corporation type and 
in every year. Empirically, this reweighting turns out to be a careful precaution that 
makes  almost  no  quantitative  difference (compare  estimates  reported  in  Table 2 
 column 2 and online Appendix Table 4  column 10, introduced below) because C- 
and S-corporation industry distributions are very similar (Figure 1, panel A) and 
effect sizes are constant across firm sizes (Figure 3, introduced below).
Finally and unless otherwise specified, I winsorize (top-code) scaled outcomes 
(e.g., investment divided by lagged tangible capital assets) at the ninety-fifth per-
centile.20 I intentionally winsorize observations differently for the time series pan-
els of Figure 2 than I do for the regressions. The figures are intended to illustrate 
how investment and other outcomes change year-by-year and especially around the 
 passage of the 2003 dividend tax cut. Thus for the figures, I hold the winsorization 

19 The total number of corporations reported in the introduction is slightly smaller than the sum of the total 
number of C-corporations and the total number of S-corporations reported in Table 1 because of this small number 
of switching corporations. 

20 By “winsorize,”  I mean that any observations with values above the ninety-fifth percentile are assigned the 
ninety-fifth percentile value. Winsorizing removes the influence of data coding errors, which are occasionally pres-
ent even in the edited SOI samples. Even without data errors, winsorizing can be optimal when estimating means in 
finite samples from skewed distributions as one trades off bias with minimizing mean squared error (Rivest 1994). 
I  winsorize  controls  at  the  ninety-ninth  percentile  since  they’re  used  as  quartics;  winsorizing  at  the  ninety-fifth 
percentile yields nearly identical results.

Figure 2. Effects of the 2003 Dividend Tax Cut

 

Notes: These figures plot the time series of annual mean outcomes for C-corporations and S-corporations in the 
main analysis sample net of a rich set of controls. Investment equals the cost of all newly purchased tangible capi-
tal assets. Net investment equals the annual dollar change in tangible capital assets. Employee compensation equals 
the sum of all non-officer wages, salaries, benefits, and pension contributions. Total payouts to shareholders equals 
dividends plus share buybacks (non-negative annual changes in treasury stock). Each panel is constructed by scal-
ing each observation by either the firm’s tangible capital assets or revenue averaged over the two preceding lags; 
winsorizing (top-coding) observations at the ninety-fifth percentile; regressing this scaled outcome variable within 
every year on a C-corporation indicator, two-digit NAICS industry fixed effects, and quartics in age, lagged reve-
nue, lagged profit margin, and revenue growth; and requiring that the vertical distance between the two lines equals 
the regression coefficient on the C-corporation indicator and that the weighted average of the lines equals the sam-
ple  average  in  that  year. The  regressions  are  dollar-weighted (each  observation  is  weighted  by  its  lagged  reve-
nue) and flexibly control for any time-varying industry or firm-size shocks by non-parametrically reweighting the 
S-corporation sample within every year to match the distribution of C-corporations across 190 industry-firm-size 
bins as detailed in Section IIE. Panel D is included as a test for an immediate behavioral response in financial out-
comes and differs from the other graphs in two ways that account for income-tax-induced differences in baseline 
payout levels and for slightly differential pre-trends as detailed in Section IVA.

percentiles fixed across years and, in particular, use the pre-2003 distribution of the 
outcome to compute winsorization levels in all years. However, as will be relevant 
for the payouts outcome only, the tax cut can shift the outcome distribution (e.g., 
increasing the ninety-fifth percentile), and estimates of the impact of tax cut would 
ideally censor an equal share of observations over time. Thus for the regressions, I 
winsorize pre-2003 observations using the pre-2003 distribution of the outcome and

Figure 3. Effects by Size Decile

Notes: This figure plots estimated within-size-decile effects of the 2003 dividend tax cut in the main analysis sam-
ple. Variables are defined, scaled, and winsorized as detailed in Figure 2. Each y-axis height equals one standard 
deviation of the outcome. Each panel is computed by binning corporations into deciles according to the unweighted 
deciles of the pooled C-corporation lagged revenue distribution, and then within each decile estimating a regression 
of the outcome on a C-corporation indicator, the interaction of a C-corporation indicator and post-2003 indicator, 
year fixed effects, two-digit NAICS industry fixed effects, and quartics in age, lagged revenue, lagged profit margin, 
and revenue growth. Each panel plots the coefficients on the interaction term with Bonferroni-corrected 95 percent 
confidence intervals to adjust for multiple (ten) hypothesis testing; uncorrected confidence intervals are one-third 
tighter. Standard errors are clustered by firm. The solid line is the best unweighted linear fit through the coefficients. 
Observations are weighted analogously to Figure 2.

III.  Effect on Investment and Employee Compensation

I first test whether the 2003 dividend tax cut caused C-corporations to increase 
investment: a key real behavioral response suggested by policymakers and by eco-
nomic theory. I begin by presenting visual evidence and regression estimates of the 
effect of the tax cut on investment. I then present extensive robustness checks, tests 
for effects on employee compensation, heterogeneity analyses, tests for internal and 
external validity, and a test for an efficiency-enhancing reallocation of investment.

A. Investment

Figure 2, panel A plots the time series of mean investment for C-corporations 
and S-corporations in the unbalanced panel, net of a rich set of controls as done in 
Chetty et al. (2011). As is standard in corporate finance, I first scale each corpora-
tion’s annual investment by its lagged tangible capital assets and top-code observa-
tions at the ninety-fifth percentile as described in Section IIE. Then within each year, 
I regress scaled investment on a C-corporation indicator and this paper’s standard 
set of controls: indicators for two-digit NAICS industry classification and quartics 
in age, lagged revenue, lagged profit margin, and revenue growth from the second 
to the first lag.22 I then construct the two series shown in the figure by setting each 
year’s difference between the two lines equal to that year’s regression coefficient 
on the C-corporation indicator and setting the weighted average of that year’s data 
points equal to the year’s sample average. To be concrete, the 2002 C-corporation 
data point indicates that the average C-corporation in 2002 invested  $0.21  per dollar 
of its lagged capital assets, net of controls.

The  figure  shows  that  the  time  series  of  C-corporation  investment  tracked  the 
time  series  of  S-corporation  investment  closely  in  the  several  years  before  2003, 
suggesting that the two time series would have continued to track each other in the 
absence of the 2003 dividend tax cut. The two series in fact continued to track each 
other after 2003, suggesting that the tax cut had little or no effect on C-corporation 
investment.
Table 2 formalizes this visual evidence by reporting estimates of the following 
difference-in-differences (DD)  regression  that  uses  the  same  definitions,  scaling, 
and controls underlying the figure:
(1) 

  INVESTMENT  it    =   α 1     CCORP  i,t−2    +   α 2     CCORP  i,t−2    ×   POST  t    

 

+   X i,t−2   β +   YEAR t  γ  ,

21 In each case, I compute percentiles separately for C-corporations and S-corporations to account for level 
differences  in  the  outcome.  When  I  use  only  the  pre-2003  distribution  to  winsorize,  main  regression  results 
remain nearly unchanged but the payouts effect size is approximately two-thirds as large and still very statistically 
significant. 

22 “Lagged” denotes “averaged over the previous two lags.”

Notes: This table reports difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of the 2003 dividend tax cut on real out-
comes. All columns display the coefficient on the interaction between a C-corporation indicator and an indicator 
for the year being 2003 or later, from a regression of the outcome on this interaction, a C-corporation indicator, 
year fixed effects and possibly additional controls. Lagged controls indicates that the regression includes two-digit 
NAICS industry fixed effects and quartics in age, lagged revenue, lagged profit margin, and revenue growth. Firm 
FE’s indicates that the regression includes firm fixed effects. The unbalanced panel is this paper’s main sample; see 
Table 1 for details. The balanced panel is constructed similarly, except the sample restrictions apply only to years 
1996–1997 and observations are required in all years 1998–2008. Before the regression, each observation’s out-
come value is scaled by either the firm’s tangible capital assets or its revenue (see online Appendix Table 2 for alter-
native scalings) averaged over the two preceding lags in the unbalanced panel and over 1996–1997 in the balanced 
panel, and then winsorized (top-coded) at the level indicated. The regressions are dollar-weighted (each observation 
is weighted by its lagged or 1996–1997 revenue) and they flexibly control for any time-varying industry or firm-
size shocks by non-parametrically reweighting the S-corporation sample within every year to match the distribu-
tion of C-corporations across 190 industry-firm-size bins as detailed in Section IIE. Elasticity equals the reported 
coefficient divided by the pre-2003 C-corporation outcome mean, divided by the percent change in one-minus-the-
top-statutory-dividend-tax-rate (the top rate fell from 44.7 percent to 20.8 percent). Standard errors are clustered by 
firm. See online Appendix Tables 1–7 for robustness checks.

where  INVESTMEN T  it    denotes scaled investment for firm  i  in a year  t  between 1998 
and 2008 and  CCOR P  i, t−2    denotes an indicator for whether firm  i  was a C-corporation 
in  t – 2  ,  POS T  t    denotes an indicator for year  t  being 2003 or later,   X i, t−2    denotes a 
possibly empty vector of lagged firm controls, and  YEA R t    denotes a vector of year 
fixed effects.23 The coefficient   α 2    represents the mean effect of the tax cut on annual 
C-corporation investment and is my statistic of interest. Standard errors clustered by 
firm are reported below each estimate.

Column 2 of Table 2 reports that when controlling for the full set of controls used 
in the graph, the 2003 dividend tax cut is estimated to have had an insignificantly 
negative effect on C-corporation investment: a change of  −$0.0002  per dollar of 
lagged tangible capital assets with a standard error of  $0.0042  , relative to a pre-
2003 mean of  $0.2428  and standard deviation of  $0.2514 . The 2003 dividend tax 
cut reduced the top statutory dividend tax rate from 44.7 percent to 20.8 percent 
(see Section IB), so these estimates imply an elasticity of investment with respect to 
one minus the top statutory dividend tax rate of  0.00  with a 95 percent confidence 
interval of  − 0.08  to  0.08 .24 The confidence interval in terms of standard deviations 
of firm-level investment is  −0.03  to  0.03 . Column 1 reports similar estimates when 
omitting the firm-level controls.

B. Robustness

I  conduct  several  robustness  checks.  First,  columns  4–5  of  Table  2  replicate 
 columns 1–2 when top-coding at the ninety-ninth percentile. Second, online Appendix 
Table 1 replicates Table 2 while allowing for differential pre-2003 trends.25 Third, 
online Appendix Table 2 replicates Table 2 when scaling investment by lagged rev-
enue. Online Appendix Table 3 replicates Table 2, restricted to years 1998–2004 in 
order to omit years in which the controls, scaling variable, and C-corporation indi-
cator use potentially endogenous post-2003 values. All report more negative point 
estimates than Table 2 with similar or smaller 95 percent confidence upper bounds. 
Online Appendix Tables 4 and 5 report results under 14 additional variations to the 
sample frame, variable definition, or reweighting with continued null or marginally 
significantly negative results; see online Appendix C for details.

Additionally, I replicate the analysis in the balanced panel of corporations; this 
sample  comes  at  the  obvious  cost  of  omitting  corporations  that  are  young  in  the 
post-2003  era  and  requiring  survival  through  2008,  but  it  permits  regressions  in 
which the only firm-level characteristic changing from year to year is investment. 
Column 3 of Table 2 reports results from estimating equation (1) in the balanced 
panel, with three changes relative to column 2: each corporation’s C- versus S-status 

23 See  online  Appendix  CII  and  online  Appendix  Table  5  for  similar  results  when  scaling  investment  by

one-minus-the-tax-rate:  (   α ̂   2   /  ‾ investment  )/(0.239/0.553)  , where    ‾ 
24 The elasticity is computed as the percent change in C-corporation investment divided by the percent change in 
investment    equals mean pre-2003 C-corporation 
investment and is reported in Table 2. The elasticity bounds are computed similarly, replacing    α ̂   2    in the above for-
mula with    α ̂   2    plus or minus  1.96  times the standard error.

investment averaged across the post-period, equal in this regression to   α 2   + 2005.5 α 4    since 2005.5 is the midpoint 
of the post-period.

is defined as of 1996, each corporation’s annual investment value is scaled by its 
mean tangible capital assets over years 1996–1997, and I replace the lagged firm-
level controls with firm fixed effects. The resulting estimate has a wider confidence 
interval but is also essentially zero.

Finally, Figure 2, panel B replicates Figure 2, panel A for the related outcome of 
net investment, equal to the real annual dollar change in the corporation’s stock of 
tangible capital assets as reported on the balance sheet. Arithmetically, net invest-
ment equals investment less tangible capital asset retirements and book deprecia-
tion. The figure shows no relative change in C-corporation net investment after the 
2003 tax cut. Columns 7–9 of Table 2 repeat the specifications underlying columns 
1–3 for the net investment outcome. The unbalanced panel point estimates are pos-
itive while the balanced panel point estimate is negative, and none is statistically 
significantly different from zero.26 Online Appendix Tables 1–3 repeat these anal-
yses using the same alternative specifications described above for investment, with 
similar results.

C. Employee Compensation

Figure 2, panel C replicates Figure 2, panel A for the outcome of employee com-
pensation. Each firm’s level of employee compensation is scaled by lagged revenue. 
The figure shows no relative change in C-corporation employee compensation after 
2003.27 Columns 10–12 of Table 2 repeat the specifications underlying columns 1–3 
for the employee compensation outcome. Column 11 lists the results from equation 
(1) using the set of lagged controls. The point estimate is a change of  −$0.0014  per 
dollar of lagged revenue with a standard error of  $0.0020  , relative to a pre-2003 
mean of  $0.1647  and standard deviation of  $0.1415 . This corresponds to an elastic-
ity of  −0.02  with 95 percent confidence interval of  − 0.07  to  0.04 . The confidence 
interval in terms of firm-level standard deviations is  − 0.04  to  0.02 . The balanced 
panel point estimate is positive but is similarly not statistically significantly different 
from zero. Online Appendix Tables 1–3 repeat these analyses using the same alter-
native specifications described above for investment and with similar results.

D. Heterogeneity Analysis

Although  the  above  results  indicate  no  statistically  significant  impact  of  the 
divided tax cut on C-corporation investment, it is possible that this overall result 
obscures a particular spike in investment at, for example, large C-corporations rel-
ative to small C-corporations. To investigate this in a compact way, I estimate six 
triple-difference  regressions,  one  for  each  of  six  prominent  firm-level  traits:  firm 
size (lagged revenue), age, lagged revenue growth, lagged profitability, lagged cash 
(liquid assets as a fraction of total assets), and lagged leverage (debt as a fraction of 
total assets).

26 Elasticity confidence intervals for net investment are larger than those for investment because the base level 

of net investment is close to zero, but standard-deviation confidence intervals are similar. 
27 Note that the downward trend in scaled employee compensation after 2005 is due in part to rising lagged rev-
enue (the scaling variable). Trends are less stable when scaling by tangible capital assets; online Appendix Table 2 
shows that the results are robust to the choice of scaling variable. 

Yagan: Real effects of the 2003 DiviDenD tax cutvol. 105 no. 123550

In  order  to  avoid  strong  parametric  assumptions  such  as  whether  these  traits 
should enter the regressions linearly or in logs, I divide corporations along these 
traits by their ranks. To explain the general procedure, consider the example of firm 
size. I compute the twentieth and eightieth percentiles of firm size in the pooled 
C-corporation distribution, drop all corporations in the middle quintiles (between 
the twentieth and eightieth  percentiles), and define an indicator for each observation 
equal to one if and only if the corporation’s size lies in the top quintile (above the 
eightieth percentile). I then estimate the triple-difference analogue of equation (1):

(2) 
 
 
 

  INVESTMENT  it    =   α 1     CCORP i,t−2    +   α 2     CCORP  i,t−2   ×    POST  t    +   α 3     TRAIT  i,t−2    
+   α 4     CCORP  i,t−2    ×   TRAIT  i,t−2    +   α 5     TRAIT  i,t−2      × POST  t   
+   α 6     CCORP  i,t−2    ×   TRAIT  i,t−2    ×   POST  t    
+   X i,t−2   β +   YEAR t  γ  ,

where  TRAI T  i, t−2    is the top-quintile indicator defined above,   X i, t−2    denotes the vector 
of lagged firm characteristics used in column 2 of Table 2, and all other variables 
retain the definitions used above. The triple-difference coefficient   α 6    represents the 
quantity of interest: the effect of the 2003 dividend tax cut on large C-corporations 
relative to small C-corporations and relative to S-corporations.

Columns 1–3 of Table 3 report the results for investment, net investment, and 
employee compensation. Each cell reports the point estimate of the  triple-difference 
coefficient and its standard error from a separate regression in which the trait indi-
cator is defined using the trait listed in the row heading. For example, the upper 
left cell indicates that large C-corporations increased investment by a statistically 
insignificant  $0.0105  per dollar of lagged tangible capital assets more than small 
C-corporations. All coefficients are small relative to the standard deviation of the 
outcome (displayed in Table 2 columns 2, 8, and 11, respectively) and are statis-
tically insignificant even when not accounting for the large number of hypotheses 
being  tested  simultaneously,  though  with  wider  standard  errors  than  in  the  main 
analysis.

E. Internal Validity

As mentioned in Section IB, a threat to the internal validity of the empirical design 
is that temporary or small contemporaneous changes to other tax policies could in 
principle have increased S-corporation investment relative to C-corporation invest-
ment after 2003, masking positive effects of the dividend tax cut on C-corporation 
investment.  Specifically,  the  2003  tax  reform  accelerated  the  already-legislated 
reduction in the individual ordinary income tax rates from 38.6 percent to 35 per-
cent (which  benefited  S-corporations  relative  to  C-corporations)  and  it  expanded 
temporary accelerated depreciation of investment expenditures (which would have

Notes: This table reports triple-difference estimates of the effect of the 2003 dividend tax cut. Each cell represents a 
separate regression and reports the coefficient on the triple interaction of a C-corporation indicator, an indicator for 
the year being 2003 or later, and an indicator for the firm being in the top quintile rather than the bottom quintile (the 
middle three quintiles are omitted) of the trait specified in the row heading (see Table 1 for definitions). The spec-
ifications underlying each cell of columns 1–3 are identical to the difference-in-differences specifications underly-
ing Table 2 columns 2, 8, and 11, respectively, except that each regression fully interacts the top-quintile indicator 
with the C-corporation and post-2003 indicators. Similar to Table 2, regressions are dollar-weighted (each observa-
tion is weighted by its lagged revenue) and flexibly control for any time-varying industry and firm-size shocks by 
non-parametrically reweighting the S-corporation sample within every year and quintile to match the distribution 
of C-corporations across 190 industry-firm-size bins; the exception is regressions by the lagged-revenue trait which 
can be reweighted only across 19 industry bins since the top and bottom quintiles do not overlap in size. Column 4 
makes the same modifications to the difference-in-difference regression underlying Table 4 column 2. Column 5 
replicates this table’s column 3 for the outcome of equity issued. Standard errors are clustered by firm.

for  full  detail.  First  and  most  simply,  I  conduct  placebo  tests  for  an  increase  in 
S-corporation investment in 2001 and 2002, taking advantage of the fact that the 
reduction  in  individual  ordinary  income  tax  rates  began  in  2001  and  accelerated 
depreciation began in 2002.29 Online Appendix Table 6 columns 2–3 in fact show 
statistically insignificant reductions in S-corporation investment in those years, pro-
viding the simplest evidence suggesting little or no bias.30 Second, column 4 shows 
that controlling flexibly for asset life differences across firms has almost no effect on 
the estimated effect of the dividend tax cut on C-corporation investment, explained 
by C- and S-corporations having nearly identical asset life mixes in this sample. Third 
and most completely, I follow Auerbach and Hassett (1992) and Cohen, Hansen, 
and Hassett (2002) in computing a structural firm-year-specific measure of the cost 
of capital that encompasses the effects of these contemporaneous  non-dividend-tax 

28 It also reduced the top capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 15 percent. The Auerbach-Hassett parameter-

29 In standard models, both the 2001 reduction in individual income tax rates and the 2001-legislated future 

ization below addresses this minor potential confound. 
reductions lowered S-corporations’ cost of capital immediately in 2001 (Auerbach 1989). 

30 This null result can also be seen visually in Figure 2, panel A.

changes. Columns 5–10 show that controlling for this all-in cost-of-capital measure 
again has almost no effect on the results, explained by S-corporations’ cost of cap-
ital falling by similarly modest amounts both before and after 2003. Thus none of 
these varied tests suggests a violation of internal validity.

F. External Validity

The above results are local to the sample and do not necessarily apply to publicly 
traded  corporations  and  to  corporations  that  were  smaller  or  larger  than  the  size 
range  analyzed  here.  I  therefore  conduct  two  additional  analyses  to  test  for  sug-
gestive evidence of different out-of-sample results. First, recall that publicly traded 
corporations were excluded from the main sample because all publicly traded cor-
porations are C-corporations and thus may have no reasonable S-corporation coun-
terparts.  I  nevertheless  repeat  the  regressions  of  Table  2  on  a  broadened  sample 
that includes the 76 percent of publicly traded corporation observations matched to 
tax data that also satisfy this paper’s firm size restrictions. Publicly traded corpora-
tions are large, so these additional observations loom large in these size-weighted 
regressions. Online Appendix Table 7 shows that this inclusion leaves the results of 
Table 2 nearly unchanged.31

In a second test, Figure 3, panels A–C display heterogeneity in the main over-
all  difference-in-differences  effects  on  investment,  net  investment,  and  employee 
compensation, respectively, by firm size decile. The graph is constructed by com-
puting the deciles of the pooled C-corporation distribution of lagged revenue, using 
them  to  divide  all  corporations  into  size  deciles,  estimating  equation (1)  within 
each decile using the full set of lagged controls, and plotting the resulting regres-
sion  coefficients, 95 percent confidence intervals, and the best unweighted linear fit 
through the coefficients.32 The figures reveal three facts: no within-decile estimate 
is statistically significantly different from zero, each graph’s cross-decile variance 
in point estimates is small relative to the standard deviation, and there is no upward 
or  downward  trend  in  any  graph’s  point  estimates.  Hence  if  one  were  to  extrap-
olate from these results, one would predict that the 2003 dividend tax cut had no 
real effects on C-corporations outside of this paper’s size range. However, further 
research is necessary to support out-of-sample conclusions.

G. Potential Reallocation of Investment

The central question of this paper is whether the 2003 dividend tax cut increased 
the level of corporate investment and employee compensation. This section has found 
no detectable increase in these levels. I now briefly investigate the separate ques-
tion of whether there is evidence to suggest that the dividend tax cut improved the 
allocative efficiency of investment, even if it did not increase its overall level. This 

31 Online Appendix Table 4, column 5 shows a more negative result when including all public corporations 

regardless of size. 
32 Each graph’s y-axis is centered at zero and has total height equal to one standard deviation of the outcome 
used in the regression (reported in columns 2, 8, and 11 of Table 2). Each confidence interval is Bonferroni-adjusted 
for the fact that each graph tests multiple (ten) hypotheses; each interval would be 30 percent tighter if unadjusted 
(i.e., the  t -statistic threshold for statistical significance at the 5 percent level is 2.81 rather than 1.96).

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWdECEMbER 20153553

possibility is motivated by a recent theoretical contribution (Chetty and Saez 2010, 
building on Shleifer and Vishny 1986) that argues that a dividend tax cut can reduce 
wasteful investment at some C-corporations (as shareholders improve monitoring 
and force managers to reduce wasteful investment spending) while increasing pro-
ductive investment at other C-corporations (via the traditional cost-of-capital chan-
nel described below in Section VA), consistent with Swedish evidence (Alstadsæter, 
Jacob, and Michaely 2014). Among other predictions, this agency theory predicts 
that the subgroups of C-corporations that increased total payouts to shareholders 
the least are also the ones that most increased equity issuance.33 Columns 4–5 of 
Table 3 repeat the heterogeneity analysis of Section IIID for the outcomes of pay-
outs and equity issuance. The results are noisy but no negative relationship is appar-
ent between equity issuance and payouts when comparing coefficients across the 
columns. Hence, I do not find evidence in support of investment rebalancing across 
C-corporation subgroups.34

IV.  Confirmation of Salience and Relevance

The previous section documented robust zero effects of the 2003 dividend tax cut 
on C-corporation investment and employee compensation. Whenever an interven-
tion is found to have had no significant impact, an important concern for interpre-
tation is that perhaps the intervention was simply not salient or relevant. A lack of 
salience is perhaps unlikely given the prominence and size of the 2003 dividend tax 
cut; more plausible is that unknown tax provisions neutralized the actual applica-
bility of the tax cut. The dividend tax is assessed on dividend income, so I now test 
for an immediate impact of the dividend tax cut on dividends and on total payouts to 
shareholders (dividends plus share buybacks).
I focus on total payouts in the text and report the very similar dividend results in 
the online Appendix in order to allow the main results to speak to the unresolved 
academic debate on the effects of the 2003 dividend tax cut on total payouts. Chetty 
and Saez (2005) showed that the tax cut increased the dividends of publicly traded 
corporations.  However,  subsequent  papers  have  questioned  the  relevance  of  this 
behavior by arguing that planned buybacks may have simply been relabeled as div-
idends,  leaving  total  payouts  unchanged (Blouin,  Raedy,  and  Shackelford  2011; 
Brown, Liang, and Weisbenner 2007; Edgerton 2013).
A. Effect on Payouts

Figure  2,  panel  D  plots  the  time  series  of  mean  payouts  to  shareholders  from 
C-corporations and S-corporations in the unbalanced panel. Each corporation’s pay-
outs value is scaled by its lagged revenue in the spirit of Lintner (1956), though 
results are robust to this choice. The figure is then constructed exactly as in Figure 3, 
panels A–C except for two differences. Because C-corporations pay taxes on annual 

33 Reduced  wasteful  investment  results  in  increased  payouts;  increased  productive  investment  is  funded  by 

increased equity issuance. 

34 Public corporations have much more dispersed ownership and thus may be more prone to agency problems 

than this paper’s private corporations. 

Yagan: Real effects of the 2003 DiviDenD tax cutvol. 105 no. 123554

 corporate income at the entity level while S-corporation shareholders are liable for 
them at the shareholder level, S-corporations often pay higher levels of dividends 
(approximately ten times larger on average than C-corporations) to help sharehold-
ers cover these tax liabilities. Thus I account for level differences in pre-2003 scaled 
payouts by dividing firm  i ’s scaled payouts in year  t  by the mean level of payouts 
for  i ’s corporate type (C or S) in the pre-2003 period, essentially transforming the 
comparison into percentage terms.35 Second, I account for slightly differential pre-
trends by de-trending each series; I show below that the main qualitative result does 
not  depend  on  de-trending.36  To  be  concrete,  the  2002  C-corporation  data  point 
means that the average C-corporation in 2002 paid out  0.34  cents per dollar of its 
lagged revenue, net of controls.

The  figure  shows  that  C-corporation  and  S-corporation  payouts  tracked  each 
other in the five years before 2003, suggesting that in the absence of a tax change the 
two series would have continued to track each other after 2003. Then  immediately 
after the dividend tax cut, C-corporation payouts spiked by  20 percent  relative to 
S-corporation payouts and relative to the 2002 difference, and remained elevated 
above S-corporation payouts through the end of the sample.

The first row of Table 4 columns 1–3 formalizes this visual evidence by replicat-
ing columns 1–3 of Table 2 for the scaled payouts outcome; Table 4 columns 4–6 
report estimates for analogous regressions that allow for differential pre-2003 trends 
(see footnote 25). To test for a statistically significant increase immediately in 2003, 
each column also reports coefficients from a separate regression that is analogous 
to the main specification (1) except that it replaces the post-period indicators with 
indicators for each post-period year. That is, I estimate

(3) 
 

 PAYOUT S  it   =  α 1  CCOR P  i, t−2   +  X i, t−2  β +  YEAR t  γ 

+ CCOR P i, t−2   × YEA R i, t  δ  ,

where  CCOR P i, t−2   × YEA R it    is a vector of six indicators for each year  T ∈ { 2003  ,  
2004  ,  2005  ,  2006  ,  2007  ,  2008}  , each equal to one if and only if  t =  T  and corpo-
ration   i   was  a  C-corporation  in  year   t – 2 .37  The  coefficient  vector   δ   contains  the 
coefficients of interest: the effect of the tax cut on C-corporation payouts from the 
pre-period  to  each  post-period  year,  net  of  the  change  in  S-corporation  payouts. 
For brevity, Table 4 reports only the estimates I refer to in the main text; see online 
Appendix  Tables  8  and  9  for  full  results  for  the  payouts  outcome  and  the  divi-
dends-only outcome, respectively.

35 C  and  S-corporation  payouts  may  be  expected  a  priori  to  track  each  other  in  percentage  terms  because 
S-corporation income tax liabilities are approximately a flat percentage of income, and a corporate finance tradition 
conceives of firms paying out a set fraction of after-tax earnings (Lintner). 
36 The C-corporation series has a slightly steeper downward trend, consistent with the well-documented twen-
ty-year decline in dividend payments (Chetty and Saez 2005), combined with the fact that S-corporation dividends 
include payouts intended to cover tax payments that need not have been in secular decline. 
37 Columns  4–6  of  Table  4  report  estimates  when  an  additional  term— CCOR P  i, t−2   × t —is  included  in  the 

regression in order to allow for differential pre-trends.

outs to shareholders (dividends plus buybacks). The first row of columns 1–3 use the same specifications, controls, 
scaling, weights underlying Table 2 columns 10–12 except that before the winsorizing and in order to account for 
large level differences in pre-2003 payouts (see Table 1 and the y-axis of Figure 2, panel D), each firm i’s pay-
outs in year  t  is divided by the mean level of payouts for  i ’s corporate type (C or S) in the pre-2003 period, essen-
tially transforming the comparison into percentage terms. The second through fourth rows of each column report

Across all specifications and samples, I find a large and statistically significant 
effect on C-corporation payouts. Column 2 reports that in the unbalanced panel with 
the full set of controls, I estimate that the dividend tax cut caused an immediate  21.5 
percent  increase in C-corporation payouts in 2003, with a  t -statistic over  5  ,  implying 
an  elasticity  of  payouts  with  respect  to  one  minus  the  top  statutory  dividend  tax 
rate of  0.50  (reported in online Appendix Table 8). The remaining columns report 
similar or larger estimates when considering all years, when de-trending, and in the 
balanced panel. Online Appendix Table 9 reports similar estimates for the outcome 
of dividends only. I conclude that the 2003 dividend tax cut was immediately salient 
and relevant to C-corporations.

B. Compatibility of the Payouts and Investment Results

Standard models of dividend taxation abstract from cash and debt and assume 
that  every  dollar  of  increased  payouts  substitutes  for  a  dollar  of  investment;  the 
significant payouts effect may therefore appear at first glance incompatible with the 
null investment result. However, the payouts effect was large in percentage terms 
but small in dollar terms relative to all other balance sheet flows and the investment 
effect’s  standard  error,  so  the  results  are  consistent  with  a  small  dollar-for-dollar 
reduction  in  investment,  or  with  a  mere  reshuffling  of  corporate  financial  claims 

Yagan: Real effects of the 2003 DiviDenD tax cutvol. 105 no. 123556

(e.g., a little less cash or a little more debt) and no reduction in investment.38 The 
main relevance of the payouts result for this paper is that it validates the empirical 
design and salience.

V.  Economic Interpretation and Policy Implications

The previous sections documented that the 2003 dividend tax cut was immedi-
ately salient and relevant but had no detectable impact on investment or employee 
compensation. This section considers reasons for the null investment result and asks 
under what circumstances would future dividend tax cuts be expected to have large 
and positive real effects. I begin by noting that a near-zero dividend tax elasticity 
of investment implies either a small dividend tax elasticity of firms’ cost of capital, 
or a small cost-of-capital elasticity of investment, or both. I then detail whether and 
why either elasticity would likely have been small and the implications for the real 
effects of future alternative dividend tax reforms. The section ends with a discussion 
of the payouts response.

A. Economic Interpretation

The prediction that a dividend tax cut can substantially increase investment derives 
from models that are referred to as representing the “traditional view” (Harberger 
1962, 1966; Feldstein 1970; Poterba and Summers 1985). Traditional-view models 
feature  permanent  dividend  tax  cuts  and  firms  that  finance  marginal  investments 
with newly issued equity.39 A dividend tax cut reduces firms’ cost of capital—the 
pretax rate of return required on marginal investments—because it reduces the taxes 
that must be paid when profits are distributed to shareholders; this induces firms to 
raise new investment funds and increase investment.40
I now derive a quantitative traditional-view prediction for the elasticity of invest-
ment with respect to one minus the dividend tax rate (“the dividend tax elasticity 
of investment”). I do so by multiplying a traditional-view parameterization of the 
elasticity of the cost of capital with respect to one minus the dividend tax rate (“the 
dividend tax elasticity of the cost of capital”) by empirical estimates of the elasticity 
of investment with respect to the cost of capital (“the cost-of-capital elasticity of 
investment”).
Desai  and  Goolsbee  (2004)  parameterize  the  workhorse  traditional  model 
(Poterba and Summers 1985) as follows. A C-corporation faces a cost of capital 
equal to

 

r  ___________________________    (1 −  τ inc  ) [(1 −  τ div  )p + (1 −  τ acg  )(1 − p)]     ,
   

38 The standard error on the investment effect (Table 2, column 2) implies a 95 percent upper bound reduction 
in investment of  $87,557  per C-corporation, while the payouts response (Table 4, column 2) implies a payouts 
increase of  $59,922  per C-corporation. 
39 Similar qualitative predictions obtain when firms finance investment with risky debt, since debt holders often 
become equity holders after bankruptcy reorganization. Dai et al. (2013) formulate a related argument based on 
financing constraints with similar predictions. 
40 In terms of Tobin’s  q ,  q  always equals  1  under the traditional view: the marginal dollar invested within the 
firm generates the same after-tax return as outside options, and investment must rise after a dividend tax cut in order 
to maintain  q =  1 . 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWdECEMbER 20153557

where  r  is the economy’s rate of time preference,   τ inc    is the corporate income tax 
rate,   τ div    is the tax rate applied to dividends and other payouts,41  p  is the share of 
earnings paid out rather than retained, and   τ acg    is the effective tax rate on accrued 
capital gains.42 The effective tax rate on accrued capital gains represents a combina-
tion of future payouts (taxed at   τ div   ), future realized capital gains (taxed at the statu-
tory capital gains tax rate), and bequests (taxed at the estate tax rate). Based on their 
reading of the literature, Desai and Goolsbee assume a payouts share of earnings 
equal to  0.5  and an effective tax rate on accrued capital gains equal to one-quarter 
of the top statutory rate.43 Combining these parameters with the decrease in the top 
statutory dividend tax rate from 44.7 percent to 20.8 percent yields an elasticity of 
the cost of capital with respect to one minus the payout tax rate of  −0.411 . Hassett 
and Hubbard (2002) summarize the recent empirical literature as reaching a consen-
sus range for the cost-of-capital elasticity of investment of  −0.5  to  −1.0 .44
Multiplying these elasticities together, one obtains a predicted range of the divi-
dend tax elasticity of investment of  0.21  to  0.41 . These predicted elasticities are 2.5 to 
5 times as large as this paper’s estimated 95 percent confidence upper bound ( 0.08 ). 
Hence, either the consensus range for the cost-of-capital elasticity of  investment or 
the parameterized tax elasticity of the cost of capital, or both, failed to materialize.
There is no obvious reason to believe that corporations would have been unusu-
ally unresponsive to cost-of-capital changes in the 2003–2008 time period. Fixed 
costs  to  capital  stock  adjustment  can  temporarily  mute  investment  responses  to 
 cost-of-capital  changes (Caballero,  Engel,  and  Haltiwanger  1995),  but  the  2003 
dividend  tax  cut  was  passed  at  the  end  of  a  cyclical  downturn  in  investment,  so 
corporations are unlikely to have been particularly far from any positive investment 
thresholds. The short-run supply of capital assets may be inelastic (Goolsbee 1998), 
but this cannot explain the lack of a relative change (between C- and S-corporations) 
in investment expenditures (price times quantity, not just quantity).
There are at least three reasons that the true cost-of-capital elasticity of invest-
ment may be smaller than the Hassett-Hubbard consensus range. First, a large time 
series literature dating back to Eisner’s (1969, 1970) responses to Hall and Jorgenson 
(1967) finds small cost-of-capital elasticities of investment, and the newer estimates 
that  underlie  the  modern  consensus  range  employ  reasonable  but  difficult-to-ver-
ify structural assumptions (e.g., Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger 1995). Second, 
these  newer  estimates  may  reflect  intertemporal  substitution  over  short  horizons 
(c.f.  Caballero  1994  and  Cummins,  Hassett,  and  Hubbard  1994)  or  relaxation  of 
financing constraints (e.g., Zwick and Mahon 2014) that would apply, for example, 

41 Most private C-corporation payouts are taxed at the dividend tax rate; see footnote 13. 
42 Poterba and Summers allow  r  to depend negatively on  p  so that the required rate of return is lower for cor-
porations that pay dividends, e.g., because regular dividends may have signaling value. Dividend-paying private 
corporations tend to pay dividends frequently but in irregular amounts so I ignore this dependency here. 

43 The top statutory capital gains rate equals approximately the top dividend tax rate of 20.8 percent; it is quan-

titatively irrelevant whether one uses this value or a five-percentage-points-higher pre-2003 rate. 
44 The investment time horizon that these estimates are based on varies but a two-year-or-shorter horizon is 
common (e.g., Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard 1994 and Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger 1995). Note that in 
the very long run after adjustment to a new steady-state capital stock, measured elasticities of investment scaled by 
lagged tangible capital will be zero, but recall that this paper’s results hold even when scaling investment by pre-
2003 tangible capital (see online Appendix CII and online Appendix Table 5). 

Yagan: Real effects of the 2003 DiviDenD tax cutvol. 105 no. 123558

to temporary accelerated depreciation but likely not to a dividend tax cut.45 Third, 
there may be publication bias toward statistically significant empirical results (Card 
and Krueger 1995) and such bias could have led to the publication of erroneously 
large estimates.
Because this paper is fundamentally concerned with the effects of the dividend 
tax cut, I proceed by taking as given the Hassett-Hubbard consensus range for the 
cost-of-capital elasticity of investment and turning to why the dividend tax elasticity 
of the cost of capital could have been small and the implications for the real effects 
of future alternative dividend tax cuts.

B. Policy Implications of a Small Cost-of-Capital Change

Explanations  for  why  the  large  2003  dividend  tax  cut  could  have  caused  a 
small  reduction  in  the  cost  of  capital  fall  into  either  of  two  lines  of  reasoning: 
traditional-view models are the wrong models, or traditional-view models are cor-
rect but the above parameterization is wrong. Each line of reasoning clarifies the 
circumstances under which future dividend tax cuts would be expected to substan-
tially increase investment

Wrong Model.—The leading alternative to the traditional view—called the “new 
view” (also called the “trapped equity view”; King 1977; Auerbach 1979; Bradford 
1981)—can explain the null result on investment. New-view models feature firms 
with profits from preexisting operations that are abundant enough to fund all prof-
itable investment.46 Because those preexisting profits will  inevitably be  subject to 
dividend taxes (whether paid out immediately, or retained for investment and paid 
out  in  the  future),  a  permanent  dividend  tax  cut  increases  the  post-tax  return  on 
investment by the same factor that it increases the opportunity cost of investment.47 
Thus the new view predicts that a permanent dividend tax cut affects firm value but 
does not affect the cost of capital and does not affect corporate investment.48

The policy implication of the new view is that dividend tax cuts typically do not 
reduce firms’ cost of capital and thus are typically not useful tools for increasing 
investment. The exception would be if a dividend tax cut today signaled that div-
idend tax rates would fall even further in the future. This is possible, though the 

45 In other words, cost-of-capital formulas could be misspecified in the sense that a unit reduction in the cost 
of capital due to temporary accelerated depreciation affects investment more than a unit reduction due to other tax 
changes.

46 Access to riskless debt generates similar results because interest payments are not subject to dividend taxes. 
47 To see this in a simple riskless two-period setup in which all profits in the second period are paid out as dividends, 
consider a new-view firm in a small-open economy that begins the first period with abundant past profits. It chooses 
how much to retain for investment (equal to past profits minus dividend payouts) by equating the return on marginal 
investment  to  the  opportunity  cost  of  that  investment:    (1 −  τ DIV  )   (1 −  τ INC  )  f ′ (PASTPROFITS − PAYOUTS)  =  
(1 −  τ DIV  )  r  , where   τ DIV    is the dividend tax rate,   τ INC    is the business income tax rate,  f ′( · )  is a concave gross profit 

function, and  r  is the fixed return available on outside investments. A reduction in the dividend tax rate increases 
both sides of the equation by the same factor, inducing no change in optimal investment. In terms of Tobin’s  q ,  q  is 
less than 1 in the new view by an amount that varies proportionally with one minus the dividend tax rate. 
48 An anticipated dividend tax cut would induce an increase in investment before the tax cut, which Figure 
2, panel A suggests did not happen. See Poterba and Summers (1985); Ayers, Cloyd, and Robinson (2002); and 
Auerbach and Hassett (2007) for evidence of effects on firm value. 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWdECEMbER 20153559

policy debate since 2003 has centered on keeping top dividend tax rates constant or 
increasing them.49
Of course, even if the new view characterizes most firms, the traditional view 
may characterize other firms (Auerbach and Hassett 2003; Dhaliwal et al. 2005), 
especially  start-ups  that  may  be  particularly  reliant  on  external  equity  financing. 
This paper’s main analysis sample contains many start-ups, but most firms are not 
young: the median firm age studied here is 22 years, and only 1 of the 100 most 
valuable publicly traded companies in the United States was founded since 2003.50 
The implication would be that the effect of dividend tax cuts on the US capital stock 
may grow large as start-ups (traditional-view firms) gradually replace mature (new-
view) firms over the very long run, but the near-term effect may be small because 
mature firms dominate US production.

Wrong  Parameterization.—An  alternative  explanation  of  the  null  investment 
result is that the traditional view correctly models firms’ investment decisions and 
that alternative dividend tax cuts can substantially reduce firms’ cost of capital and 
thereby increase investment, even if the 2003 dividend tax cut in this sample did not. 
There are at least three distinct versions of this explanation. Considered together, the 
implication is that it may be difficult for policymakers to implement an alternative 
dividend tax cut that has substantially larger near-term effects.

First, the returns to new investment can take years to accrue in the form of higher 
profits that can be paid out to shareholders, and a dividend tax cut reduces the cost 
of capital for new investment only insofar as those payouts will be taxed at the new 
low rate. The 2003 dividend tax cut originally carried an expiration date of 2009 
before being extended to 2013 and then being made permanent at nearly the full rate 
reduction (see Section IB). It is therefore possible that a dividend tax cut with no 
initial default expiration date would have substantially reduced the cost of capital, 
even if the 2003 dividend tax cut did not.51 In this case, modern democracies may 
be unable to guarantee the permanence necessary for a dividend tax cut to substan-
tially reduce firms’ cost of capital and thus increase investment. For example, the 
Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent in 
1988 with no default expiration date, but the rate was subsequently raised to 39.6 
percent in 1993. Looking globally, a majority of the G7 economies (Japan, Italy, the 
United States, and the United Kingdom) have substantially raised or lowered their 
top dividend tax rates since 2003.52
Second  and  despite  stock  price  evidence  that  the  tax  cut  was  unanticipated 
(Auerbach and Hassett 2007), perhaps C-corporations had been expecting to enjoy 
low  dividend  taxes  at  some  point  in  the  future  and  thus  had  been  investing  at  a

50 Inference on start-ups is also challenging because the counterfactual (e.g., perhaps not founding the company

in the first place) may be difficult to discern. 
tax rate was too large. 
52 Japan lowered its top rate from 43.6 percent to 10 percent; Italy raised its top rate from 12.5 percent to 20 
percent; and the UK raised its top rate from 25 percent to 36 percent (OECD 2012). These figures include average 
subnational top rates.

 permanently higher rate even before the tax cut.53 Under this candidate explanation, 
a future dividend tax cut would increase investment only if its magnitude exceeded 
expectations or if it increased expectations of future cuts.

Third and although substantial corporate profits are subject to dividend taxation—
about $300 billion in 2008 and similar in magnitude to total taxable capital gains—it 
is  possible  that  most  profits  from  private  C-corporations  escape  dividend  taxation 
and are instead taxed as capital gains in corporate acquisitions, as bequests subject to 
the estate tax, or not at all through various capital income exclusions.54 This would 
imply that a future dividend tax cut could substantially increase near-term invest-
ment if the dividend tax base were substantially broadened, such as by lowering the 
dividend tax rate relative to the capital gains tax rate. However, there may be polit-
ical impediments to doing so: US policymakers have historically kept tax rates on 
taxable dividend income weakly greater than those on taxable capital gains, perhaps 
because most Americans hold small portions of their assets in stocks relative to hous-
ing (Campbell 2006) and may be more receptive to low tax rates on capital gains.55

C. The Payouts Response

This paper shows that the 2003 dividend tax cut increased total corporate pay-
outs. This increase was small in dollar terms and may have been irrelevant for real 
 outcomes (see  Section  IVB),  but  the  effect  is  relevant  for  the  study  of  corporate 
finance  and  I  now  discuss  its  potential  drivers  and  outline  directions  for  future 
research.

Traditional-view  models  do  not  explain  the  payouts  response.56  A  new-view 
explanation of the payouts response is that firms viewed the tax cut as temporary 
and thus engaged in intertemporal tax arbitrage by distributing payouts before tax 
rates rise (Korinek and Stiglitz 2009). The time series of payouts provide one rea-
son to doubt this mechanism: Figure 2, panel D and Table 4 suggest that payouts 
did not decline substantially after 2004 when President Bush won reelection and 
his party won control of both houses of Congress, which likely reduced expecta-
tions of a near-term rise in dividend taxes and hence incentives for immediate tax 
arbitrage (Korinek  and  Stiglitz  2009).57  However,  this  is  not  conclusive  because 
expectations are not observable, because various concerns may govern the timing 
of  tax-arbitraging payouts, and because of sampling and specification uncertainty. 

53 That is, with respect to the parameterization, perhaps the assumed tax change was again too large. 
54 That is, with respect to the parameterization, perhaps the assumed value of  p  was too large. Payouts can 
escape taxes if they are distributed in the form of bequested corporate equity below the estate tax threshold, if the 
corporate stock is held in tax-favored investment accounts or by untaxed entities like pension funds (though this is 
unlikely for most private corporations), or if private C-corporations preparing to distribute earnings manage to meet 
S-status requirements and switch tax status (though switching is relatively rare). 
55 All  forms  of  capital  income  accrue  very  disproportionately  to  high-income  Americans,  but  Republican 
lawmakers  in  2003  explained  that  in  contrast  to  cutting  dividend  taxes,  “millions  of Americans  understand  the 
power of cutting the tax on capital gains” making low capital gains tax rates “easier to sell” (David Firestone, “As 
Bush Tax Plan Falters, Conservatives Find a Silver Lining,” New York Times, May 8, 2003, http://www.nytimes.
com/2003/05/08/us/as-bush-tax-plan-falters-conservatives-find-a-silver-lining.html). 
56 The exception is the traditional-view model of Poterba and Summers (1985) which allows for a dividend tax 
cut to immediately increase payouts (and investment) when payouts such as regular dividends carry signaling value. 
This is unlikely to be relevant for the private corporations studied here. 
57 The  2004  Democratic  presidential  challenger,  John  Kerry,  pledged  to  repeal  the  tax  cut  for  high-income 
Americans and at one point was the front runner according to betting markets (Auerbach and Hassett 2007). 

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEWdECEMbER 20153561

Chetty and Saez (2010) show that the new view can explain the payouts increase as 
a permanent dividend tax cut causing dispersed shareholders to incur the monitoring 
costs necessary to prevent wasteful investment by managers. This too is possible, 
though such agency problems would be expected to be least severe among private 
corporations, whose shareholders are typically concentrated.
Three under-emphasized mechanisms may instead explain the payouts response. 
First, the dividend tax cut raised the value of C-corporation equity (Auerbach and 
Hassett 2007), so owners of illiquid private C-corporation stock may have increased 
payouts in order to rebalance their portfolios or to reoptimize consumption among 
themselves and their heirs. Second, the dividend tax cut could have induced con-
trolling owners to use payouts for their own liquidity, against the interests of minority 
shareholders and similar to tunneling (Johnson et al. 2000). Third, high dividend 
tax  rates  incent  owner-managers  to  avoid  or  evade  taxes  by  paying  out  earnings 
as officer compensation or purchasing consumption goods through the corporation 
(Gordon and Slemrod 2000); the tax cut reduced the benefits of such behavior and 
may have caused C-corporations to increase formally-labeled payouts. These effects 
are observationally equivalent in the data available to me, but testing among these 
various mechanisms is an interesting area for future research.

VI.  Conclusion

The 2003 dividend tax cut was one of the largest changes ever to a US capital 
income tax rate and was intended to increase corporate investment and labor utiliza-
tion, beginning in the near term. This paper used a large sample of tax returns from 
large private corporations—some subject to dividend taxation (C-corporations) and 
others not (S-corporations)—to test whether these real goals were achieved in a firm 
size range that employs most US private sector workers. I estimate that the tax cut 
caused no change in C-corporation investment or employee compensation relative 
to S-corporations. Evidence of an immediate increase in payouts confirms salience 
and relevance. External validity remains an open question, but neither broadening 
the sample to include publicly traded corporations nor heterogeneity by firm size 
suggests different out-of-sample results.

The findings contrast with evidence of large real effects of numerous other fiscal 
policies. Economically, the null result implies either that the dividend tax cut had 
little effect on firms’ cost of capital, or that investment responded to cost-of-capital 
changes substantially less than recent evidence would have predicted, or both. The 
tax cut could have failed to reduce the cost of capital either because marginal invest-
ments are funded out of retained earnings and riskless debt as in “new-view” models 
of  dividend  taxation (King  1977; Auerbach  1979;  Bradford  1981)  or  because  of 
particular features of the tax regime. Each potential mechanism suggests that it may 
be difficult for policymakers to implement an alternative dividend tax cut that has 
substantially larger near-term effects.
