While signiﬁcant work has been done to examine the determinants of regional development, there is lit-
tle evidence on the role of air services. This paper exploits the large and swift changes to air trafﬁc
induced by the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act to identify the link between air trafﬁc and local economic
growth. Using data for 263 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) over a two-decade time period, we esti-
mate the effects of airline trafﬁc on local population, income, and employment growth. Our most conser-
vative estimates suggest that a 50-percent increase in an average city’s air trafﬁc growth rate generates
an additional stream of income over a 20-year period equal to 7.4 percent of real GDP, the equivalent of
$523.3 million in 1978 dollars.

1. Introduction

Almost since the invention of the airplane, policymakers at all
levels of government have spent considerable resources to pro-
mote air services for their constituents. Currently in the United
States, local airports and communities are quite active in providing
subsidies and pledging future travel tickets in order to encourage
airlines to add new routes for their region (e.g., Tampa2), or to deter

them from terminating strategic routes (e.g., Portland3), or from
downgrading a city from its hub status (e.g., Cleveland4). A 2009 sur-
vey by Airports Council International North America found that of
the 52 responding airports, 33 had incentive agreements involving
domestic air service, and 23 airports had incentive agreements for
international air service.5

The universal justiﬁcation for these government policies is the
stated belief that air services are crucial for regional economic
growth. In support of this belief there is anecdotal evidence sug-
gesting that air transport improves business operations by provid-
ing quick access to input supplies, it stimulates innovation by
facilitating face-to-face meetings, and overall
it represents an
essential input to the activity of many industries. However, it is
not clear how much local economies signiﬁcantly rely on air ser-
vices, nor the extent to which other modes of transportation and
communication can be easily used as substitute. In the end, a posi-
tive correlation between air services and economic growth may
make policymakers erroneously believe that there is a causal

relationship that they can affect, when other factors out of their
control could be driving the positive correlation.

Estimating the economic beneﬁts of transportation projects in
general, and of air services in particular, is difﬁcult because there
is a strong interdependence between the provision of such services
and regional growth. Communities that beneﬁt from more rapid
economic growth tend to also invest more in infrastructure, and
in the provision of transportation services. In turn, the availability
of reliable transportation services further stimulates regional
development.

Perhaps due to the difﬁculty of identiﬁcation, there are only a
couple prior studies examining the effect of air service on regional
growth. Brueckner (2003) estimates the effect of airline trafﬁc on
employment using cross-sectional data at the Metropolitan Statis-
tical Area (MSA) level, and ﬁnds that a 10 percent increase in pas-
senger enplanements leads to an approximately 1 percent increase
in MSA employment, with service sectors responsible for most of
the effect. Brueckner (2003) uses hub status of an airport, the
MSA’s centrality within the U.S., and its proximity to the nearest
large metropolitan area to instrument for the endogeneity of the
level of air transport services. However, hub status may be endoge-
nous with current and expected growth of an MSA, while geo-
graphic factors may affect general economic growth of a region
just as much as air services.6 Green (2007) estimates the effect of
air transport on regional growth. Using information on 83 MSAs,
he regresses air passenger trafﬁc levels in 1990 on subsequent
decennial population and employment growth, and ﬁnds that a 10
percent increase in boardings per capita generates a 3.9 percent
higher population growth and 2.8 percent higher employment
growth for the period 1990–2000. However, economic outcomes
such as population, employment, and even air services are persistent

6 There is a signiﬁcant economic geography literature showing how spatial location
inﬂuences regional development and income growth via market access effects. See,
for example, Redding and Venables (2004) for a cross-country analysis, or Hanson
(2005) and Head and Mayer (2006) for a regional analysis.

processes. This too makes identiﬁcation difﬁcult in the absence of a
major exogenous and long-lasting shock to the airline service.

In this paper we present an alternative way to identify the rela-
tionship between air services and regional economic growth,
which relies on time series variation. We exploit a quasi-natural
experiment that stems from the dramatic changes in the aviation
industry following the 1978 U.S. Airline Deregulation Act.7 In just
a few years following the legislation, the industry was rapidly
deregulated, transitioning from an environment of tight policy
restrictions to free market. This transformation was accompanied
by large changes in air services across cities to unwind the artiﬁcial
constraints imposed under regulation. These constraints included a
regulatory regime that had stopped approving new routes since
the early 1970s, and that had explicitly subsidized air service to
small and medium communities in the U.S. at the expense of larger
cities.8 To illustrate the relevance and impact of the policy, Fig. 1
illustrates the relative changes in air services across city size groups
in the wake of deregulation around the phase-in years 1977–1983.
The simple snapshot of the raw data suggests that the 1978 aviation
deregulation led to sizable, long-lasting and heterogeneous effects
on the provision of aviation services across urban locations.

Using historical data on economic and aviation indicators for 263
MSAs spanning the period 1969–1991, we exploit the signiﬁcant
changes in passenger aviation triggered by industry deregulation
in order to infer the effect of air services on regional growth.9 We

7 Using the German division and reuniﬁcation as a natural experiment, Redding
et al. (2011) provide interesting evidence for how persistent the shocks to the aviation
network can be, in large part due to the presence of sunk costs and network
externalities.

8 The only major form of regulation in the industry that remained was the Essential
Air Service program, which mandated service to very small communities. This
program has been quite limited in the communities it covers, and currently provides
services to approximately 3000 passengers a day.

9 Technically, the unit of observation in our dataset is a Core Based Statistical Area
(CBSA), which includes both micropolitan and metropolitan statistical areas. How-
ever, since 75 percent of the cities in our sample are metropolitan statistical areas,
throughout the paper we will be using the abbreviation MSA to refer to cities in our
sample.

take advantage of the variation in the growth of air trafﬁc before ver-
sus after the policy change, and employ a difference-in-differences
framework. Given the artiﬁcial distortions swiftly unwound by
deregulation, it is plausible that these deviations in air passenger
changes over time were unrelated to urban growth patterns. If so,
then an OLS estimation methodology would be sufﬁcient to causally
identify the effect of air passenger service on regional growth.

However, we take a number of additional measures to purge
our results of any remaining endogeneity concerns. First, we esti-
mate our difference-in-differences framework on already differ-
enced data (i.e., variables expressed as average annual growth
rates), so that we identify our effects from deviations in growth
paths.10 Second, we control for location-speciﬁc secular trends, as
well as for joint determinants of air trafﬁc and urban growth via city
ﬁxed effects and control variables for initial period economic condi-
tions. Third, we are only identifying our effects from changes in air
passenger trafﬁc that occurred in a relatively short time window fol-
lowing deregulation (i.e., 1977–1983). Longer time frames would
mix these one-time deregulatory changes with ongoing air passen-
ger changes that are made in response to current and expected
future regional growth trends.

While we believe that these strategies largely eliminate endo-
geneity concerns, we also employ instrumental variables methods
in tandem with our difference-in-differences framework. We
explore a number of alternative instruments to isolate the exoge-
nous component of the change in the growth of air trafﬁc that
occurred in the wake of deregulation. First, we instrument the
deviation in a city’s air trafﬁc growth with the average deviation
in air trafﬁc growth among cities within the same size category
as the city in question. Second, we use information only on ‘‘neigh-
boring’’ cities to construct the average change in air trafﬁc growth
triggered by deregulation, and explore a number of alternative
deﬁnitions of what constitutes a neighboring city.

Our analysis provides evidence for a direct effect of air services
on regional development that is robust to these many strategies for
identifying this relationship. We ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant and
positive estimates across the OLS and across the IV estimates. For
a given city, a 50 percent increase in the growth rate of air passen-
ger trafﬁc (a relatively small change in our sample11) leads, on aver-
age, to an increase in the annual population growth rate ranging
between 1.55 and 4.2 percent. To put this result in perspective, this
corresponds to an additional 0.42–1.14 percent increase in the
population level of the average city after a 20-year period. In the
same manner, we ﬁnd that a 50 percent increase in a city’s air trafﬁc
growth rate leads to between 1.65 and 3.45 percent increase in the
annual income growth rate (which corresponds to an additional
0.6–1.20 percent increase in the level of per-capita income after a
20-year period), and to 2.7–4.7 percent increase in the annual
employment growth rate (which corresponds to an additional 1.6–
5.7 percent increase in total employment after a two-decade period)
on average. When estimating the employment effects by sector, we
ﬁnd that services and retail industries are the ones experiencing

10 This strategy follows the ‘‘difference of differences’’ approach pursued by Treﬂer
(2004).
11 There is a lot of variation across communities in the change in air trafﬁc growth
rates pre- versus post-deregulation. Rather than rely on the large sample deviation to
interpret the coefﬁcients, we chose instead to use a more moderate value of a 50
percent change in the air trafﬁc growth rate. There are only 42 communities (16%) in
our sample whose air trafﬁc growth rate changed by 50 percent or less. While this
may not be a very large number, we think this conservative scenario is more
representative for out-of-sample periods. The kind of changes in air trafﬁc growth
rates that happened around the deregulation period are probably much larger than
what we tend to observe today. In fact, the change in air trafﬁc growth rate at the
national level between 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 is 43 percent (source: Department
of Transportation).

signiﬁcant growth. These effects are comparable in magnitude to
similar studies in the literature.12

Our paper contributes to the broader literature on the determi-
nants of urban growth, among which transportation infrastructure
is one. In two related papers, Glaeser et al. (1992) and Glaeser et al.
(1995) provide a framework for analyzing the determinants of
urban growth. While they employ their set-up to examine the
effect of agglomeration economies and human capital on urban
growth, we focus on the role of air services. A study closer to ours
is Duranton and Turner (2012), which examines the causal relation
between road transportation and city growth. The study ﬁnds large
and signiﬁcant effects of highway kilometers on employment and
population growth, focusing particularly on intra-city transporta-
tion investments as the main determinants of growth. Using his-
torical data on U.S.
railroad construction, Donaldson and
Hornbeck (2013) assess the importance of railroads to the national
economy by quantifying the changes in the agricultural land values
resulting from improvements in market access at county level.
Banerjee et al. (2012) and Faber (2013) focus on a rapidly growing
developing country such as China, and investigate empirically how
access to transport infrastructure (e.g., railroads, highways) affects
regional economic growth. They ﬁnd mixed results regarding the
local beneﬁts of transport infrastructure investments.

Our paper also complements an expanding literature evaluating
other economic consequences of transport infrastructure projects.
A prior line of research has examined the aggregate relationship
between public spending and economic growth ﬁnding mixed
results.13 The availability of historical data on road or railroad con-
struction at detailed geographical level has spurred a number of
new studies on the impact of infrastructure, though most of these
papers focus on how infrastructure affects trade between regions
rather than regional growth.14

The remainder of our paper proceeds as follows. The next sec-
tion describes the context and consequences of
the Airline
Deregulation Act of 1978. Section 3 lays out the empirical model
and discusses the estimation methodology. The data sources are
presented in Section 4, while Section 5 describes the estimation
results. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2. The 1978 aviation deregulation and its appropriateness as a
quasi-natural experiment

2.1. Institutional background

The 1978 Aviation Deregulation Act (ADA) in the United States
was a signiﬁcant policy change that led to swift and dramatic
transformations in the aviation industry. Important for our purpos-
es, the evidence suggests that it had a number of features that
make it an appropriate quasi-natural experiment.

First, the regulatory regime had clearly and systematically dis-
torted air service patterns from what one would see in the free

12 For example, Duranton and Turner (2012) ﬁnd that a 10 percent increase in a
city’s stock of highways leads to 1.5 percent increase in local employment over a 20-
year period.
13 See Aschauer (1989), Munnell (1992), Holtz-Eakin (1994), Evans and Karras
(1994), and Shirley and Winston (2004). Fernald (1999) and Chandra and Thompson
(2000) provide insights into the heterogeneous effect of transportation infrastructure
across industries and counties, which may explain the mixed ﬁndings.
14 Michaels (2008) provides evidence that rural counties with access to interstate
highways experience an increase in trade-related activities such as trucking and retail
sales. Duranton et al. (2014) bring additional evidence for the role of interstate
highways in determining the specialization of urban locations in sectors producing
and trading heavy goods. Sheard (2012) uses the 1944 Civil Aeronautics Adminis-
tration national airport plan as an instrument for current day airport sizes to examine
their impact on the composition of industrial activity. Donaldson (2010) examines
how the introduction of railroads in India differentially affected incomes and prices
across regions.

market following the industry deregulation. Before 1978, the
development and activity of the airline industry was closely over-
seen by the Civil Aeronautic Board (CAB). The CAB was in charge of
certifying and approving new entrant carriers, and assigning them
precise point-to-point routes that they had to operate at predeter-
mined airfares. Except for aircraft capacity and ﬂight frequency, all
operation decisions, such as entry and exit, route allocations, inten-
sity of market competition, and price levels, were centrally deter-
mined by the CAB (Morrison and Winston, 1986). Entry was
tightly controlled, certiﬁcation being awarded on a per-case basis
and only for operations on speciﬁed routes (Bailey et al., 1985).
Rather than aim for industry efﬁciency, CAB regulations strived
to protect the well-being of all existing airlines. It achieved this
by suppressing market competition and favoring cross-route subsi-
dization (Dempsey, 1987; GAO, 1996).15 At the peak of the govern-
ment intervention, in the early 1970s, CAB ceased to certify new
carriers entirely, and even rejected requests by existing carriers to
enter new city-pair routes (Borenstein, 1992).

A second important feature of the deregulation was the fast rate
at which signiﬁcant transformations were taking place, as ‘‘policy
changes followed one another with dazzling rapidity’’ (Bailey
et al., 1985, p. 37). Facing an economic recession, the Ford admin-
istration had an economic summit in 1974, where a consensus was
reached to tackle federal deregulation. The CAB became an imme-
diate focus and a Senate hearing in 1975 brought much economic
evidence to bear that regulation had restricted pricing and entry to
the detriment of consumers. When the Carter administration came
in 1976 supporting deregulation, there was virtually full political
support and the ADA was passed in 1978. In fact, the CAB began
signiﬁcant reforms already by 1977, allowing ‘‘pro forma approval
of discount fares’’ and granting ‘‘permissive route authority, which
would allow a carrier to enter and exit from a route without CAB
intervention’’ (Bailey et al., 1985, p. 33). The ADA speciﬁed full
deregulation by January 1, 1983, but the CAB already had granted
airlines complete route ﬂexibility within a year of the act and new
airlines were entering the market.

A third important feature is that the ultimate effects of the avia-
tion deregulation were uncertain and the industry responded in a
number of unexpected ways. The rapidity of the deregulation pro-
cess, as described above, made the effects unlikely to be anticipat-
ed. The expectation was that the aviation industry would become
much more competitive after deregulation, leading to greater efﬁ-
ciencies and lower prices for air travel. The contestable market the-
ory, combined with the lack of evidence in support of economies of
scale in the aviation industry, diminished any concerns about anti-
competitive effects in markets dominated by single carriers
(Borenstein, 1992). While there is signiﬁcant evidence of lower
general prices and increased competition, in many ways, the actual
transformations that swept the aviation industry since deregula-
tion had been surprising due to ‘‘mistaken expectation and unfore-
seen outcomes’’ (Kahn, 1988). Perhaps one of the most signiﬁcant
yet totally unanticipated responses from air carriers was the
switch from operating point-to-point service to a hub-and-spoke
network. This
transformation increased industry efﬁciency
through better capacity utilization, as captured by higher load fac-
tors per ﬂights (Borenstein and Rose, 2011). It also allowed for
more frequent departures and more ﬂexibility in ﬂight schedules
from hub airports, but at the cost of an increase in the average

15 In documenting the cross-subsidization practice of the CAB Eads (1972, pp. 205–
206) states that: ‘‘the more recent attempt by the Board to internalize the local
service subsidy (by giving carriers routes on which it hoped substantial proﬁts could
be made) required that entry controls be continued. It also meant that the Board, in
deciding which carrier to favor with route awards, had to continue to base its choice
in large part on the need of local service carriers for proﬁt and not on the more
desirable criterion of which carrier would provide the service at the least cost.’’

number of connections and travel distances for itineraries originat-
ing in smaller airports. The restructuring of non-stop destinations
by airport size implied a decrease in the number of non-stop des-
tinations at small and some medium size communities (Dempsey,
1987; GAO, 1996), and a much larger increase in air services in big
cities, many of which had been selected as hub locations.16

A ﬁnal feature of aviation deregulation that is fundamental to
our identiﬁcation strategy consists of the systematic heterogeneity
in the policy-induced shock to air services across locations. The
CAB undertook many efforts to ensure service to smaller commu-
nities under regulation. In fact, the CAB deliberately set fares above
cost in city-pair markets located more than 400 miles apart
(typically large, dense markets), and set fares less than the costs
in shorter city-pair markets (Bailey et al., 1985, p. 20). The loss of
this cross-market subsidization was a primary concern of legisla-
tors when considering deregulation, as there were real fears that
many small (and even medium-sized) communities would face
substantial loss of air service. Ultimately, arguments that com-
muter air services would likely take the place of traditional airline
services in these communities, as well as the institution of the
Essential Air Service program to directly subsidize air service at

communities,

to

In summary, it was well known that the price levels and route
allocations set by the CAB favored small communities. The reverse
was true for large urban areas, where high fares and the sup-
pressed competition hindered the growth and development of air
transport services. As a result, the regulatory environment led to
large and systematic deviations from market forces.

2.2. Descriptive evidence

The evidence for the systematic distortions in air trafﬁc patterns
across city sizes is noticeable in the data. Fig. 1 depicts the average
number of air passengers per city by size category in the years
before and after the aviation deregulation, relative to the national
trends.18 The data representation shows that prior to 1978 small
communities witnessed the largest increase in air trafﬁc – evidence
that the CAB strategies of route cross-subsidization had been effec-
tive at stimulating air service in small locations at the expense of
large communities.19 Following the Airline Deregulation Act in
1978, large urban areas beneﬁted from a relative increase in the rate
of air passenger growth, while small communities suffered a nega-
tive shock to the provision of air services. These trend reversals trig-
gered by the regime switch are consistent with the changes in air
trafﬁc expected from the removal of capacity restrictions and price
setting schemes imposed by the CAB prior to 1978.

Going beyond average tendencies in air passenger ﬂows by city
size group, Fig. 2 documents the differences in air trafﬁc growth
rates between the regulated and deregulated periods. The scatter-
plots bring further support to how large and persistent was the

16 The evidence on the decrease in the number of non-stop destinations at small
cities as a consequence of the aviation deregulation is mixed. While many small
communities indeed suffered a net loss in non-stop destinations reached, Morrison
and Winston (1986) ﬁnd that other factors speciﬁc to the post-deregulation period
are responsible for these service losses, such as increased fuel prices, higher returns to
aircraft equipment elsewhere, or cyclical macroeconomic conditions.
17 Several very small communities did lose air trafﬁc entirely after deregulation.
However, the Essential Air Service (EAS) program allowed many others to keep air
connectivity with the nearest hub airport. For more information on costs and beneﬁts
of the EAS Program, see the General Accounting Ofﬁce report (GAO, 2000), among
others.
18 For ease of representation, each time series has been rescaled by the average level
of air trafﬁc in 1977.
19 The small, medium and large city categories are deﬁned by splitting the sample
distribution of MSA population levels in three equal parts, based on city size
information at the beginning of the sample period.

Fig. 2. City-level changes in air trafﬁc per capita during regulation and deregulation. Note: The y-axis of each scatterplot represents the average annual percentage change in
air passengers per capita at city level. The average percentage change is calculated over two distinct periods: 1969–1977, which denotes the pre-deregulation period; and
1977–1983, which corresponds to the aftermath of the aviation deregulation. The pattern of changes in air trafﬁc per capita differs quite substantially across the two time
periods, suggestive of the major shock to the aviation industry induced by the policy change. The fact that differences in air trafﬁc changes display signiﬁcant variation both
within and across city size groups can be indicative of the heterogeneous effect of deregulation across locations.

impact of the policy change. They also illustrate the heterogeneity
across cities in air trafﬁc changes over time. Even though, on aver-
age, small and medium size cities have witnessed a larger negative
shock to air trafﬁc growth than large cities, when looking within a
given city size, there is still quite a bit of variation in the magnitude
of the policy-induced shock. This aspect is going to play a crucial
role in the analysis, as our estimation will exploit both within city
size and across city size variation in air trafﬁc changes over time.
Besides the large data variation that it generates, identiﬁcation
from a quasi-natural experiment requires that there are no other
confounding events that also affect urban growth. There are two
major events that took place around the same time as the
deregulation of the aviation industry, which could potentially
affect our ability to identify the effects induced by the airline
deregulation on regional growth.

The ﬁrst event is the 1979 oil price shock, which occurred in the
aftermath of the aviation deregulation. The surge in fuel costs and
energy prices in the early 1980s presumably impacted not only the
growth and development of the aviation industry, but also the
economy as a whole. To the extent that these shocks affected eco-
nomic growth differentially across cities of different sizes, then
part of this variation may be spuriously picked up in our estima-
tion. However, we think this issue is less problematic for our data
exercises because our variables of interest are long-run growth
rates computed over a period of time (i.e., 1977–1991) whose start
and end dates are distant from the oil crisis and its aftermath.20

A second series of events that may be of concern for our estima-
tion strategy is the full or partial deregulation occurring during the
same time period in other industries – most notably in the trucking
and railroad industries.21 However, unlike the airline industry, we
are not aware of any evidence to suggest that these deregulation
events led to systematic heterogeneous changes in the economic
activity across regions. While increased competition and improved

expansion and a rapid output growth, these trends have been
observed nationwide. This implies that any systematic deviations
from national trends in local economic growth rates that we identify

pening simultaneously in other sectors.

3. Empirical strategy

3.1. Basic framework

In this paper, we take the view that aviation services are part of
the local fundamentals characterizing an urban community. As
such, they contribute to enhancing local productivity levels while,
at the same time, being a valuable city amenity that enhances the
quality of life.22 In a Web Appendix,23 we build these assumptions
into a simple model of urban growth to formally derive a direct rela-
tionship between changes in air trafﬁc at the community level, and
labor force and per-capita

22 Several channels have been suggested for the productivity effect of air transport
services. First, air travel facilitates face-to-face communication, which is essential for
innovation, technology diffusion, and for coordination and efﬁcient allocation of
resources (see, among others, Gaspar and Glaeser, 1998; Audretsch and Feldman,
1996; Hovhannisyan and Keller, 2011; Giroud, 2013). Second, the availability of air
services reduces transaction costs, increasing the openness of a region to trade (Poole,
2010; Cristea, 2011). This in turn fosters labor and industrial specialization at the
micro level, as well as product diversiﬁcation at the regional
leading to
increased aggregate productivity (Glaeser et al., 1992; Feenstra and Kee, 2008).
Finally, air trafﬁc could raise regional productivity via agglomeration effects and the
associated positive externalities (see, among others, Stuart and Strange, 2004). The
location decision of exporters and multinational ﬁrm headquarters is inﬂuenced by
the quality of air services (Lovely et al., 2005; Bel and Fageda, 2008). At the same time,
both types of ﬁrms are shown to exert positive spillovers on local businesses, further
affecting productivity (Blomstrom and Kokko, 1998; Arnold et al., 2011). Our
intention in this study is to identify an aggregate net effect of air trafﬁc on urban
development, working in part through any of these productivity effects.

T ¼ ½T0; T1, the resulting estimation equation can be written as
follows:

ð1Þ

where Y i stands for population, employment or per-capita income
in city i; Ai denotes the level of air services in city i, as measured
by the total number of enplaned passengers; the vector XiT0 cap-
tures location-speciﬁc control variables that are observable at the
beginning of the time period T and that affect urban growth. Finally,
ai and aT stand for location and time period ﬁxed effects, and eiT
denotes the error term.

Our interest lies in estimating the effect of air services on
regional growth. We expect the coefﬁcient of interest b to be posi-
tive and signiﬁcant.24 A challenge in identifying b comes from the
interdependency between the provision of air services and regional
growth, which raises endogeneity concerns. To address this, we take
advantage of the exogenous data variation generated by the disman-
tling of aviation regulations. Before analyzing the approaches we
take to isolate the exogenous variation in air trafﬁc from any
endogenous responses to the policy change, it is worth discussing
some key aspects related to the speciﬁcation in Eq. (1).

First, the outcome variables of interest – population, per-capita
income or employment – change slowly over time. As a result, long
run growth rates may be better suited for capturing regional devel-
opment. Unlike year-on-year changes, long differences of the data
are more appropriate for correctly identifying any persistent rela-
tion between the variables of interest in the presence of signiﬁcant
autocorrelation (Bertrand and Duﬂo, 2004). For this reason, in our
estimation we consider two long-run subsample periods: one that
deﬁnes an interval of time before the aviation deregulation, and
one that deﬁnes an interval of time following the policy change.
We let the time indicator T index the two time periods, with
T = 0 denoting the pre-deregulation period 1966–1977, and T = 1
denoting the post-deregulation period 1977–1991.25 We choose
the year 1977 as the cutoff point rather than 1978, which is the year
when the Airline Deregulation Act entered into effect, because we
want to calculate post-deregulation long-run changes in air trafﬁc
starting from a reference period that pre-dates and thus is unaffect-
ed by any major changes in routes or price levels triggered by the
policy change.

Second, the period ﬁxed effect aT is important for model identi-
ﬁcation as it accounts for any period-speciﬁc macroeconomic fac-
tors that may inﬂuence regional growth. However, given the
long-run time horizon being considered, it is possible for cities to
go through structural changes in their urban growth paths. These
changes may differ systematically across cities depending on geo-
graphic location, economic size or industrial specialization. To
account for this in our regression model, we control for economic
conditions at the beginning of each time period T. We specify the
vector XiT0 to include information on population size, per-capita
income, factor endowments, and industrial composition at the
MSA level for the base year of each long-term period. This allows
us to implicitly control for things like changes in labor productivity
and skill premium across both periods, as well as across cities of
different sizes.

Finally, to account for location-speciﬁc determinants of urban
growth that may be difﬁcult to measure, we employ city ﬁxed

24 The coefﬁcients b; c are reduced-form parameters whose structure is derived in
the Web Appendix from the proposed urban growth model.
25 The chosen time periods are determined by the data availability on air services,
and by the timing of deregulation. In particular, year 1969 is the ﬁrst year when air
passenger trafﬁc was collected and reported at city level, while year 1991 is the
earliest year that such records have become available electronically. In the empirical
analysis, we provide evidence for the robustness of our results to perturbations in
these time windows.

effects, ai. These control for factors such as economic fundamen-
tals, geographical location, land area, climate, natural resource
endowments, and any persistent socio-cultural characteristics that
may affect the economic growth of a city. Adding city ﬁxed effects
to the regression Eq. (1) allows us to remove location-speciﬁc secu-
lar trends. A direct implication is that the model coefﬁcients are
identiﬁed from the comparison of urban growth rates before ver-
sus after the aviation deregulation.26

This estimation approach is very demanding of the data. If the
policy shock under consideration is not large enough to generate
substantial variation in the variables of interest, or if the time peri-
od is not long enough for the economic outcomes to fully adjust to
their new equilibrium levels, then differencing the data by con-
structing long-run annual growth rates, and removing location-
speciﬁc trends by adding city ﬁxed effects are going to sweep away
any useful information. Fortunately for our identiﬁcation strategy,
Figs. 1 and 2 provide suggestive evidence of substantial variation in
air passenger trafﬁc before versus after deregulation.

3.2. Estimation methodology

Estimating Eq. (1) requires a careful consideration of the data
_AiT, in
generating process underlying the changes in air trafﬁc,
order to understand the main sources of variation and to isolate
the exogenous component. We proceed by discussing ﬁrst the
lengths we can go to fully exploit the quasi-natural policy experi-
ment to identify the effects of air service on regional growth within
an OLS framework. We then describe a number of instrumental
variables strategies that we use to pin down the exogenous portion
of air passenger growth, thus allaying any remaining concerns
about endogeneity.

Given the regression speciﬁcation, the variation exploited for
model identiﬁcation consists of the deviation in air trafﬁc changes
between the regulation (T = 0) and post-deregulation (T = 1) periods,
i.e., D _AiT  _Ai1   _Ai0. To formally derive it, we begin by deﬁning the
level of air trafﬁc in city i at time t. We assume that the CAB rules
imposed during the regulatory period distorted air trafﬁc by affect-
ing both its level and its rate of adjustment to local economic condi-
tions. Thus, air trafﬁc in city i at time t can be deﬁned as:

teristics that explain the level of air trafﬁc in city i, including city
size or income level (which are elements of Y it in Eq. (1)).

From Eq. (2), using the notation _KiT  lnKiT1  lnKiT0

, we can write
the average annual change in air trafﬁc during the regulatory peri-
od as:
ð3Þ
_Ai0 ¼ _a0 þ ðd þ
where the subscript ‘‘0’’ indexes pre-deregulation period variables.
Similarly, we can express the average annual change in air traf-

_Ai1 ¼ _a1  
where the subscript ‘‘1’’ indexes post-deregulation period variables,
and T0 denotes the initial year of the post-deregulation period. Note

26 Given that the estimation sample includes two long-run periods, i.e., T 2 f0; 1g,
the city ﬁxed effects model in Eq. (1) delivers identical estimates as a differenced
model of urban growth rates between the two time periods (Wooldridge, 2002, p.
284).

134

B.A. Blonigen, A.D. Cristea / Journal of Urban Economics 86 (2015) 128–146

that since the initial year of the post-deregulation period coincides
with the last year of the regulatory period (i.e., year 1977 in the
data), in deriving Eq. (4) we use policy-distorted levels of air trafﬁc
for the base year T0 of the post-deregulation period ‘‘1’’.

e

The variation exploited for identifying the coefﬁcient of interest
b in Eq. (1) is then given by the deviation in air trafﬁc growth rates
between pre- and post-deregulation periods. From Eqs. (3) and (4),
we can derive this differential change as:
D _Ai  _Ai1   _Ai0 ¼ D _a  
ð5Þ
The constant term D _a  _d1   _d0 captures the change in air trafﬁc
growth rates between the pre- and post-deregulation periods that
is uniform across all cities in the sample. The term D _Zi captures over
time changes in the growth rate of location speciﬁc determinants of
air trafﬁc. Note that D _Zi is different from zero only for those city
characteristics that witness systematic changes in their long-run
growth rates at the time of the aviation deregulation. This is impor-
tant for model identiﬁcation as many unobservable factors that
jointly determine air trafﬁc and urban growth are potentially evolv-
ing at a constant rate over the two periods of interest T 2 f0; 1g.

e

ai and

Key for our purposes, Eq. (5) identiﬁes the conditions under
which the variation in air trafﬁc changes over time, i.e., D _Ai, can
be taken as exogenous with respect to the unobserved determi-
nants of urban growth (i.e., the residual variation in Eq. (1)). It also
formalizes the channels through which endogeneity may operate.
The regulatory distortions rapidly unwound by deregulation, as
captured by
d, add unique variation to city-level changes
in air trafﬁc. This is the exogenous variation generated by the
quasi-natural experiment that we want to exploit in our estima-
tion. However, city size or per-capita income – the dependent vari-
ables in our baseline model – are likely part of the vector Zi. This
creates an endogeneity problem. Note that the sources of endo-
geneity in D _Ai lie both in the levels (Zi1;T0 ) and per-period growth
rates ( _Zi0; _Zi1) of urban growth determinants. To the extent that
we can isolate the exogenous component of the variation in D _Ai
once conditioning on city characteristics, the OLS estimation meth-
ods should be appropriate to use in estimating Eq. (1). Otherwise,
we need to refer to instrumental variable methods.

At this point, before discussing each estimation method, it is
useful to take a preliminary look at the data and examine raw cor-
relations between the variables in Eq. (5). Table 1 provides some
interesting statistics, with Panel A reporting the correlation
between city-level changes in air trafﬁc and urban growth rates
pre- versus post-deregulation (i.e., corrðD _Ai; D _ZiÞ). In general, the
growth rate changes are not highly correlated among the variables
of interest, reducing concerns about simultaneity or spurious cor-
relation. This is in contrast to the correlation coefﬁcients between
the level of these variables – observed in Panel B of Table 1 – where
the scale differences across cities make the volume of air trafﬁc
highly correlated with the population size and with total employ-
ment.27 Based on this, we can reasonably argue that many of the fac-
tors that simultaneously determine air travel and regional economic
development are eliminated by double differencing the data.

Additional descriptive evidence is provided in Panel C of Table 1,
which illustrates the relatively weak correlation between the vari-
ables’ growth rates in the regulation period (i.e., DZi0) and the air
trafﬁc growth rate in the post-deregulation period (i.e., DAi1). For
example, the correlation coefﬁcient between population growth
in the regulation period and passenger growth post-deregulation
is 0.37, absent any city level controls. Similarly, the correlation
between the air trafﬁc growth rates pre- and post- deregulation

27 While the reported correlation coefﬁcients are calculated based on data for year
1969, this pattern is found for all other years in the sample.

is 0.33, a value that is suggestive of some consistency in the evolu-
tion of air trafﬁc over time, but also of signiﬁcant shocks to its
growth trajectory at city level. Finally, the last row in Panel C
reports the correlations between city-level changes in air trafﬁc
growth (D _Ai) and pre-deregulation urban growth rates (i.e., DZi0).
Again, we ﬁnd little to no evidence of systematic relationships –
suggestive that endogeneity concerns may be limited.

3.2.1. OLS approach

We propose several model reﬁnements to restrict the variation
in air trafﬁc growth to only capture the exogenous policy-induced
shocks triggered by the dismantling of aviation regulation.

Short post-deregulation time window. We shorten the time
horizon over which air trafﬁc changes are measured during the
post-deregulation period as a way to mitigate the impact of reverse
causality. Referring to Eq. (4), by limiting the time frame for T ¼ 1,
we force the vector of city characteristics _ZiT that affects _Ai1 to only
vary due to immediate or short run changes. To the extent that
such changes are not much different from the changes observed
the previous period – e.g., sluggish adjustments – this reduces
the reverse causality problem,
increasing the chances that
D _Zi ¼ 0 in Eq. (5).

In the empirical analysis, we restrict our attention to the time
window 1977–1983 to deﬁne _Ai1, as this period captures the after-
math of deregulation, when the large unexpected changes in air traf-
ﬁc occurred. We choose 1983 as the end-year, ﬁrst, because this is
when the CAB was fully dissolved – suggestive that the industry
had reached a stable equilibrium and required no more oversight;
and second, because year 1983 was relatively uneventful at a
macroeconomic level, reducing the potential for other market dis-
tortions to affect the calculated average annual changes in air trafﬁc.
Observed and anticipated urban growth. As Eq. (5) shows, the
variation in air trafﬁc changes depends on urban growth determi-
nants (both levels and changes). To mitigate endogeneity concerns,
we control for these directly in our regression model. Eq. (1)
already accounts for per-period initial economic conditions
(lnZi1;T0), so what still needs to be controlled for are the observed
( _Zi0) and anticipated ( _Zi1) rates of urban growth. For that, we rely
on cities’ historical population sizes. Thus, we expand our regres-
sion model by including as additional control variables: (1) dec-
ade-long lags of city population (i.e., Li;T0 j for j > 0); (2) per-
period base year city characteristics; and, as a distinct element of
the vector of initial conditions, (3) the level of air passengers per
capita at the beginning of each period (i.e., AiT0 =LiT0 ), as a way to
account for any systematic variation in _AiT across cities. The esti-
mating Eq. (1) now becomes:

with Y standing for population, employment or per-capita income
in city i.

Eq. (6) can achieve proper identiﬁcation by OLS methods if the
remaining residual variation in _AiT coming from the unwinding of
policy distortions is exogenous.

3.2.2. Instrumental variables (2SLS) approach

Differencing the data, and adding control variables and ﬁxed
effects to the regression model may be sufﬁcient measures to elim-
inate any correlation between our variable of interest and the error
term. However, in the event of remaining endogeneity concerns,
we also estimate our model using instrumental variables. For this
purpose, we exploit the differential impact that the ADA had on cities
of different sizes. We instrument for the change in air trafﬁc growth
in city i using the average change in air trafﬁc growth over time

observed across the MSAs in the same size category as city i.
Speciﬁcally, we use the interaction term between the time period
indicator T and each of the three MSA size category indicators to pre-
dict _AiT. 28

Exploiting information pertaining to many cities of similar size
as city i has several advantages. It signiﬁcantly reduces reverse
causality concerns, since much of the data variation contained in
the excluded instrument comes from sources external to city i. It
also mitigates the concern of weak instruments, as we have already
documented the common patterns among cities of similar size in
their policy-induced distortions.

We also experiment with two related versions of the proposed
instrument. First, within each MSA size category, we calculate the
average deviation in air trafﬁc changes among cities other than the
particular city of focus, city i. By construction, this instrument is
now purged of any economic growth determinants speciﬁc to city
i. Second, rather than rely on the simple average of air trafﬁc
changes for cities j – i, we compute instead a weighted average
using the inverse of the geographic distance between cities i and
j as weights. That is, we instrument for _AiT using the weighted aver-
_AjT =Distij, with city j belonging to the same MSA size

category as city i. The main beneﬁt of using spatial weights is to
place greater importance on cities that are in proximity of city i.
To the extent that the regulatory distortions had regional compo-
nents, then such a geography-weighted instrument may have a
stronger predictive power.

Besides their beneﬁts, a potential drawback of these instru-
ments is that, by construction, they may capture more than just
the exogenous changes in air trafﬁc growth induced by the airline
deregulation. For instance, unobserved factors that affect both air

trafﬁc and urban growth, and that change simultaneously with
the change in policy are going to load onto the ﬁrst stage estimator.
To understand how large is this concern, as a preliminary data
check, we inspect for structural breaks in the MSAs’ growth path
around the time of the ADA.29 The results of this exercise, relegated
to the Appendix Table A1, suggest that once accounting for city and
time ﬁxed effects, the average annual growth rate of population,
employment or per-capita income during the period 1977–1983
does not differ from the pre-deregulation period in a way that is sys-
tematically related to the size category of the cities in the sample.

4. Data

The data used in this study correspond to years 1969, 1977 and
1991 (and 1983 for air trafﬁc), and are collected from various
sources. The beginning and end years of the sample period are dic-
tated by data availability, as well as the distance in time away from
the policy shock represented by the 1978 ADA. The data are col-
lected at the city or county level for the 48 contiguous U.S. states,
and aggregated to the level of metropolitan (or, in some cases
micropolitan) statistical areas.30 This seems the most appropriate
spatial unit for evaluating the economic impact of an airport’s air
transport services.

29 To do so, we include the instruments as explanatory variables in a fully speciﬁed
regression model of urban growth, where the growth rate of each economic indicator
used as dependent variable is calculated over the same post-deregulation time
window as the growth rate of air trafﬁc, i.e., 1977–1983.
30 We use the current mapping of counties into the core based statistical areas (the
majority of which are MSAs) available from the U.S. Census through their U.S
Gazetteer Place data from 2006. Even if the current delineation does not correspond
to the one implemented several decades ago, its application throughout the entire
sample period ensures the consistency of statistical areas throughout the panel
period.

a Initial conditions refer to economic indicators from year 1969 for the pre-deregulation period, 1969–1977, and from year 1977 for the post-deregulation period 1977–

1991.

b For the pre-deregulation period, the three lags of population levels correspond to years 1960, 1950 and 1940. For the post-deregulation period, the three lags of

population levels correspond to years 1969, 1960 and 1950.

The air passenger transport data are provided by the Depart-
ment of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion (FAA). We collect the data from the Airport Activity Statistics of
Certiﬁcated Route Air Carriers, which cover the activity of large air
carriers certiﬁed to operate aircraft with capacity of 60 seats or
more. We augment this data with air trafﬁc information from the
Small Air Carriers Database (Form 298C Schedule T1) provided by
the DOT. We restrict attention to domestic scheduled air services
and for each city or airport in the U.S. record the total annual num-
ber of enplaned passengers. We map all U.S. airports or city loca-
tions available in our dataset into the corresponding counties
using information from the FAA, and then map counties into MSAs
based on the concordance available from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Data on population and per-capita income is provided by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis at the county level, which we then
aggregate to the MSA level.31 Employment data – total and by major
sectors (manufacturing, services, wholesale, retail, construction,
transportation and utilities) – are available from the County Business
Patterns (CBP) provided by the U.S. Census.32

After combining all sources of data over the three selected years
1969, 1977 and 1991 (1983 for air trafﬁc), and after screening the
resulting sample for potential outliers, we end up with a set of 263
urban centers.33 Each of these remaining MSAs hosts at least one

31 Nominal per-capita income rates are converted into real values using the
consumer price index (CPI) series provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
32 For the years prior to 1986, the CBP ﬁles are not available electronically from the
U.S. Census, so we use the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social
Research (ICPSR) as our data source.
33 In obtaining the estimation sample, we have dropped the top and bottom 5
percent of cities based on (per-period) passenger growth rates in order to remove any
outliers.

airport that has been active in every one of the three years spanning
the 23-year period. The summary statistics on the variables of inter-
est, including the constructed annual growth rates for the periods
1969–1977 and 1977–1991 (respectively, 1977–1983 for air trafﬁc),
are reported in Table 2. An important thing to notice is the substan-
tial variation in growth rates over the two sample periods, especially
for air passenger trafﬁc.

5. Estimation results

5.1. OLS approach

Table 3 reports the results from estimating Eq. (6) with popula-
tion growth as the local economic outcome of interest. The ﬁrst
column includes city-level changes in air trafﬁc, in addition to a
minimum set of control variables: time ﬁxed effect and initial peri-
od conditions. Population levels at the start of each time period
account for differences across cities in population growth rates,
while the time ﬁxed effect captures any post-deregulation macroe-
conomic shocks that may affect the rate of population growth
nationwide.

Air trafﬁc growth has a positive effect on the rate of population
growth. While signiﬁcant, this result does not take into account the
possibility that prior and anticipated future city growth are not
only correlated with actual urban growth rates, but they also
determine the growth rate of air trafﬁc post-deregulation. To
remove this source of endogeneity, in column 2 we include three
decadal lags of population, in levels. The effect of air service on
population growth decreases in magnitude but remains positive
and signiﬁcant.

Robust standard errors clustered at MSA level in brackets.
Notes: The reported results correspond to the baseline regression Eq. (6). The data panel includes two long-run time periods, 1969–1977 and 1977–1991, deﬁned around the
year of the aviation deregulation. The dependent variable, i.e., annual population growth, is calculated at MSA level over each time period. The main variable of interest, i.e.,
air passenger annual growth rate, is calculated over a shorter post-deregulation period (1977–1983) to better isolate the exogenous variation induced by the policy shock. The
decennial population lags control for previous and anticipated city growth rates. The period-speciﬁc initial economic conditions help to mitigate endogeneity. The time period
and city level ﬁxed effects account for both macroeconomic and for location-speciﬁc secular growth trends. The large city hubs (dropped in the last column) are identiﬁed
based on a classiﬁcation provided by the Federal Aviation Administration.
⁄ p < 0.1.
⁄⁄ p < 0.05

Next, we add to the estimation model regional indicators to
account for differences in economic conditions at city level at the
start of each time period. In particular, the industrial composition
of a city’s activities has been shown to be a signiﬁcant determinant
of urban growth.34 Therefore, we allow the rate of urban growth to
vary over time according to the sectoral composition of cities in the
initial period. The estimates are reported in column 3. As expected,
differences across cities in industrial structure inﬂuence both urban
growth, as well as the growth of air services. Once conditioning on
such linkages, the impact of air trafﬁc changes on population growth
decreases in magnitude, but remains positive and highly signiﬁcant.
Finally, there are several other location speciﬁc characteristics
that need to be considered but may be difﬁcult to measure. Some
of these characteristics are time invariant, like geographic location,

34 Glaeser et al. (1992) provides evidence that inter-industry knowledge spillovers,
which are facilitated by a diverse industrial base, explain economic agglomerations.
At the same time, the industrial composition of a region also determines its average
level of human capital, inﬂuencing income levels and consumption. More important-
ly, Brueckner (2003) provides evidence from a cross-section of MSAs that services
beneﬁt more than manufacturing activities from the availability and quality of air
services.

natural resources, or climate. Other factors, even if location-speci-
ﬁc, may evolve at a constant rate over time. To account for such
factors that simultaneously determine air travel and urban growth
rates, we rely on city ﬁxed effects as solution. Column 4 of Table 3
reports the results from such a fully speciﬁed regression model.
This is our preferred speciﬁcation. The coefﬁcient on the variable
of interest remains positive and signiﬁcant, with a 50 percent
increase in the annual air trafﬁc growth rate leading to a 1.55 per-
cent increase in the annual population growth rate, on average.35
Cumulating the resulting change in population over time, this

35 There is a lot of variation across communities in the change in air trafﬁc growth
rates between the pre- and post-deregulation periods. The median city in the sample
witnessed an average  1.9 percent annual growth rate in air passenger trafﬁc in the
time period following the deregulation, and this represents a negative 123 percent
change relative to the average annual growth rate observed in the regulation period.
To interpret our estimation coefﬁcients, rather than rely on the large sample
deviation, we chose to use a more moderate value of a 50 percent change in the air
trafﬁc growth rate. In the sample, there are 42 (16%) communities whose air trafﬁc
growth rate changed by up to 50 percent. While this may not be a very large number,
we think this conservative scenario is more representative for out-of-sample periods.
The kind of changes in air trafﬁc growth rates that happened around the aviation
deregulation period are probably much larger than what we tend to observe today.

corresponds to a 0.42 percent additional increase in the population
of the average city after a 20-year period.36

We further examine the sensitivity of our results to sample
composition by verifying whether our estimates are driven by a
subset of cities, in particular, by large hub airports. We identify
the MSAs that host the largest airport hubs based on the airport
classiﬁcation compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA). Column 5 reports the results from a fully speciﬁed model
estimated on a subsample that excludes large hub cities. While
the effect of air trafﬁc on urban growth decreases in magnitude,
it remains positive and signiﬁcant. This provides evidence that
our ﬁnding is not a local result, driven by a particular subset of
urban centers in our sample.

36 To arrive at this number, we take the annual population growth rate of an average
city in the sample, computed over the period 1969–1991, which is equal to 1.365 per
year. Then, a 50 percent increase in the air trafﬁc growth rate predicts an annual
pop ¼ ð1 þ 0:0155Þ1:365 ¼ 1:386. We then apply the
growth rate of population of: gpredict

¼ 1:0042 or 0.42 percent.

Overall, the estimates in Table 3 provide robust evidence that
urban growth, as measured by population size, is directly affected
by the provision of air services. Next, we investigate whether per-
capita income responds in a similar manner. If air services are an
important factor into productivity changes, then a standard model
of urban growth predicts that they should directly affect changes in
per-capita income as well.

Table 4 reports the estimation results following the same model
speciﬁcations as in columns 3–5 of Table 3. In all of the estimated
regressions, the impact of air trafﬁc on per-capita income growth is
positive and signiﬁcant. The magnitude of the effects decreases as
we control for omitted variable bias by gradually accounting in our
estimation for city characteristics that simultaneously affect air
trafﬁc and urban growth rates. Based on the preferred speciﬁcation
reported in column 2, a 50 percent increase in the air passenger
growth rate leads to a 1.65 percent increase in the annual growth
rate of per-capita income, on average. To put results in perspective,
the annual income growth rate calculated over the sample period
is 1.76 percent for the average city. Cumulating the resulting
change in per-capita income over a 20-year period, this corre-
sponds to a 0.57 percent additional
increase in the level of

B.A. Blonigen, A.D. Cristea / Journal of Urban Economics 86 (2015) 128–146

139

per-capita income for the average city. These effects are almost
identical when we eliminate the large hub cities from the sample
(see column 3).

While there are several reasons why population growth may be
preferred to employment as an indicator of regional growth, it is
customary in the urban economics literature to investigate the
effects of air trafﬁc on regional employment. Research work has
shown that agglomerations, through the positive externalities they
provide, represent a strong force of attraction for future businesses.
Furthermore, the effect of air passenger services on employment
growth may operate not only through productivity effects, but also
through quality of life considerations (i.e., urban amenities).

The results explaining the growth in employment are provided
in columns 4–6 of Table 4. Again, the columns report the estimates
from speciﬁcations that gradually incorporate an increasing set of
control variables to explain the differences in employment growth
across communities (following the same pattern as columns 1–3 of
the same table). Focusing on the most complete speciﬁcation
reported in column 5, we ﬁnd that a 50 percent increase in the rate
of regional air trafﬁc growth leads to a 2.7 percent increase in
annual employment growth, on average. The coefﬁcient is larger
in magnitude than the effect of trafﬁc growth on population, sug-
gestive of additional channels through which air services affect
employment growth that operate independently from population
growth determinants. To put results in perspective, the annual
employment growth rate calculated over the sample period is 3
percent for the average city. Cumulating the resulting change in
employment over a 20-year period, this leads to an additional
increase in total employment of 1.6 percent for the average city.
By dropping the large hub cities from our sample, the magnitude
of the main coefﬁcient of interest decreases slightly but remains
highly signiﬁcant (column 6). This reveals that the estimated aver-
age employment effects are not driven by a particular subgroup of
cities, but are in fact representative for the entire sample of urban
centers.

5.2. Instrumental variables (2SLS) approach

To address any remaining endogeneity concerns, we experi-
ment with two sets of excluded instruments. We exploit informa-
tion on the differences in regulatory distortions across cities based
on their size. Table 5 reports the 2SLS estimation results for each of
the three urban growth indicators as dependent variable. For con-
ciseness, we only report the coefﬁcients for the variable of interest,
however the estimated model includes the complete set of controls
and ﬁxed effects used in prior estimations.

Columns 1–4 of Table 5 include the 2SLS estimates for the
speciﬁcation explaining urban population growth. We ﬁrst instru-
ment for the difference in the growth rate of air trafﬁc over time
using the average air trafﬁc change observed across cities within
the same size category. That is, we use the interaction terms
between the post-deregulation time indicator and city size indica-
tors, distinguishing between small, medium or large cities. The
results are reported in column 1. In the subsequent columns, we
experiment with variants of the proposed instrument. In column
2 we use as instrument the average air trafﬁc change observed in
other cities within the same size category as the city in question.
In column 3 we use proximity as criteria to weight the other cities
whose air trafﬁc changes are used in predicting a city’s response to
deregulation. If regulatory distortions have regional-speciﬁc com-
ponents, we are able to exploit that additional source of exogenous
variation with this location-speciﬁc instrument. In column 4, we
combine the predictive power of the last two instruments by using
them together in the same regression.

Across all four 2SLS speciﬁcations, the effect of air trafﬁc on
population growth remains positive and statistically signiﬁcant.

Using the coefﬁcient from column 1, a 50 percent increase in the
air passenger growth rate leads to a 4.15 percent increase in the
annual rate of population growth, on average. Comparing columns
1–4, there are no notable differences between the estimated coef-
ﬁcient of interest. However, the IV estimates are larger in magni-
tude when compared to the OLS results from column 4 in
Table 3. While this direction of change may seem contrary to the
expected positive correlation between air trafﬁc and population
growth rates, this outcome is not new to the literature (e.g.,
Duranton and Turner, 2012; Duranton et al., 2014). Like others
have pointed out, transportation infrastructure might get allocated
disproportionately to cities that are less productive, poorer and
that grow slower, which explains the underlying negative correla-
tion. Put differently, unobservable factors causing urban growth
during the regulation period may have determined the CAB to inef-
ﬁciently allocate air services across communities, oversupplying
the cities witnessing slower growth at the expense of rapidly grow-
ing areas. In addition, much of the positive correlation between air
trafﬁc and urban growth is already accounted for by the control
variables and the regression ﬁxed effects. Lastly, it is also possible
that air trafﬁc changes are measured or recorded with error at city
level, inducing attenuation bias in the OLS estimates.

Two conditions are necessary for these proposed variables to
qualify as valid instruments. First, the excluded instruments need
to be correlated with city level changes in air trafﬁc growth, condi-
tional on all the right-hand side regression variables. In that
respect, both the anecdotal evidence and the data representation
in Fig. 2 seem to give support to this condition. Second, the exclud-
ed instruments must not be correlated with the residual from the
urban growth regression. Here, it is important to emphasize that
the model speciﬁcation directly controls for the city size at the
beginning of each period, as well as for the city’s history of eco-
nomic growth, in addition to accounting for secular trends using
city ﬁxed effects. This removes concerns about omitted variable
bias, minimizing the ways in which the excluded instruments
could be correlated with the urban growth residual.

Formal tests for the validity of the excluded instruments are
reported at the bottom of Table 5. From the ﬁrst stage coefﬁcients,
it appears that the excluded instruments are jointly signiﬁcant in
explaining changes over time in air trafﬁc growth. The reported
F-statistic and the partial R-squared are large, being well above
the conventional critical levels. Furthermore, the overidentiﬁcation
test for the exogeneity of the excluded instruments also provides
support for their choice. Based on the reported Hansen J-statistic,
the test fails to reject the hypothesis that the instruments are
uncorrelated with the residual from the population growth regres-
sion (once conditioning on all the control variables and ﬁxed
effects).

Moving to the speciﬁcations explaining per-capita income
growth, we report the corresponding 2SLS estimates in columns
5–8 of Table 5. We exploit the same set of excluded instruments
as before (in columns 1–4), and we ﬁnd a similar pattern of results.
The effect of air trafﬁc on per-capita income growth is positive and
signiﬁcant in all of the 2SLS estimations, and the magnitude of the
coefﬁcient is almost double in size compared to the OLS result
(reported in Table 4). Based on the estimate from column 5, a 50
percent increase in the air passenger growth rate leads to a 3.2 per-
cent increase in the annual rate of per-capita income growth, on
average. Since the estimated regression model is no different from
the one explaining population growth, the ﬁrst stage coefﬁcients
reported at the bottom of columns 5–8 are identical to the ones
in columns 1–4. Only the test of overidentifying restrictions pro-
vides different statistics due to a change in the dependent variable.
Judging from the reported Hansen J statistic, the chosen instru-
ments are exogenous to the regression model, being orthogonal
to the residual income growth rates.

Notes: The reported results correspond to the regression Eq. (6) estimated by instrumental variables methods (2SLS). We instrument for the variable of interest – air passenger annual growth rate – using the following excluded
instruments: (1) a time dummy for the post-deregulation period, allowed to vary by city size category (this measure corresponds to the deviation in air trafﬁc changes over time observed among cities within the same size groups);
(2) the average air trafﬁc growth rate of other cities within the same size category; (3) the average air trafﬁc growth rate of other cities within the same size category, weighted by distance. Because of the presence of city ﬁxed
effects, the variation exploited by the last two instruments also consists of deviations in air trafﬁc changes over time. The complete list of the controls and ﬁxed effects from prior estimations are included in all the reported
speciﬁcations.

Notes: The reported results correspond to the baseline regression Eq. (6), with the modiﬁcation that sector level employment growth rates are used as dependent variables. The data panel includes two long-run time periods, 1969–
1977 and 1977–1991, deﬁned around the year of the aviation deregulation. The dependent variable, i.e., annual growth in sector level employment, is calculated at MSA level over each time period. The main variable of interest, i.e.,
air passenger annual growth rate, is calculated over the shorter post-deregulation period (1977–1983) to better isolate the exogenous variation induced by the policy shock. To remove endogeneity concerns, in the reported 2SLS
estimates in columns 2, 5, 8 and 11, the growth rate of air trafﬁc is instrumented by the same excluded variables as those reported in column 1 of Table 5. Further, in the reported 2SLS in columns 3, 6, 9 and 12, the growth rate of air
trafﬁc is instrumented by the same excluded variables as those reported in column 4 of Table 5. The ﬁrst stage regression leads to the same estimates as previously reported. The complete list of the controls and ﬁxed effects from
prior estimations are included in all the reported speciﬁcations.

Notes: The reported results correspond to the baseline regression Eq. (6). The data panel includes two long-run time periods, 1969–1977 and 1977–1991, deﬁned around the
year of the aviation deregulation. The dependent variable, i.e., average annual change in the number of ﬁrms, is calculated at MSA level over each time period. The main
variable of interest, i.e., air passenger annual growth rate, is calculated over the shorter post-deregulation period (1977–1983) to better isolate the exogenous variation
induced by the policy shock. The decennial population lags control for previous and anticipated city growth rates. The period-speciﬁc initial economic conditions help to
mitigate endogeneity. The time period and city ﬁxed effects account for both macroeconomic and location-speciﬁc secular growth trends. The large city hubs (dropped in the
last column) are identiﬁed based on a classiﬁcation provided by the Federal Aviation Administration.

Finally, columns 9–12 of Table 5 report the 2SLS estimates for
total employment as measure of urban growth. The pattern of
results observed so far applies to this speciﬁcation as well. Again,
we ﬁnd that the 2SLS estimates for the effect of air trafﬁc growth
are positive and signiﬁcant, with a magnitude that is almost twice
the size of the corresponding OLS coefﬁcient from column 5 in
Table 4. The same reasoning for this ﬁnding that we provided ear-
lier applies here as well. Based on the estimate reported in column
9, a 50 percent increase in the air passenger growth rate leads to a
5.5 percent increase in the annual rate of employment, on average.
The reported tests of overidentifying restrictions validate once
again the excluded instruments’ exogeneity.

To summarize the results so far, we have pursued a variety of
estimation strategies to identify a causal effect of the growth in
air trafﬁc on the economic development and long-run growth of
U.S. cities, and found surprisingly consistent and robust evidence
for a positive and signiﬁcant effect.

5.3. Robustness exercises

This section describes additional data exercises that bring sup-
port to the results of the paper. The aim here is twofold. First, we
want to shed some light on the channels through which air trafﬁc
changes affect urban growth. For that reason, we focus attention on
employment composition effects, as well as on the expansion in
the number of local businesses. Second, we want to verify the
robustness of our ﬁndings to the choice of time windows, as well

as to the use of the quasi-natural experiment as a source of exoge-
nous data variation.

5.3.1. Sectoral decomposition and ﬁrm extensive margin

Studies analyzing the impact of road infrastructure ﬁnd robust
evidence that retail and wholesale industries beneﬁt the most from
improved market access and lower transportation costs (Michaels,
2008). Similarly, studies focusing on air transport have shown that
service sectors have been the most responsive to the availability of
air services (Brueckner, 2003). Following this practice, we exploit
the sectoral disaggregation available in the city level employment
data to investigate the sectors whose labor demand is sensitive to
changes in air passenger transport.

The results reported in Table 6 are consistent with the prior lit-
erature.
It seems that the total employment effects that we
documented earlier are mainly driven by employment growth in
services and in trade-related industries. This ﬁnding is consistent
across OLS and 2SLS speciﬁcations (where the latter are estimated
using average deregulation shocks by city size category as
instruments).37

A second robustness exercise examines the impact of air traf-
ﬁc changes on the establishment of new businesses in a location.

37 This ﬁnding gives support to early reports by the CAB suggesting that market
towns – where trading is the most important occupation – and diversiﬁed cities –
which have a signiﬁcant representation of government, ﬁnance or professional
activities – represent the type of cities that generate the largest demand for air trafﬁc
(Sealy, 1968, p. 149; Eads, 1972).

Notes: This table veriﬁes the sensitivity of our results to the chosen time window over which growth rates are calculated for the post-deregulation period. The data sample
used in all prior estimations spans two long-run time periods, 1969–1977 and 1977–1991, deﬁned around the year of the aviation deregulation. The air trafﬁc growth rate has
been calculated over the shorter period 1977–1983 to better isolate the exogenous variation induced by the policy shock. The reported coefﬁcients correspond to the variable
of interest, i.e., air trafﬁc growth, and are obtained from the baseline regression Eq. (6). To remove endogeneity concerns, in the reported 2SLS estimates in columns 2, 5, and 8,
the growth rate of air trafﬁc is instrumented by the same excluded variables as those reported in column 1 of Table 5. Furthermore, in the reported 2SLS estimates in columns
3, 6, and 9, the growth rate of air trafﬁc is instrumented by the same excluded variables as those reported in column 4 of Table 5. The complete list of the controls and ﬁxed
effects from prior estimations are included in all the reported speciﬁcations. The unreported number of observations is 524 (520 in 2SLS regressions) and the R-squared varies
between 0.548 and 0.929.
⁄ p < 0.1.
⁄⁄ p < 0.05.
⁄⁄⁄ p < 0.01.

While we found direct evidence of employment growth at city
level, it is not clear whether this is caused by production growth
among existing ﬁrms (i.e., intensive margin effect), or by the
entry of new ﬁrms (i.e., extensive margin effect). This distinction
may be important to policy makers as business agglomerations
are known to generate positive spillovers (e.g., Baldwin and
Martin, 2004). Using information on the number of businesses
operating in a location, which is available from the County Busi-
ness Patterns database, we estimate the same fully speciﬁed
regression model as before and report the estimates in Table 7.
Columns 1 and 2 provide OLS estimates on a sample with and
without large city hubs. Columns 3 and 4 report 2SLS estimates
using the average growth in air trafﬁc across cities of similar size
category as instruments. Across all estimations, air
trafﬁc
changes have a positive and signiﬁcant effect on the growth in
the number of local businesses. Depending on speciﬁcation, a
50 percent increase in the air trafﬁc growth rate leads to an
increase in the growth of the number of ﬁrms between 2 and
6.75 percent. Once again, we ﬁnd that the 2SLS estimates are
larger in magnitude than the OLS counterparts, which may be
the result of either attenuation bias from measurement error
in ﬁrm count, or, more likely, from a disproportionate allocation
of air services to slow growing cities during the CAB regulatory
period.

5.3.2. Coefﬁcient sensitivity to variations in time windows

One consideration regarding our econometric strategy is that
the time periods over which the growth rates are calculated may
have a direct impact on the data variation used for model identiﬁ-
cation. This is true especially if macroeconomic factors have a dif-
ferential impact across cities in the years deﬁning the time window
under consideration, case in which the time ﬁxed effect is not able
to account for this heterogeneity. For instance, in constructing the
long-run urban growth rates, we have chosen year 1991 as the
end-point of the post-deregulation period. However, year 1991 is
a recession year. This could attenuate the long-run growth rates
used for model identiﬁcation, becoming particularly problematic
if the recession had a more negative effect on small or medium size
cities compared to large cities (potentially leading to spurious
correlation).

To assess the robustness of our ﬁndings, we evaluate the sensi-
tivity of our estimates to changes in the time window deﬁning the
post-deregulation period.38 Table 8 povides the results, reporting
only the coefﬁcient for the air trafﬁc growth rate estimated both
by OLS and 2SLS methods. We consider four time periods as alterna-

38 Since the regression model controls for initial economic conditions (i.e., base year
city characteristics), the starting periods are less of a concern for inﬂuencing the
econometric analysis and the estimates.

Notes: The reported results are the outcome of a placebo experiment deﬁned over the period 1983–1994. Year 1987 is set as the time of a hypothetical aviation deregulation
episode, such that the period 1983–1987 becomes the ‘‘pre-deregulation’’ period, and 1987–1994 becomes the ‘‘post-deregulation’’ period. We further limit the ‘‘post-
deregulation’’ adjustment period for air trafﬁc growth to the time window 1987–1991. The reported estimates in columns 1–3 correspond to the baseline regression Eq. (6),
estimated using the redeﬁned pre- versus post-deregulation periods. The reported estimates in columns 4–5 correspond to the ﬁrst stage estimates for air trafﬁc growth. The
set of excluded instruments are the same as reported in column 1, respectively 4 of Table 5. The complete list of the controls and ﬁxed effects from prior estimations are
included in all the reported speciﬁcations.

tives to the baseline case, and report the coefﬁcients for each distinct
time period by row. The ﬁrst two alternative time periods corre-
spond to deviations from the end-year 1991 deﬁning the post-
deregulation period over which the urban growth indicators are cal-
culated. The next two period redeﬁnitions correspond to deviations
from end-year 1983, deﬁning the period over which air trafﬁc
growth rates are calculated. Comparing the estimates by column
across all rows, it becomes clear that our ﬁndings are not sensitive
to the time window being considered. All the estimates are positive
and signiﬁcant, being reasonably close in magnitude to our baseline
results.

5.3.3. Placebo test

To verify the robustness of our results to the identiﬁcation
mechanism – which exploits the large and permanent policy shock
of the 1978 aviation deregulation – we develop a placebo test
based on an arbitrary deregulation year. Focusing on a period with
no major policy changes affecting air services, such as the post-
deregulation period 1983–1994, we select year 1987 as a hypo-
thetical deregulation year and deﬁne the time period 1983–1987
as the ‘‘regulatory’’ period, and the time period 1987–1991 as the
‘‘aftermath’’ of the hypothetical policy change. To maintain the
same pattern in the construction of the data sample as before,
we allow the urban growth rates to be calculated over a longer
‘‘post-deregulation’’ period, i.e., 1987–1994. Using these redeﬁned
time windows, which exploit a purely hypothetical policy shock,
we estimate the same regression model relating the differential
changes in air trafﬁc and urban growth rates, i.e., Eq. (6).

We report the results of our placebo experiment in Table 9. If
the identiﬁcation method correctly isolates the policy-induced var-
iation in air trafﬁc changes across cities, then this method should

fail to detect any signiﬁcant variation using this counterfactual
data sample. The estimates reported in Table 9 seem to conﬁrm
this intuition. The OLS results from columns 1–3 show that devia-
tions in air trafﬁc changes around year 1987 have no effect on
either population, income or employment growth rates. The fact
that the placebo test delivers zero coefﬁcients for the variable of
interest is informative also because it suggests that our data differ-
encing strategy is able to successfully deal with the simultaneity
between air trafﬁc and urban growth.39 While we cannot imple-
ment instrumental variables estimations given the lack of variation
in our variable of interest, we can report the coefﬁcients from the
ﬁrst stage regressions. Using the average changes in air trafﬁc across
cities within the same size category as excluded instruments, the
results reported in columns 4 and 5 suggest that the instruments
have no predictive power in explaining a city’s air trafﬁc growth rate.
Note that these are the same type of instruments that have been suc-
cessfully used in previous IV estimations, when exploiting actual
policy-induced changes in air trafﬁc growth.

6. Conclusion

Public spending on aviation at the federal, state, and local levels
have constantly increased since the beginning of commercial avia-
tion, reaching ten percent of total public spending on infrastructure
by 2004 (CBO, 2007). To evaluate the beneﬁts of such resource

39 While air trafﬁc growth should have a direct effect on urban growth and vice
versa during the deregulated time period 1983–1994, in the absence of any major
policy shocks to air trafﬁc the regression variables loose most of their predictive
power when taking a difference in growth rates around the arbitrary year 1978
(especially in the presence of other control variables and ﬁxed effects).

Robust standard errors clustered at MSA level in brackets.
Notes: The reported results correspond to the baseline regression Eq. (6). The difference from prior estimations is that the two time periods considered here are 1969–1977
and 1977–1983, i.e., the same time periods over which the growth rate in air trafﬁc is constructed. The main goal of these exercises is to see whether there are systematic
changes in urban growth rates over the two time periods by city size category, once accounting for all the control variables and ﬁxed effects previously considered. Since the
interaction terms between the Post-Deregulation dummy and MSA size category indicators are considered as exogenous instruments for the change in the growth rate of air
trafﬁc post-deregulation, it is crucial that they are not affecting simultaneously the urban economic growth indicators of interest.

allocations, it is crucial that we understand the implications of
these investments for regional development and economic growth.
Surprisingly, this research question has received little attention in
the empirical literature, to a large extent because of the difﬁculty
in going beyond correlations to identify actual causation.

This paper exploits the quasi-natural experiment created by the
signing of the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act to identify the link
between airline trafﬁc and local economic growth. Our ﬁndings
suggest that exogenous increases in air services lead to statistically
and economically signiﬁcant increases in regional growth. For
example, increasing the annual growth rate of air passenger trafﬁc
by 50 percent for a given city leads to an increase in the rate of
population growth of 1.55 percent (conservative OLS estimates).
Cumulating the estimated effect over a 20-year period, this corre-
sponds to an additional 0.42 percent increase in the level of
population (we get slightly larger magnitudes with respect to air
service effects on per-capita income and employment growth).

From these estimates, one can do simple calculations about how
much a region may gain in additional income from increased air

service. For example, an average city that witnesses a 50 percent
increase in the air trafﬁc growth rate will gain a stream of income
over a 20-year period, which in discounted present value terms
corresponds to an average 7.4 percent increase in its total real
GDP in 1978.40 This estimate is equivalent to a total discounted
present value of 523.3 million dollars in 1978 for the average city.
Our analysis ﬁnds only small differences in the main results
across communities based on their average size. We also ﬁnd
evidence that shifts in industrial composition are associated with
a growth in the aviation networks. When estimating the
employment effects by sector, we ﬁnd that service and retail indus-
tries are the ones experiencing the signiﬁcant growth effects.

These ﬁndings are important for better understanding the
determinants of regional growth, but also for inﬂuencing policies

40 This estimate corresponds to the stream of income generated over a two decade
period, and combines the effects of air service on population growth and per-capita
income growth over that same time interval. The calculation is done based on the
more conservative OLS estimates.

designed to allocate public infrastructure spending. We note that
the identiﬁcation strategy we use forces us to focus on a period
of time when commercial aviation, while it witnessed dramatic
growth, might not have been as essential to consumers and busi-
nesses as it is today. This suggests that the importance of air ser-
vice for regional growth may be even greater today than our
estimated effects.
