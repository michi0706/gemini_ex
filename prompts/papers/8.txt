BETTING ON EXPORTS: TRADE AND ENDOGENOUS

HETEROGENEITY*

Alessandra Bonﬁglioli, Rosario Crino and Gino Gancia

We study the determinants of ﬁrm-level heterogeneity in a model where innovation choices upon
entry affect the variance of productivity draws. In equilibrium, productivity is Pareto distributed with
a shape parameter that depends on industry-level characteristics. We show that export opportunities,
by increasing the pay-offs in the tail, induce ﬁrms to invest in bigger projects with more dispersed
outcomes. When more productive ﬁrms pay higher wages, trade ampliﬁes wage dispersion by making
ﬁrms more unequal. These results are consistent with how ﬁrm size,
innovation and wage
heterogeneity vary in a panel of US industries and states.

Current research in international trade puts ﬁrm-level heterogeneity at a centre stage.
As documented by a growing empirical literature, ﬁrms differ in size and productivity
even within narrowly deﬁned industries (Syverson, 2004a,b) and these differences vary
systematically with trade participation (Bernard et al., 2012). In particular, exporters
are bigger and more productive than non-exporters, and they pay higher wages. Firm
heterogeneity also has crucial implications for macroeconomic outcomes, such as
aggregate efﬁciency (Hopenhayn, 2014). Yet, despite the growing attention that ﬁrm-
level productivity differences have attracted, we still have a limited understanding of
the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of this heterogeneity.

Although the distribution of the entire population of existing ﬁrms has some
common characteristics that have been documented extensively (Axtell, 2001), these
aggregate statistics mask signiﬁcant heterogeneity across sectors and even between
countries. For example, Helpman et al. (2004) show that cross-sector variation in
measures of ﬁrm heterogeneity is important
for explaining the prevalence of
multinational sales relative to exports. Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2007) ﬁnd that
the standard deviation of establishment size varies with capital shares. Bartelsman et al.
(2009) and Poschke (2015) document instead differences in the ﬁrm-size distribution
across countries. Given that more productive ﬁrms pay higher wages, ﬁrm
heterogeneity is likely to map into wage dispersion and wage inequality also varies
signiﬁcantly across countries. Besides these scant observations, systematic evidence and

theoretical explanations for differences in ﬁrm heterogeneity are still scarce. The goal
of this article is to take a step towards ﬁlling this gap.

We start our analysis by documenting some little-known facts regarding how a simple
measure of ﬁrm heterogeneity, the standard deviation of the log of sales across
establishments, varies across sectors and time in the US economy. We show that this
measure of dispersion can differ by a factor of ten between 6-digit NAICS industries and
that it has increased on average by 11.8% between 1997 and 2007. Searching for patterns
in the data, we ﬁnd robust evidence that sales dispersion correlates positively with the
export intensity of the industry, average sales per establishment and entry. Similar
results hold when using two different strategies for identifying the effect of export
intensity and alternative measures of dispersion, computed over total sales, labour
productivity and also sales of non-exporters only. Next, we propose a novel explanation
based on the idea that the observed heterogeneity stems from technological choices.

To do so, we develop a model in which endogenous investment decisions at the entry
stage affect the variance of the possible realisations of productivity. We then explore
the implications for the equilibrium distribution of ﬁrms and wages in closed and open
economies. Leading models of heterogeneous ﬁrms take the probability distribution
from which ﬁrms draw productivity as given and characterise the resulting distribution
of ﬁrm-level characteristics through the dynamics of entry, exit and possibly growth.
Important examples are Melitz (2003), Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2007), Luttmer
(2010) and more recently Jones and Kim (2014) and K€onig et al. (2016). This article
takes a complementary approach, namely, to recognise that ﬁrms can affect the
variance of their productivity draws at the entry stage.

Although the success in starting a new enterprise or launching a new product is
inherently uncertain, ﬁrms can deliberately choose between investing in smaller
projects with less variable outcomes and more ambitious projects with higher variance.
Such a trade-off is very familiar to anyone pursuing academic research but is also
common in the world of business. For instance, designing and assembling a new variety
of laptop PCs, which mostly requires the use of established technologies, is safer and
less costly than developing an entirely new product, such as tablet computers. In fact,
the ﬁrst tablet-like products date back to the 1980s but did not attain success until the
release of the iPad in 2010.1 Yet, after decades of attempts, Apple was rewarded with
the sale of more than 250 million units over a period of only ﬁve years.

We formalise these ideas in a multi-industry model a la Melitz (2003) in which ﬁrms
can draw a random productivity level upon paying an innovation cost and there are
both ﬁxed and variable export costs. We modify the entry stage by allowing ﬁrms to
choose the size of their investment in projects of unknown quality, which is shown to
affect the variance of the probability distribution from which productivity is drawn. In
particular, a complementarity between the size of the investment and the unknown
quality of ideas implies that larger innovation projects are associated with more

1 In a 1983 speech, Steve Jobs said: ‘Apple’s strategy is really simple. What we want to do is we want to put an
incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes ...
and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything and you’re in
communication with all of these larger databases and other computers’. Yet, inventing the iPad required years
of investment constellated with failures and unforeseen spin-offs, including the development of the iPhone.

dispersed realisations of productivity. A key insight of the model is that the possibility
of exit insures ﬁrms from bad realisations and increases the value of drawing
productivity from a more dispersed distribution. However, bigger projects with higher
variance require a larger investment, which generates a trade-off.2

After solving for the optimal innovation size, the model yields a Pareto distribution
for productivity with a shape parameter that depends on industry-level characteristics in
a way consistent with the patterns found in the data. In particular, export opportunities
induce ﬁrms to draw technology from a more dispersed distribution. The reason is that
trade reallocates proﬁts in favour of the most productive ﬁrms, thereby increasing the
pay-offs in the tail. The model also predicts that high ﬁxed costs and low entry barriers
increase the value of investing in technologies with more dispersed outcomes by raising
the exit cut-off. Hence, it replicates the positive correlation of equilibrium dispersion
with export intensity, average sales and entry. Next, we extend the model to show how
ﬁrm heterogeneity can map into wage inequality, as in Helpman et al. (2010). When
more productive ﬁrms pay higher wages, we obtain another novel result: trade ampliﬁes
wage dispersion by inducing ﬁrms to invest in technologies with more variable
outcomes ex ante and hence making them more unequal ex post.

In the last Section of the article, we go back to the data. Using individual-level wage
data over the period 1997–2007 in the United States, we show that measures of wage
dispersion co-vary with industry characteristics in a way that mirrors the pattern found
for the dispersion of sales well. Most importantly, export opportunities increase
signiﬁcantly wage inequality at the industry level. We then provide a ﬁrst attempt at
testing a speciﬁc mechanism of our model, namely, that export opportunities increase
ﬁrm heterogeneity by fostering investment in innovation. To do so, we follow Aghion
et al. (2015) in switching to geographic data and use patent counts to build a measure
of innovation intensity for a panel of US states over the period 1989–2007. We also
follow Autor et al. (2013) in using the industry composition of manufacturing
employment of each state to construct a state-level measure of export intensity. With
these data, we document two sets of results. First, consistent with the model, innovation
intensity increases with export opportunities. Second, the dispersion of ﬁrms’ sales,
computed now at the state level, is correlated with innovation intensity.

Besides the evidence reported in this article, our theory accords well with a number
of additional observations. Regarding the main premises of the model, several papers
show evidence suggesting that differences in productivity across ﬁrms are related to
investment in new technologies (Dunne et al., 2004; Faggio et al., 2010; Doraszelski and
Jaumandreu, 2013). Our focus on product innovation is also empirically relevant. For
instance, Broda and Weinstein (2010) ﬁnd that almost 50% of the consumer goods
sold in US markets in a given year did not exist four years before. And yet, product
innovation is subject to high uncertainty. In a survey of existing studies, Castellion and
Markham (2013) conclude that around 40% of new products fail.3 Regarding the main

2 In our model, risk is completely diversiﬁed so that investor seek to maximise expected returns. However,
expected returns depend on the variance of productivity draws. As we show, this property holds even if ﬁrms
can choose between productivity distributions that are a mean-preserving spread.

3 Similarly, the US Census reports that only about 50% of start-up companies are still operating four years
after entry. Furthermore, as shown for instance in Cabral and Mata (2003), there is already considerable
heterogeneity among new ﬁrms.

implications of the model, the prediction that low entry barriers stimulate innovation
by fostering competition is consistent with the ﬁnding that competition and entry raise
ﬁrm productivity (Aghion et al., 2004, 2009). The insight that the chance of winning
the extra prize of exporting induces ﬁrms to bet on bigger projects with a higher
variance seems also plausible. Returning to the example of the invention of the iPad,
our model suggests that globalisation made Apple’s strategy so rewarding. More in
general, there is ample anecdotal evidence that ﬁrms competing for global markets are
aiming at more ambitious innovation projects. To name just one example, in 2010,
Google started to invest in the ‘Google X’ project, a semi-secret laboratory dedicated to
making major, high-variance, technological advancements.

This article is related to the vast literature aimed at explaining productivity differences
across ﬁrms (see Syverson, 2011, for a survey). To the best of our knowledge, the link
between innovation choices and the variability of technology has received little attention.
Some papers consider the distinction between radical and incremental innovation
(Acemoglu and Cao, 2015). But these types of innovations differ more in the degree to
which they replace or complement existing technologies, rather than in the variance of
the potential outcomes. Some exceptions are Gabler and Poschke (2013), Bartelsman
et al. (2016) and Caggese (2016), who study how distortions affect the choice between
risky technologies. Yet, even these papers do not study the implications for the distribution
of ﬁrms and wages, which remains an under-explored and promising area of research.

The large literature on trade with heterogeneous ﬁrms started by Melitz (2003) does
study the implications of export opportunities for the distribution of existing ﬁrms (see
Melitz and Redding, 2014, for an excellent survey). As is well known, trade can make
ﬁrms more unequal by reallocating proﬁts and workers from the least to the most
productive ﬁrms. This effect is however very different from the one we emphasise, in
that, it abstracts from the possibility that trade changes the fundamental reason why
ﬁrms are different, namely, the unconditional productivity distribution.4 Moreover, the
focus of our article is on measures of dispersion of ﬁrms’ attributes that are scale
invariant rather than other characteristics, such as average size or the productivity cut-
off for exit, that have been studied more extensively. In this respect, our article is close
in spirit to a nascent strand of literature aimed at exploring the effect of trade on
higher moments of the distribution of ﬁrm characteristics (Mayer et al., 2015).

Some recent papers study the impact of trade on productivity via ex post decisions on
product scope, quality or innovation. These include Atkeson and Burstein (2010),
Lileeva and Treﬂer (2010), Bernard et al. (2011), Bustos (2011), Kugler and Verhoogen
(2012) and Dhingra (2013), among others. These papers propose and test different
channels through which trade liberalisation can raise ﬁrm-level productivity but do not
focus on its dispersion. This literature has also shown that trade can help overcome the
ﬁxed cost of technology adoption through a scale effect, a result that is very different
from our ﬁnding that trade induces ﬁrms to invest in projects with higher variance.5

4 Some papers,

including Yeaple (2005) and more recently Grossman and Helpman (2014), trace
productivity differences across ﬁrms to heterogeneity in ability across workers and managers. We follow the
complementary approach that emphasises the role of differences in technology rather than ability.

5 There is a small literature on trade and risk taking, including interesting work by Vannoorenberghe
(2014) and Fillat and Garetto (2015). In this article, we instead study the determinants of technological
variability in a model where risk is fully diversiﬁed.

Since many technological choices must be made ex ante, especially when new products
are introduced, combining our model of innovation with ex post decisions that can affect
an initial realisation of productivity seems a promising step forward to develop a
comprehensive theory of how productivity differences emerge and evolve.

Finally, several papers have shown, both theoretically and empirically, that trade
impacts wage inequality because exporters pay higher wages (e.g. see all the papers
surveyed in section 10 of Melitz and Redding, 2014). In our model, however, the effect
of trade works not only through the exporters’ wage premium but also by making the
entire wage schedule steeper, with different implications. For instance, our mechanism
predicts that more export opportunities will increase wage dispersion even among the
group of non-exporting ﬁrms. This may help explain why the rise in inequality is often
found to be ‘fractal’, that is, to hold across ﬁrm size groups (Song et al., 2015).6

The remainder of the article is organised as follows. In Section 1, we document some
stylised facts regarding how the dispersion of log sales varies across sectors and time in
the US economy. Motivated by these empirical observations, in Section 2 we propose a
closed-economy model where differences in the dispersion of ﬁrm-level outcomes
originate from technological choices at the entry stage. Section 3 adds costly trade and
shows that more export opportunities induce ﬁrms to draw their productivity from
more dispersed distributions, thereby generating more heterogeneity in equilibrium.
In Section 4, we consider the implications of the model for wage inequality. Section 5
goes back to the data and provides evidence in support of the model’s predictions on
wage dispersion and innovation. Section 6 concludes.

1. Motivating Evidence: Sales Dispersion and Trade

In this Section, we document how the dispersion of sales of US establishments varies
across industries and over time, and how it correlates with a number of industry
characteristics. First, we show that the dispersion of sales differs signiﬁcantly across
industries and has increased over time. Second, we present panel regressions
suggesting that higher dispersion at the industry level is systematically associated with
larger scale in terms of average sales, with higher export intensity and with ﬁrm entry.
Finally, we provide additional evidence suggestive of a causal effect of export intensity
on sales dispersion.7

1.1. Sales Dispersion Across Industries and Over Time

Our main measure of dispersion is the standard deviation of the logarithm of sales per
establishment. We focus on sales because they are an easy-to-observe measure of overall
size, and we take logs to make the standard deviation scale invariant. We compute this
variable using data from the ‘Statistics of US Businesses’ of the US Census Bureau for

6 Dunne et al. (2004) and Faggio et al. (2010) also show that a large fraction of the observed wage dispersion

is between ﬁrms.

7 An antecedent of this analysis is Syverson (2004b), who studies how various measures of productivity
dispersion co-vary with industry characteristics in the US manufacturing sector. Yet, his evidence is limited to
the 1977 cross-section.

the years 1997, 2002 and 2007.8 Data on (receipts of) sales and number of
establishments and employees are available for 453 6-digit NAICS industries
aggregated into sales-size categories. Since we do not have access to the underlying
ﬁrm-level data, we follow Helpman et al. (2004) in assuming that all establishments
falling within the same bin have sales equal to the group mean. Then, we consider each
bin in a 6-digit NAICS industry as a single observation and compute the standard
deviation of log establishment sales across bins using the number of establishments in
each bin as weights.9 Helpman et al. (2004) show that this methodology for computing
dispersions approximates well other measures based on the entire population of ﬁrms.
As an additional check, we have also computed the variance of log sales using ﬁrm-level
data from Compustat. This database is relatively small, as it only includes listed ﬁrms, so
we can construct reliable measures of sales dispersion for 21 aggregate sectors, deﬁned
at the 3-digit level of the NAICS classiﬁcation. While this feature makes Compustat not
very well suited for our analysis, we ﬁnd the dispersion of sales computed on
Compustat to be highly correlated (0.65) with the one we obtain from Census data.

Table 1 reports some descriptive statistics. For each 3-digit manufacturing sector, the
table shows the average, minimum and maximum value of the standard deviation of
log establishment sales across the constituent 6-digit industries in 2007. The table also
reports the average percentage change in sales dispersion in each 3-digit sector over
the previous 10 years.10 For convenience, sectors are ordered by increasing dispersion.
The ﬁrst column shows that the dispersion of sales varies signiﬁcantly across sectors,
ranging from a minimum of 1.69 (in Paper Manufacturing) to a maximum of 2.71 (in
Transportation Equipment Manufacturing). The second and third columns show,
however, that the main source of heterogeneity is within 3-digit sectors: among all 6-
digit industries, the dispersion of sales varies by a factor of 10, as shown in the last row
of the table. The ﬁfth column reports the average number of establishments across the
6-digit industries in 2007. Comparing the ﬁrst and ﬁfth columns reassures that
the dispersion of sales in a sector is not mechanically driven by sample size. Finally, the
fourth column shows that the dispersion of sales has increased remarkably between
1997 and 2007, on average by 11.8% (28.5% if we weight industries by sales). Although
this rise in dispersion is not a well-known stylised fact, it is consistent with the evidence
in Dunne et al. (2004), who ﬁnd that
inequality in productivity across US
manufacturing plants increased between 1975 and 1992, and in Faggio et al. (2010),
who ﬁnd similar results for the United Kingdom between 1984 and 2001.

8 In the ‘Statistics of US Businesses’, information on ﬁrms’ sales is released during Census years and is
currently available for the years 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012. The substantial restructuring of the NAICS
classiﬁcation occurred in 2012 makes it impossible to create a mapping between the latest wave of the data
and the preceding ones for many industries. We therefore use the ﬁrst three waves, which also ensures that
our results are not contaminated by the Great Recession.

9 The number of bins and their width is decided every year by the US Census Bureau. In particular, the raw
data are disaggregated into 10 bins in 1997, 8 bins in 2002 and 18 bins in 2007. The lowest bin contains ﬁrms
with revenue below 50,000 US$ while the highest bin contains ﬁrms with revenue over 100 million US$. The
raw bins are deﬁned in such a way that they can be aggregated into six bins consistently deﬁned throughout
the period. We use this consistent deﬁnition in most of the analysis. However, in a robustness check, we show
that our results are unchanged when using the raw bins.

10 All reported averages are simple averages. Weighting by sales does not affect the qualitative results.

Notes. The standard deviation of log establishment sales is computed separately for 453 6-digit NAICS
industries, using data on receipts of sales and number of establishments in six sales-size bins homogeneous
over time, and weighting the observations with the number of establishments in each bin. The mean,
minimum and maximum value of the standard deviation in each 3-digit sector are computed across the
corresponding 6-digit industries and refer to the year 2007. Percentage changes are computed over 1997–
2007 for each 6-digit industry, and are then averaged within the corresponding 3-digit sector. The average
number of establishments in a 3-digit sector is the mean across the corresponding 6-digit industries in 2007.

1.2. Exploring the Data: Correlations

To explore the data further, we now exploit variation across 6-digit industries and over
time, and study how the dispersion of sales correlates with a number of industry
characteristics. Among the covariates, we consider the logs of average sales per
establishment, number of establishments, export
total employment,
intensities in physical capital and raw materials, and average educational attainment,
as well as the standard deviation of log education across workers. Export intensity is the
ratio of exports to total shipments, constructed with export data from Schott (2008)
and shipment data from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Productivity Database,
and captures engagement in global markets.11 Total employment is the number of
employees at the industry level sourced from the US Census Bureau and is a measure
of the size of the sector. Capital and material intensities are computed as in Romalis
(2004) with data from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Productivity Database

intensity,

11 We have also used import penetration. However, given the collinearity between the two variables, we

focus on export intensity, which is found to be statistically much more signiﬁcant.

and are equal to the ratios of capital compensation and material expenditure,
respectively, over the sum of value added and material costs. These variables are meant
to capture technological characteristics of industries. Finally, the mean and standard
deviation of workers’ education are computed with data from the CPS Merged
Outgoing Rotation Groups. Including these variables can help account for differences
in skill intensity and for the role of sorting between ﬁrms and workers based on
observables.12

We regress the standard deviation of log establishment sales on these industry
characteristics. To have a sense of how sales dispersion may vary with the economic
cycle, we also control for the growth rate of nominal GDP over the two years prior to
each observation.13 We are interested in exploring both the cross-sectional variation,
which may be more informative about the long run, and the time variation in the data.
Therefore, we estimate speciﬁcations without industry ﬁxed effects, so as to exploit the
whole variation in the sample, as well as with industry ﬁxed effects, so as to control for
unobserved industry heterogeneity and identify the coefﬁcients through variation over
time. Finally, since variables may be trending over time, we also estimate speciﬁcations
with industry ﬁxed effects and variables in ﬁrst differences, so as to control for industry-
speciﬁc time trends.

total employment, capital and material

Table 2 reports the baseline OLS results. Columns (1)–(3) show coefﬁcients from
pooled-OLS speciﬁcations, columns (4) and (5) control for industry ﬁxed effects, and
column (6) reports the estimates from the ﬁrst-difference speciﬁcation. Due to missing
data on the explanatory variables, our ﬁnal estimation sample is an unbalanced panel
of 364 6-digit NAICS industries observed in 1997, 2002 and 2007. Standard errors are
corrected for clustering by 6-digit industry to accommodate autocorrelated shocks at
the industry level. In column (1), we start by regressing sales dispersion on export
intensity,
intensity and the mean and
dispersion of educational attainment. We ﬁnd that the dispersion of sales is positively
correlated with all these variables. In column (2), we control for two variables that
capture important characteristics of the sales distribution: average sales per establish-
ment and the number of establishments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that sales dispersion is
strongly positively correlated with average establishment sales but not with the number
of establishments on which it is computed. Among the other covariates, only export
intensity and dispersion of education remain highly signiﬁcant. The coefﬁcients on the
other variables drop in size, suggesting that the effect of these variables might be
mediated by average sales. In column (3), we add GDP growth. The coefﬁcient on this
variable is positive and precisely estimated, suggesting that the dispersion of sales is
higher in periods of economic expansion. All other coefﬁcients are unchanged.

In columns (4) and (5), we add industry ﬁxed effects, including the same control
variables as in columns (1) and (3) respectively. The coefﬁcients on establishment
sales, export intensity and GDP growth remain positive and statistically signiﬁcant.
These coefﬁcients are larger than before, suggesting that the correlations are stronger
within industries. The coefﬁcient on the number of establishments is now positive and
signiﬁcant. This suggests that, while the number of establishments across industries

Notes. The dependent variable is the standard deviation of log establishment sales in a 6-digit NAICS industry.
This variable is computed using data on receipts of sales and number of establishments in six sales-size bins
homogeneous over time, and weighting the observations with the number of establishments in each bin. All
variables except for GDP growth are observed at the 6-digit industry level in the years 1997, 2002 and 2007. All
industry-level controls are contemporaneous to the dependent variable. GDP growth is computed over the
two years prior to each observation. All speciﬁcations are estimated with ordinary least squares. Standard
errors are clustered by 6-digit industry and reported in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote signiﬁcance at 1%,
5% and 10% respectively. See also notes to Table 1.

does not correlate with sales dispersion, entry of new establishments over time is
associated with a higher dispersion. Finally, in column (6), we express all variables in
ﬁrst differences and include industry ﬁxed effects to control for industry-speciﬁc
trends. We still ﬁnd sales dispersion to be positively correlated with average sales,
number of establishments and export intensity.14

In Table 3, we perform robustness checks. To exploit both the cross-sectional and
the time variation in the data, we use both the speciﬁcation without ﬁxed effects and
the richest speciﬁcation in ﬁrst differences. In columns (1) and (2), we re-estimate our
speciﬁcation computing the dependent variable on a sub-sample which excludes the
smallest establishments (corresponding to the bottom 25% of the sample). In columns
(3) and (4), we instead exclude the largest establishments (top 21% of the sample).15
Our main evidence is largely unchanged, suggesting that it is not driven by large or

14 GDP growth is expressed in differences over the previous two years, so we exclude this variable from the

ﬁrst-differenced speciﬁcations to avoid double differencing, which would not have a clear interpretation.

15 The number of observations slightly drops in these speciﬁcations as in a handful of industries

establishments are concentrated in two or three bins.

Notes. The dependent variable is the standard deviation of log establishment sales in a 6-digit NAICS industry.
In columns (1)–(2), this variable is computed excluding observations for the two smallest sales-size bins in
each industry. In columns (3)–(4), it is computed excluding observations for the largest sales-size bin in each
industry. In columns (5)–(6), it is computed using all sales-size bins available for each industry in a given year,
instead of the six homogeneous bins used in the other speciﬁcations. All variables except for GDP growth are
observed at the 6-digit industry level in the years 1997, 2002 and 2007. All industry-level controls are
contemporaneous to the dependent variable. GDP growth is computed over the two years prior to each
observation. All speciﬁcations are estimated with ordinary least squares. Standard errors are clustered by
6-digit industry and reported in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote signiﬁcance at 1%, 5% and 10%
respectively. See also notes to previous Tables.

small establishments. As a further robustness check, in columns (5) and (6), we
re-compute the standard deviation of log sales using all sales-size bins available in each
period, so as to exploit the information contained in the data set fully. The coefﬁcients
are similar to those in columns (3) and (6) of Table 2, which further suggests that our
results are not driven by the number of bins on which sales dispersion is computed.16
Our next step is to dig deeper into the empirical results found so far. The positive
correlations of sales dispersion with average sales and changes in the number of
establishments are interesting properties of the empirical sales distribution. Yet, these
characteristics of the distribution are likely to be jointly determined and it is unclear
how to identify any causal effect. We can instead investigate further the strong
correlation between export intensity and sales dispersion.

16 The fact that our results hold when removing small or large establishments, when controlling for the
number of establishments and when changing the number of bins, suggests that they are unlikely to be
simply driven by granularity in the data.

1.3. Identifying the Effect of Trade

Existing models of trade with heterogeneous ﬁrms offer two candidate explanations
for the positive correlation between export intensity and sales dispersion. One is
reverse causality: industries with higher dispersion of sales may have a higher export
intensity because they are more likely to host more productive ﬁrms which tend to
participate more in export markets (Bernard et al., 2012). A second possibility is trade-
driven reallocations of market shares towards larger ﬁrms. Since total sales include
exports and more productive ﬁrms enter more foreign markets, trade makes the sales
distribution more fat-tailed, a point explicitly made by di Giovanni et al. (2011).17

Our ﬁnding that export intensity is associated with more dispersion even when
removing smaller or bigger establishments may suggest that the correlation is driven
neither by exit nor by exporters. To investigate these possibilities further, we now
attempt to sort out the direction of causality. Moreover, we show that our ﬁndings are
robust to using alternative measures of dispersion that are not directly affected by
participation in multiple markets. The ﬁrst variable is the standard deviation of log
sales per worker (labour productivity). We compute this variable in the same way as our
measure of sales dispersion, using data on sales and employment by sales-size bin from
the ‘Statistics of US Businesses’. The second variable is the standard deviation of log
establishment sales among non-exporting ﬁrms. This variable is based on proprietary
data from Dun & Bradstreet (Worldbase data set), which uses data from different
sources to construct indicators of business activity for ﬁrms around the world and
provides information on the trade participation of each ﬁrm. While we do not have
access to the underlying micro data, we obtained some aggregate statistics and
in particular the standard deviation of log sales among US non-exporting plants for
4-digit SIC-87 industries in 2005, 2007 and 2009.18 This sample differs from our
baseline in terms of industry classiﬁcation and time span but is relatively close to it.
However, since in some cases sales dispersion is computed over few observations only,
when using this variable, we weight the regressions by the number of non-exporters in
each industry in 2005. In this way, we make sure that our results are not driven by
industries where dispersion may be imprecisely measured.

To identify the effect of trade, we use two alternative identiﬁcation strategies. First,
in the spirit of Autor et al. (2013), we follow an instrumental variables approach to
identify the effect of exogenous variation in exports on the different measures of
dispersion. Second, following Hummels (2007) and Hummels et al. (2014), we adopt a
difference-in-differences strategy based on changes in transportation costs with
heterogeneous effects across industries.

In columns (1)–(6) of Table 4, we estimate the main speciﬁcations instrumenting
export intensity with the sum of exports from all non-US countries to the destination
markets of the United States in each industry and year.19 Our aim is to identify variation in
US exports generated by foreign demand conditions, which would raise both US and

17 However, using French ﬁrm-level data, they ﬁnd that the direct effect of export sales on the distribution

of total sales is rather small.

18 We are grateful to Laura Alfaro and Harald Fadinger for providing this data. See Alfaro et al. (2016) for

more details on the dataset.

19 Estimating the speciﬁcations in columns (3)–(6) by OLS yields similar results (available upon request).

third countries’ exports to the same destination market, while cleaning out variation due
to US industry-speciﬁc technological characteristics, which would only raise US exports
and could induce reverse causality. The exclusion restriction is that, conditional on our
set of control variables, technological shocks in US industries are uncorrelated with those
in other countries’ industries. Most of the increase in world exports over the sample
period was indeed due to the spectacular growth of low and middle-income countries
such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (Autor et al., 2013). It is conceivable that
technological shocks occurring in these countries are largely uncorrelated with those
hitting the United States.

The ﬁrst-stage results reported in the bottom of the Table show that the instrument
has strong power for predicting US export intensity. The ﬁrst-stage coefﬁcient is always
positive, precisely estimated and large, ranging between 0.46 and 0.92 across
speciﬁcations, and the Kleibergen-Paap F-statistics for excluded instruments ranges
from 16.5 to 71.9. The second-stage results show that the coefﬁcient on export intensity
is always positive and is highly statistically signiﬁcant in all speciﬁcations but one,
consistent with a causal effect of exports on the dispersion of sales and productivity.
The only instance in which the coefﬁcient on export intensity is imprecisely estimated
is when using as dependent variable sales dispersion of non-exporters on the pooled
data (column 5). Yet, this is not very surprising because industries with higher export
intensity have fewer non-exporters.

To have a sense of the size of the effect of trade, note that in our sample, export
intensity has a standard deviation of 1.34, while the standard deviation of sales
dispersion is equal to 0.58. Then, our coefﬁcients imply that a 1 SD increase in export
intensity would raise the dispersion of sales by 0.18–0.31 SD. The observed increase in
export intensity over the sample period (21%) explains between 14% and 23% of the
increase in sales dispersion over 1997–2007.

Finally, we show that our evidence is qualitatively unchanged when using an alternative
strategy, which does not rely on instrumental variables but identiﬁes the effect of exports
by exploiting heterogeneous changes in transport costs across industries. In particular,
we regress our dispersion measures on the interaction between the log oil price (Brent)
and the bulk weight of US shipments in each industry, controlling for industry and year
ﬁxed effects. The interaction coefﬁcient is identiﬁed by the differential response to a
common oil price shock across industries that produce goods of different weight and are
thus characterised by a different importance of transport costs. Hence, we refer to this
approach as a difference-in-differences strategy. A negative estimate for the interaction
coefﬁcient would imply that, when hit by a reduction in oil price, industries shipping
heavier goods – which see a larger drop in trade costs (increase in export opportunities)
– experience a larger increase in dispersion.

To construct the bulk weights, we use product-level export data. We deﬁne the bulk
weight of a given industry as the export-weighted average of the bulk weights of its
constituent products, which in turn are computed as averages between air and vessel
transport in 1995, to ensure that the choice of transport mode does not react to changes
in oil price. Columns (7)–(9) of Table 4 report coefﬁcient estimates for three
speciﬁcations, each using a different dispersion measure as the dependent variable.
The interaction coefﬁcient is always negative and precisely estimated, which also points in

the direction of a causal effect of export opportunities on the dispersion of sales and
labour productivity.

The stylised facts documented in this Section raise a number of

important
questions. Why is higher export intensity associated to more heterogeneity across
establishments? More generally, what drives changes in the distribution of sales and
productivity? In the remainder of the article, we propose a novel explanation based
on the idea that ﬁrm heterogeneity stems from endogenous technological choices
made at the time when new products are introduced. Besides its intuitive appeal and
its ability to ﬁt the empirical ﬁndings of this Section, our modelling strategy is
inspired by several observations. First, Dunne et al. (2004) and Faggio et al. (2010)
show evidence suggesting that changes in productivity dispersion appear to be related
to new technologies. Second, by focusing on technological choices made before
heterogeneity is realised, our theory will be able to explain changes in dispersion
across the whole size distribution. This will allow us to explain the striking ﬁnding
that trade seems to raise inequality even among non-exporters. Third, in our model,
export opportunities will induce all ﬁrms to choose technologies with more uncertain
outcomes, a prediction that seems consistent with the ﬁnding by di Giovanni and
Levchenko (2012) that volatility is higher in sectors that are more open to trade.

2. Closed-economy Model

We now build a multi-sector, one factor, model of monopolistic competition between
heterogeneous ﬁrms along the lines of Melitz and Redding (2014). After investing in
innovation at the entry stage, ﬁrms draw their productivity from some distribution and
exit if they cannot proﬁtably cover a ﬁxed cost of production. Differently from Melitz
(2003), we allow the variance of productivity draws to depend on the entry investment.
In this Section, we characterise the resulting endogenous distribution of ﬁrm-level
variables in a closed economy. We defer to the next Section the case in which ﬁrms can
engage in costly trade. For simplicity, we consider a static model in which entry and
production decisions are all simultaneous.

2.1. Preferences

Consider an economy populated by a unit measure of identical households of size L
with quasi-linear preferences over consumption of a homogenous good x0 and
differentiated goods produced in I industries:

Each industry i 2 {1, . . ., I} produces differentiated varieties and preferences over
these varieties take the constant elasticity of substitution form:

The demand for the homogenous good q0 is residual. We assume that the income of
each household is sufﬁciently high to always guarantee a positive consumption of the
homogenous good, which is chosen as the numeraire. In the remainder of the article,
we focus on a single sector and derive results that do not depend on general
equilibrium effects. For this reason and to save notation, from now on, we remove the
index i with the understanding that all parameters can potentially vary across sectors.

2.2. Problem of the Firm

Within each sector, every variety x is produced by monopolistically competitive ﬁrms that
are heterogeneous in their labour productivity, φ. Since all ﬁrms with the same
productivity behave symmetrically, we index ﬁrms by φ. There are ﬁxed costs of
production and of entry, all in units of labour. At the entry stage, a ﬁrm can choose how
much to invest in innovation, a choice that affects the variance of the possible realisations
of productivity. Next, the ﬁrm faces standard production and pricing decisions. We solve
the problem backwards: ﬁrst, we describe the strategy of a ﬁrm with a given productivity
and then solve for investment at the entry stage given rational expectations on the industry
equilibrium. We follow the usual convention of identifying ﬁrms with varieties. We also
assume that labour productivity in the homogenous sector is one so that the wage is one.
A ﬁrm with productivity φ chooses its price and whether to exit so as to maximise
proﬁt, p(φ), subject to a downward-sloping demand curve with elasticity r. The ﬁrst-
order condition for this problem implies that ﬁrms set prices equal to a constant
markup over the marginal cost,

pðuÞ ¼ r

and exit if p(φ) < 0. Using (1) and (2), we can express proﬁt as a function of
productivity:

where A ¼ ½r=ðr   1Þ1 rðXP r=rÞ. Since proﬁts are increasing in φ, the ﬁrm will exit
whenever its productivity is below the cut-off u ¼ ðf =AÞ1=ðr 1Þ

We depart from the canonical approach by making the distribution G(φ) endogenous.
More precisely, we now develop a simple model of investment in innovation projects
generating a Pareto distribution for φ with a mean and variance that depend on ﬁrms’
decisions. The model will formalise the intuitive idea that ﬁrms can choose between
small projects with relatively low variance and larger projects with more dispersed
outcomes.

Before continuing, we pause to discuss brieﬂy why we focus on Pareto distributions.
Our choice is based both on empirical and theoretical considerations. First, the Pareto
distribution is widely used in the literature and has been shown to approximate well
some observed ﬁrm-level characteristics.20 The second reason is analytical tractability.
The convenient properties of Pareto distributions allow us to derive closed-form
solutions for various measures of ﬁrm heterogeneity, which helps in mapping the
model to the data. In particular, recall that our motivation is to explain some stylised
facts about
the logarithm of ﬁrm characteristics, as
documented in Section 1. Since the standard deviation of the log of a Pareto-
distributed variable is just equal to the inverse of the shape parameter, it is clear why we
are interested in endogenising this parameter.

the standard deviation of

Suppose that, in order to enter, a ﬁrm must invest in an innovation project. The
outcome of the project is a technology allowing the ﬁrm to manufacture a new variety
with productivity φ. The realisation of this productivity depends both on the quality of
the project, which is uncertain, and the size of the investment, which is a choice
variable. More precisely, assume that quality, q, of new projects is random and
exponentially distributed:

Pr½q [ z ¼ expð jzÞ;

with support z 2 [0, ∞) and rate j > 0, capturing how ‘compressed’ the distribution
is. Notice that quality is inherently uncertain and exogenous. The ﬁrm can instead
choose the size of the project, s, with minimum s > 0.21 We assume that productivity
depends both on the quality and the size of the project as follows:

ln u ¼ sq þ ln umin

;

[ 0. This equation embeds a complementarity between quality and size:
with umin
resources invested in a bad project (q = 0) are wasted, in that they do not increase φ,
while even a great idea is useless without some investment to implement it. More

20 Although Head et al. (2014) argue that the log-normal distribution provides a better description of the
empirical distribution of ﬁrm sales, they also ﬁnd a considerable overlap with the Pareto distribution, a result
echoed in Mrazova et al. (2015).

21 A positive minimum, even if arbitrarily small, simpliﬁes the analysis by ruling out the case of a

degenerate distribution.

importantly, these assumptions imply that φ is Pareto distributed with minimum umin

Hence, by choosing the size of the project, the ﬁrm is choosing to draw φ from
different Pareto distributions, identiﬁed by the new parameter v  s/j. Since the
standard deviation of the log of φ is equal to v, we can take it as an index of the
dispersion of the distribution. As shown below, v will be one of the key determinants of
the equilibrium distributions of the log of ﬁrm characteristics, such as sales. Moreover,
v also affects the expected value of φ, which is equal to uminð1   vÞ 1, so that mean
and variance are linked. Although we consider this a realistic property, we show in the
Appendix that our main results hold in an alternative model in which ﬁrms can choose
between distributions with the same mean but different variance.

The next step is to study the value of drawing productivity from more or less spread-
out distributions. To simplify the notation, from now on, we rewrite the entry problem
of the ﬁrm as one of choosing directly v, rather than s. Substituting AðuÞr 1 ¼ f into
(4), assuming u [ umin (so that there is selection), v < 1/(r   1) (for EðpÞ to be
ﬁnite) and using G(φ), we can solve for expected proﬁts as a function of v:

There are three reasons why a higher v, and hence more dispersion in the
distribution of productivity draws, implies higher expected proﬁts. First, the possibility
of exit insures ﬁrms against bad realisations and increases the value of drawing
productivity from a more dispersed distribution. Second, more dispersion increases
expected proﬁts whenever the proﬁt function is convex in prices and hence in φ. As (3)
shows, this is the case when r > 2 (i.e. for ς > 1). Third, a higher v increases average
productivity by raising the mean of φ. To disentangle the second effect from the third,
suppose for a moment that umin ¼ uð1   vÞ so that the mean of the distribution is
constant at u and an increase in v corresponds to a mean-preserving spread. Then:

which is necessarily positive when ς > 1 (r > 2), even in the absence of selection effects
(i.e. when u ! umin).22

22 The intuition is that the ﬁrms can expand to take advantage of good realisations of productivity and

shrink to insure against bad realisations, making them potentially ‘risk loving’.

Having characterised the value of drawing productivity from a distribution with
higher v, we now turn to the cost. In order to have a well-deﬁned trade-off, we assume
that there are diminishing returns to investing in project size so that the total entry cost
is a convex function of v. Formally, we denote the entry cost kF(v) with F : Rþ ! Rþ,
F 0ðvÞ [ 0, F 00ðvÞ [ 0 and k > 0. We interpret the factor k as a positive shifter
parametrising all the costs of ﬁnancing the entry investment F(v). Furthermore, to
make sure that expected proﬁts are ﬁnite, we also assume that there exist a v \ 1=1
such that limv!v F 0ðvÞ ¼ 1.

We are now in the position to solve the entry stage. The problem is simpliﬁed by the
fact that all ﬁrms entering a given sector are ex ante identical and therefore face the
same problem of choosing v so as to maximise expected proﬁts minus the entry cost:

Concavity and implicit differentiation allow us to sign the comparative statics for v. The

We can now study the equilibrium determinants of v. A higher ﬁxed cost of

beneﬁt of choosing a more dispersed distribution. A higher elasticity of substitution
raises the value of v by making proﬁts more convex in productivity and by increasing
the exit cut-off. Interestingly, the choice of innovation size and hence v does not
depend on the size of the market, captured by the parameter A. The reason is that a

higher demand increases entry so as to keep expected proﬁt per ﬁrm constant without
affecting the exit cut-off.

The choice of v affects the equilibrium distribution of ﬁrm characteristics. Consider
the distribution of revenues, which matches closely the variable documented in
Section 1. It is easy to show that revenues are a power function of productivity:
rðuÞ ¼ rðuÞðu=uÞ1. Then, from the properties of the Pareto distribution, r(φ) is also
Pareto distributed with c.d.f. GrðrÞ ¼ 1   ðrmin=rÞ1=v1, for r [ rmin ¼ rf .23 Hence,
the log of revenue is exponential with a standard deviation equal to vς. This
immediately implies that differences in the choice of v across sectors will translate into
differences in the equilibrium distributions of ﬁrm characteristics as summarised in the
following Proposition.

PROPOSITION 1. Assume that the solution to (9) is interior. Then, the equilibrium dispersion
of ﬁrm productivity and revenue, as measured by the standard deviation of the log of φ and r(φ) ,
is larger in sectors with a higher ﬁxed cost, f, higher elasticity of substitution between varieties, ς,
and a lower entry cost as parametrised by k.

These results are broadly consistent with the empirical evidence documented in
Section 1. The model reproduces the positive correlation between the standard
deviation and the mean of revenues observed in the data, for two main reasons. First, a
high v, by raising average productivity, increases directly average revenue. Second, even
in the absence of this effect, the average ﬁrm size is proportional to the ﬁxed cost,
which is a positive determinant of v. Since v is decreasing in the entry-cost shifter, k, the
model also reproduces the positive correlation between entry and dispersion. This
prediction seems also consistent with the casual observation that in industries with very
low entry barriers, there are many start-ups but only a few giants survive (e.g. Amazon,
Google and Facebook, in the universe of ‘dot-com’ companies). As long as economic
expansions are associated with lower entry costs, for instance through cheap access to
ﬁnance, the effect of k may explain why faster economic growth correlates to a rise in
dispersion.

Although the model implies a positive correlation between ﬁrm heterogeneity and
the elasticity of substitution, r, this prediction may be subject to qualiﬁcations. A high r
makes the restriction v < 1/(r   1) more binding.24 Moreover, product differentia-
tion is likely to be correlated with ﬁxed costs. This may explain why Syverson (2004a,b)
ﬁnds less productivity dispersion in industries with higher product substitutability.

Furthermore, it is possible to show that revenue-based labour productivity is also an
increasing function of φ and hence shares the same properties.25 Finally, since the
model is static, the results in Proposition (1) should apply to the long-run distribution.

23 If φ follows a Pareto(u; z), then x  lnðu=uÞ is distributed as an exponential with parameter z. Then,
any power function of φ of the type AuB, with A and B constant, is distributed as a Pareto(AðuÞB; z=B), since
AuB ¼ AðuÞBe Bx with Bx  Exp(z/B), by the properties of the exponential distribution.

24 To make sure that this constraint is always satisﬁed, the version of the model presented in the
Appendix assumes that the quality of ideas is less dispersed in industries producing more homogeneous
goods.

25 In this model, revenue per worker is an increasing function of φ because the ﬁxed cost of production is
in units of labour. The model in Section 4 generates variation in revenue per worker across ﬁrms through
another channel.

Nevertheless, given the high rate of product turnover observed in the data, the effects
of changes in parameters may be detectable even in the short-run.

3. Trade and Equilibrium Firm Heterogeneity

We now extend the model by adding the possibility for ﬁrms to export their varieties
subject to ﬁxed and variable trade costs. This will lead to the familiar results that only
the most productive ﬁrms export and that trade forces the least productive ﬁrms out.
This ex post reallocation of revenues will have new implications for the ex ante entry
stage: by increasing the pay-offs in the tail, trade will induce ﬁrms to draw their
productivity from more dispersed distributions.

Consider a world economy composed, for simplicity, of two symmetric countries. To
serve the foreign market, ﬁrms must incur a ﬁxed cost fx in units of labour and an iceberg
variable cost such that s>1 units must be shipped for one unit to arrive at destination.
The presence of a ﬁxed trade cost implies that only the most productive ﬁrms choose to
serve the foreign market. Formally, notice that, in analogy to (3), proﬁts from exporting
are pxðuÞ ¼ Aðu=sÞr 1   fx. These proﬁts would be negative for ﬁrms with productivity
x ¼ sðfx=AÞ1=1. As usual, we restrict attention to the space of parameters such that

Under these assumptions, ex ante expected proﬁts are:

where the two terms represent expected proﬁts from the domestic and the foreign

of trade openness. This index, which varies between zero and one, only depends on
exogenous parameters and determines the fraction of exporting ﬁrms, which is equal
to q1=v. Using this notation and substituting (12) into (11), we can show how trade
affects the elasticity of expected proﬁts to v, and hence the incentive to draw
productivity from a more spread-out distribution:

@2 ln EðpÞ
@ ln v@q

¼ f =fx
q1þ1=v

ln q 1=v

vðq 1=vf =fx þ 1Þ2

[ 0:

(13)

In words, more openness raises unambiguously the return from productivity
dispersion. This result is intuitive: trade offers new proﬁtable opportunities, but only
to the most productive ﬁrms and hence reallocates proﬁts to the right tail of the
distribution. In turn, a higher v increases the probability mass in that tail. This is one of
the main results of the article: the chance of winning the extra prize of exporting
induces ﬁrms to bet on bigger innovation projects with more variable outcomes.

Following the same steps as in autarky, the equilibrium v is implicitly determined by:

FðvÞ :

(14)

Since the left-hand side is increasing in openness (this follows from (13)), and assuming
again the solution to be interior, more openness leads to a higher equilibrium v and
hence more productivity dispersion. This is formalised in the following Proposition.

PROPOSITION 2. An increase in openness triggered by a fall in the variable cost of trade, s,
induces ﬁrms to choose more spread-out productivity draws (higher v) and raises the equilibrium
dispersion of ﬁrm productivity, as measured by the standard deviation of the log of φ.

As in the closed-economy case, a higher v affects the equilibrium dispersion of
revenue. In particular, revenues from the domestic and the export market are Pareto
distributed with c.d.f. GrðrÞ ¼ 1   ðrmin=rÞ1=v1, with rmin ¼ rf for the domestic sales
and rmin ¼ rfx for exports.26 Hence, the model is consistent with the ﬁnding that
export opportunities increase sales dispersion also among non-exporting ﬁrms.

Of course, the analytical results derived in this Section partly hinge on functional
form assumptions and on the convenient properties of Pareto distributions. Yet, we
expect the main mechanism to hold more in general. In particular, as long as trade
raises the exit cut-off and reallocates proﬁts to the upper tail of the distribution, it will
make expected proﬁts more convex in productivity thereby raising the return from
increasing technological heterogeneity.

4. From Firm Heterogeneity to Wage Inequality

We now explore the implications of our theory for income and wage inequality. This is
a natural step: the distribution of productivity is likely to be a major determinant of the

26 Note also that an increase in foreign demand would have the same qualitative effect as a fall in s. In
particular, denoting foreign demand as Ax , we would have q ¼ ðfAx =fx AÞ1=1=s, which is increasing in Ax . A
proportional increase both in A and Ax would instead have no effect on v.

distribution of wages because in the data more productive ﬁrms pay higher wages.
Moreover, recent studies show that a large fraction of the increase in wage inequality is
due to rising inequality between ﬁrms (Barth et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015). We
therefore extend the model to allow for differences in wages across ﬁrms. This will
yield two main results: ﬁrst, it will highlight a new channel through which trade can
increase wage inequality and, second, it will identify some additional variables affecting
the choice of dispersion at the entry stage.

In principle, our theory can be used to study top-income inequality. An immediate
way of doing this is to draw a link between proﬁts and entrepreneurial income. For
example, one could assume that there is a class of agents, entrepreneurs, who are the
only ones who can enter and start new ﬁrms. These agents may be able to ﬁnance part
of the entry cost externally and will be the residual claimants on a share of proﬁts.
Recent models along these lines include Jones and Kim (2014) or Grossman and
Helpman (2014). Since trade increases the dispersion of proﬁts, it will also make
entrepreneurial income more unequal. Several contributions in corporate ﬁnance,
such as Gabaix and Landier (2008), have indeed shown that CEO compensations are
proportional to ﬁrm size and that this can explain why they have increased so much in
recent decades. Our theory can then help rationalise some of the changes in the ﬁrm
size distribution behind this phenomenon.

Another possibility, that we consider more in detail, is to extend the model to study
implications for wage dispersion. In the literature, there are several ways of linking ﬁrm
productivity to wages. With competitive labour markets, wages can vary because of
differences in workforce composition across ﬁrms (Yeaple, 2005; Monte, 2011;
Sampson, 2014). Alternatively, workers could be paid different wages due to labour
market frictions (Egger and Kreickemeier, 2009; Helpman et al., 2010; Amiti and Davis,
2012; Felbermayr et al., 2014). For example, in Helpman et al. (2010, HIR henceforth),
workers matched randomly with heterogeneous ﬁrms draw a match-speciﬁc ability
which is not observed and ﬁrms can invest in costly screening. In equilibrium, more
productive ﬁrms screen workers more intensively to exclude those with lower ability. As
a result, they have workforce of higher average ability and pay higher wages. These
models yield an exporter wage premium and have been found to have considerable
empirical support (Helpman et al., 2016). We therefore now borrow the framework of
HIR to study the implications of our theory for wage dispersion. One key advantage of
HIR is that it preserves the main equations of the basic Melitz model, thereby allowing
us to apply our previous results in a relatively straightforward manner.

We brieﬂy derive the equations of HIR that are relevant for our purpose and refer the
reader to the original article for more details. For ease of comparison, we try to follow the
original notation whenever possible. Production depends on the productivity of the
ﬁrm, φ, the measure of hired workers, h, and the average ability of these workers, a:

y ¼ uhc a;

where c 2 (0, 1) implies diminishing returns to hired workers. Two important
this production function are the complementarity between ﬁrm
properties of
productivity and average worker ability and a trade-off between the quantity and
quality of hired workers. Workers’ ability is assumed to be independently distributed
and drawn form a Pareto distribution with shape parameter k > 1 and c.d.f.

otherwise.

Wages are determined through strategic bargaining between the ﬁrm and workers,
after the ﬁrm has paid all the costs, which are now deﬁned in units of the numeraire.
HIR show that the outcome is that the ﬁrm retains a fraction of revenues equal to the
Shapley value, 1/(1 + bc), and pays the rest

Inspection reveals that ﬁrms with higher revenue sample more workers (higher n) and
screen more intensively (higher ac). Assuming d > k ensures that ﬁrms with higher
revenue hire more workers.

combination of parameters, 1 ¼ ½b 1   c   ð1   ckÞ=d 1, so that in this extended
version of the model, there are more determinants of v. In particular, through their
impact on ς, an increase in c or a fall in k and d leads ﬁrms to draw from more
dispersed distributions. These results are intuitive. As already discussed, more
heterogeneity is optimal for the ﬁrm when proﬁts are more convex in productivity.
In the simpler version of the model, convexity only depends on r. Now, instead,
the proﬁt function is more convex also when there are weaker diminishing returns
(high c) and when screening – which is disproportionately beneﬁcial to more
productive ﬁrms – is more effective, i.e. when worker ability is more dispersed (low k)
and the screening cost not too elastic (low d).

PROPOSITION 3. The dispersion of ﬁrm productivity, as measured by the standard deviation
of the log of φ, is larger in sectors with more ability dispersion and weaker decreasing returns to
scale.

As long as ability dispersion correlates with the standard deviation of educational
attainment, the model is consistent with the ﬁnding in Section 1 that sales tend to be
more heterogeneous in sectors where workers have more unequal school attain-
ments.27 Proposition 3 may also contribute at explaining why the dispersion of ﬁrm
productivity varies across countries and over time. It suggests that ﬁrms in countries
with a more heterogeneous labour force will beneﬁt more from high-variance
technologies and hence be more unequal in equilibrium.28 Likewise, the growing
evidence on the ‘ﬂattening of the ﬁrm’ may indicate a rise in the span-of-control
parameter and this may help explain the generalised increase in productivity
dispersion.

What are the implications for wages? Using the expression of wages as a share of

revenue per hired worker yields:

wðuÞ  bc
1 þ bc

rðuÞ
hðuÞ ¼ b

acðuÞ
amin





:

Since acðuÞ is increasing in productivity, more productive ﬁrms pay higher wages. Due
to the complementarity between average worker ability and productivity, more
productive ﬁrms have a stronger incentive to be more selective, hire workers with
higher ability and pay them higher wages. Moreover, since wages are proportional to
revenue, which jumps at the export cut-off u ¼ u
x, the model implies an exporter
wage premium. More precisely, the wage paid by ﬁrms with productivity φ can be
written as:

wðuÞ ¼ ð1 þ Is1 rÞkð1 bÞ

dCwðuÞ:

As shown in HIR, the wages of workers employed by domestic ﬁrms and exporters
follow Pareto distributions with shape parameter:

27 This correlation is positive in the cross-section, but not when controlling for industry ﬁxed-effects, due

to the limited time variation in educational attainment.

28 In turn, the skill distribution can react endogenously, as in Bonﬁglioli and Gancia (2014), generating an

interesting complementarity between worker and ﬁrm heterogeneity.

which is decreasing in v. Thus, heterogeneity in productivity maps into wage
dispersion. This allows us to state the following Proposition on the impact of trade
on wage inequality.

PROPOSITION 4. More openness unambiguously raises sectoral wage dispersion among
workers employed by domestic ﬁrms and among workers employed by exporters. Conditional on not
changing export status, more openness increases wage inequality between workers employed by any
pair of ﬁrms with different productivity.

Similar results can also be derived for the wage distribution conditional on ability, a.
Higher ability workers have higher average wages because they are hired by ﬁrms that
have on average a higher productivity. They also face higher inequality, since they can
be hired by ﬁrms in a wider range of productivity. Moreover, following HIR (2008), it
can be shown that the wage of workers employed by domestic ﬁrms is a truncated
Pareto with a shape parameter decreasing in v. However, since in the model ability is
unobservable, the predictions on wage inequality conditional on ability are difﬁcult to
take to the data.

Before concluding, it is important to highlight the differences between our result
and HIR. In HIR and some other existing models, trade affects wage dispersion
through the exporter wage premium. The sign of the effect then depends on the
fraction of exporters. As long as exporters are a minority, trade increases wage
dispersion by raising the share of ﬁrms paying high wages. Once exporters are a
majority, instead, trade decreases wage dispersion by pushing low-wage domestic ﬁrms
out and making the surviving ﬁrms more equal. Thus, the overall effect of trade on
inequality is inverted U-shaped. This effect is present also in our model. But there is
now another, potentially more powerful, force: by making all ﬁrms more unequal,
trade is changing the slope of the entire wage schedule. This second effect, which is
absent in HIR, implies that trade now increases wage inequality within exporters,
within non-exporters, and also between the two groups of ﬁrms.

5. A Further Look at the Evidence

Having studied the theoretical model, we now turn again to the data to test some of its
predictions. We start by focusing on the implications for wage inequality. We show that,
consistently with the theory, export opportunities make the distribution of wages more
dispersed in a panel of US industries. Next, we probe deeper into the mechanism
linking trade, innovation and ﬁrm heterogeneity.

5.1. Wage Dispersion and Export Opportunities

We start our analysis by documenting how wage inequality varies across industries and
time. Our ﬁrst measure of wage dispersion is the standard deviation of log hourly
wages. As detailed in the Appendix, we construct this variable using individual-level
wage data from the CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups for the years 1997, 2002

and 2007. For each year, we compute the standard deviation of log wages in 74
industries, deﬁned according to the Census industry classiﬁcation. We next compute a
measure of residual wage dispersion after controlling for differences in observable
worker characteristics. To this end, we follow Helpman et al. (2016) and run Mincer
wage regressions of log wages on a large set of covariates, separately for each year to
allow for changes in the effects of these characteristics over time. Then, we use the
residuals from these regressions to construct the standard deviation of log residual
wages in each industry and year. The residual component explains the majority (60%)
of the variance of log wages in 2007 and essentially all (97%) of its growth between
1997 and 2007.29 Besides its relevance in explaining overall wage inequality, residual
inequality is closely related to our model, in which wages do not depend on observable
characteristics of workers.

The upper part of Table 5 reports descriptive statistics on the dispersion of wages
and residual wages in the US manufacturing sector. In the ﬁrst four columns, we show
the average, minimum and maximum value of both standard deviations across the 74
industries in 2007. We also report the average percentage change in each standard
deviation between 1997 and 2007. The standard deviation of log wages equals 0.54 and
that of residual wages 0.43,
implying that wage dispersion is smaller than sales
dispersion. Similarly to sales dispersion, wage dispersion exhibits large variation across

Notes. The standard deviations are computed for 74 Census industries using worker-level data and are
weighted by the number of full-time equivalent hours of labour supply. The sample consists of workers aged
18–64. Residual wages are obtained from yearly Mincer regressions of log hourly wages on log age, log age
squared and dummies for race, gender, type of job, country of birth, educational level, union membership,
full-time/part-time status, 3-digit occupations, Census industries and states. The mean, minimum and
maximum values of the standard deviations are computed across the 74 industries in the year 2007; the
percentage changes are computed separately for each industry over 1997–2007, and then averaged across the
74 industries. The unreported between component of the variance decomposition is equal to 1 minus the
within component. The bottom part of the Table reports percentage changes in the standard deviations
computed on the top 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of the wage distributions.

industries, with the maximum exceeding the minimum by more than three times.
Table 5 also conﬁrms the substantial increase in the US wage inequality documented in
previous studies. In particular, the standard deviation of log wages and residual wages
rose by 12% and 16%, respectively, between 1997 and 2007.

In the next two columns, we perform a variance decomposition exercise analogous
to that in Helpman et al. (2016). We decompose the total variance of log wages into
a within-industry and a between-industry component and show the percentage
contribution of the former to the level (in 2007) and growth (between 1997 and
2007) of this variance. This exercise conﬁrms the well-known fact that wage inequality
and its growth are not explained by dispersion of wages between industries but rather
by wage dispersion within industries: the within-industry component accounts for 89%
of the variance of log wages, and within-industry changes in wage inequality explain
essentially all of the increase in the variance of wages over the sample period.

In the bottom part of Table 5, we study how wage inequality changed between 1997
and 2007 across different parts of the wage distribution. To this purpose, we compute
the average percentage change in the standard deviations of log wages and residual
wages after excluding observations in the left tail of each wage distribution. Moving
from left to right in the Table, we restrict consideration to the top 20%, 40%, 60% and
80% of the distribution. These exercises show that the increase in wage inequality
remains
low-wage
individuals. This suggests that the recent rise in US wage inequality corresponds to a
widening of the entire distribution, a result also found in Song et al. (2015).

shares of

Next, we study how the dispersion of wages relates to industry characteristics. To this
end, we regress the standard deviation of log residual wages on covariates, using the
same sample of 6-digit NAICS industries employed in Section 1. We link the Census
industries to 6-digit NAICS codes using correspondence tables from the US Census
Bureau. Because we attribute the wage dispersion of each Census industry to all 6-digit
NAICS codes corresponding to it, we weight the regressions so as to give less weight to
smaller industries; as weights, we use the 1997 shares of the 6-digit industries in total
manufacturing employment. As in Helpman et al. (2016), we restrict attention to
residual wage dispersion, which is closer to the model. Nevertheless, using the standard
deviation of log hourly wages yields similar results, which are not reported to save
space.

Consistently with the theory, our data show that there is a strong positive correlation
between the standard deviation of log establishment sales and the standard deviations
of log residual wages. In particular, regressing the former variable on the latter yields a
coefﬁcient (SE) of 0.821 (0.322). This result echoes recent ﬁrm-level evidence,
according to which the dispersions of productivity and wages are positively correlated
across US ﬁrms (Barth et al., 2014). However, given that the dispersion of sales is
endogenous, we now focus on its main determinants. We are especially interested in
how trade affects inequality, since the model suggests export opportunities to raise
wage dispersion.

The results are reported in Table 6. We start with a pooled regression including all
the controls used in Table 2. Interestingly, residual wage dispersion covaries with
industry characteristics in a way that mirrors well the pattern found for the dispersion
of sales. In particular, residual wage inequality tends to correlate positively with average

Notes. The dependent variable is the standard deviation of log residual hourly wages. This variable is computed
for 74 Census industries using worker-level data, and is weighted by the number of full-time equivalent hours of
labour supply. The sample consists of workers aged 18–64. Residual wages are obtained from yearly Mincer
regressions of log hourly wages on log age, log age squared and dummies for race, gender, type of job, country
of birth, educational
level, union membership, full-time/part-time status, 3-digit occupations, Census
industries and states. The 74 Census industries are mapped into the corresponding 6-digit NAICS industries
using correspondence tables from the US Census Bureau. All variables except for GDP growth are observed at
the 6-digit NAICS industry level
industry-level controls are
contemporaneous to the dependent variable. GDP growth is computed over the two years prior to each
observation. The speciﬁcations in columns (1)–(4) are estimated with ordinary least squares, those in columns
(5)–(6) with two-stage least squares. Export intensity is instrumented with non-US exports to the destination
markets of the US for each industry and year. All regressions are weighted with the shares of the 6-digit NAICS
industries in total manufacturing employment in 1997. Standard errors are clustered by 6-digit industry and

wage dispersion and export intensity do not display an inverted U-shaped pattern. In
column (3), we add industry ﬁxed effects and in column (4), we further take variables
in ﬁrst differences to account for industry-speciﬁc trends. The export intensity
coefﬁcient remains positive and precisely estimated also in these speciﬁcations.

Finally, in columns (5) and (6), we use two-stage least squares. As before, we
instrument export intensity with non-US countries’ exports to the destination markets
of the US.30 The coefﬁcient on export intensity remains positive and precisely
estimated. To conclude, the evidence presented so far paints a consistent picture,
suggesting that the distribution of sales and residual wages behave similarly in a panel
of US industries and that export opportunities have made both distributions more
spread out.

5.2. Trade, Innovation Intensity and Firm Heterogeneity

links export
In this subsection, we provide evidence on the mechanism that
opportunities to the dispersion of sales. In our model, export opportunities raise
expected proﬁts in the tail of the productivity distribution and this induces ﬁrms to
invest in technologies with higher costs and more dispersed outcomes. We now show
that speciﬁc predictions of this mechanisms are that:

(i) more export opportunities lead to an increase in the share of revenue invested

in innovation; and

(ii) a higher investment in innovation is associated with more heterogeneity across

ﬁrms.

We then provide a ﬁrst attempt at testing these predictions.
Since aggregate proﬁts must cover exactly the aggregate entry cost, we can express

the share of revenue invested in innovation as:

i  p
r

;

where p is average proﬁt and r average revenue made by active ﬁrms. We use i as our
measure of ‘innovation intensity’. To solve for it, note that free entry requires expected
proﬁts to be equal to the entry cost, which can be written as p ¼ ðu=uminÞ1=vkF , where
ðumin
=uÞ1=v is the probability of successful entry. Next, recall that average proﬁt is a
fraction 1/r of average revenue minus average ﬁxed costs, which implies
r ¼ r½p þ f þ fxðu=u
xÞ1=v . Finally, combining these expressions for p and r and
using (12) yields:

i ¼ 1v
1 þ 1

:

(15)

Innovation intensity is a positive function of ς and v only. It follows that a fall in trade
costs, s, affects the share of revenue invested in innovation only through its effect on
the dispersion of productivity, v. Since a fall in trade costs induces ﬁrms to choose

30 Our second identiﬁcation strategy – based on the interaction of bulk weight and oil price – is less suited
in this case because much of the variation in the bulk weight takes place within the 74 Census industries and
does not contribute to identiﬁcation.

technologies with a higher variance, the model predicts export opportunities to have a
positive correlation with innovation intensity. But, this correlation should be zero in a
model in which v is exogenous. Thus, investigating empirically the determinants of
innovation intensity allows us to test a speciﬁc prediction of
the model with
endogenous heterogeneity in productivity.

To make progress, we follow Aghion et al. (2015) and switch from industrial to
geographic data. In publicly available databases, innovation measures are typically
aggregated into a small number of manufacturing sectors, leaving us with insufﬁcient
degrees of freedom.31 Using geographic data, we can instead obtain a measure of
innovation for a wide and long panel of US states. In particular, we proxy for innovation
intensity, i, using the log number of granted utility patents, by year of application, per
1,000 workers in each US state, using patent data sourced from Aghion et al. (2015).32
Patents correlate strongly with R&D expenditure and are well suited to measure
signiﬁcant innovations. To construct a state-level measure of export intensity, we instead
follow Autor et al. (2013) and compute the weighted average of export intensities across
6-digit NAICS industries, using as weights the industries’ shares in the states’
manufacturing employment by year. This measure of export intensity varies across
states due to their different patterns of industrial specialisation. A higher value of export
intensity is thus associated with US states specialising in more export-oriented industries.
We start our analysis by showing that, consistent with the model, innovation intensity
is correlated with export opportunities. The baseline results are reported in Table 7.
To maximise sample size, we use data for all years between 1989 and 2007, the period
for which we observe both innovation and export intensity. Since annual changes in
patent counts are typically noisy, we estimate all speciﬁcations in levels. We report
results for both pooled speciﬁcations, which exploit the whole variation in the data and
speciﬁcations with state ﬁxed effects, which control for unobserved heterogeneity at
the state level and identify the coefﬁcients through within-state variation over time.
Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

factors,

including changes

In column (1), we start with a parsimonious regression of innovation on exports.
The correlation is positive and very precisely estimated, with a t-statistic of 8.0. In
column (2), we add a set of control variables to account for other factors that may
affect innovation intensity. In particular, we include GDP growth to proxy again for
cyclical
for
heterogeneous trends in other observable characteristics across states, we include
two-year changes
the shares of
manufacturing and ﬁnancial sectors in each state’s GDP, and the share of working-
age population with at least a college degree in the state. In this way, we control for the
fact that innovation intensity might increase more in states where access to credit and
skilled labour are growing faster, or in states that are experiencing faster structural
change. Reassuringly, the inclusion of these controls leaves our main coefﬁcient

manufacturing sectors.

32 Utility patents are meant to protect new and useful innovations, and differ from design and plant
patents which protect new product designs or new plants respectively. Thus, utility patents are probably the
best proxy for innovation. They cover 90% of all patents registered at the US patent ofﬁce (USPTO). See
Aghion et al. (2015) for more discussion on this point.

Notes: The dependent variable is the log number of granted utility patents, by year of application, per 1,000
workers in each US state. The sample period is 1989–2007. All variables except for GDP growth are observed
at the state level. Export intensity is obtained as the weighted average of export intensities across 6-digit
NAICS industries; the weights are the industries’ shares in each state’s manufacturing employment in each
year. The other state variables are computed as changes over the two years prior to each observation. All
speciﬁcations are estimated with ordinary least squares. Standard errors are clustered by state and reported in

essentially unchanged. Next, we re-estimate the last speciﬁcation replacing the current
value of export intensity with its ﬁrst lag as, for some patents, the innovation process
could have started in the previous year triggered by past export opportunities. The
results, reported in column (3), are very similar to the baseline speciﬁcation and
continue to highlight a strong positive association between innovation and export
intensity. In columns (4)–(6), we repeat the previous speciﬁcations controlling for
state ﬁxed effects. The coefﬁcient on export intensity slightly drops but remains very
precisely estimated.

In Table 8, we take a step towards sorting out causality by re-estimating all
speciﬁcations with two-stage least squares. To construct an instrument that varies across
states and over time, we follow the same procedure used in the construction of export
intensity. In particular, we compute the weighted average of our industry-level
instrument using industries’ employment shares as weights. Because innovation may
affect the industrial composition of state employment, we use ﬁve-year lags rather than
current values of the employment shares, so as to mitigate endogeneity concerns. The
resulting instrument attributes stronger demand shocks to states that are specialised in
industries where non-US exports to the US destination markets grow faster.33 The

33 We have also computed state-speciﬁc bulk weights using a similar approach. This variable varies little
across states because industries with high bulk weights are active in most states with similar employment
shares. We therefore lack sufﬁcient cross-sectional variation to identify the effect of oil price shocks.

number of observations drops because the bilateral trade data used to construct the
instrument are available since 1995. The ﬁrst-stage results conﬁrm that the instrument
is strongly correlated with export intensity. At the same time, the second-stage
estimates conﬁrm that export intensity has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on
innovation. Noting that export and innovation intensity have standard deviations of
0.3 and 0.68, respectively, our coefﬁcients of roughly 1.5 imply that a 1 SD increase in
export intensity leads to a 0.66 SD increase in innovation intensity.

Finally, we study the relation between innovation and ﬁrm heterogeneity and show
that higher innovation intensity is associated with greater sales dispersion across ﬁrms.
The results are reported in Table 9. The dependent variable is sales dispersion in a
state and year, our proxy for v, obtained by averaging at the state level the standard
deviations of log establishment sales across industries, using industries’ employment
shares in each state and year as weights. We start, in column (1), with a parsimonious
speciﬁcation using innovation intensity as the only regressor. The speciﬁcation is
estimated on 153 observations, corresponding to 51 states in 1997, 2002 and 2007. We
control for state ﬁxed effects and correct the standard errors for clustering within

Notes. The dependent variable is sales dispersion (the standard deviation of log establishment sales) in each
state and year. The sample period consists of the years 1997, 2002 and 2007. Sales dispersion and export
intensity in a state and year are obtained as the weighted average of the corresponding variables across 6-digit
NAICS industries; the weights are the industries’ shares in the state’s manufacturing employment in that year.
The number of patents is expressed per 1,000 workers. The other state variables are computed as changes
over the two years prior to each observation. All speciﬁcations are estimated with ordinary least squares
and include state ﬁxed effects. Standard errors are clustered by state and reported in parentheses.

states. Then, in column (2), we include additional controls. Consistent with the model,
higher innovation intensity is associated with a more dispersed distribution of sales.
Next, we regress sales dispersion on export intensity, included either alone (column 3)
or together with innovation intensity (column 4). While the coefﬁcient on innovation
intensity is largely stable, the coefﬁcient on export intensity drops in magnitude and
precision when controlling for patent count, suggesting that the effect of export
opportunities on the sales distribution may occur through innovation.

6. Conclusions

In this article, we make several contributions to the literature. First, we document some
little-known facts regarding how ﬁrm heterogeneity varies across US sectors and over
time. We ﬁnd that the standard deviation of log sales across establishments correlates
systematically with industry characteristics, especially export opportunities, and has
increased signiﬁcantly over time. Second, we propose one possible explanation, based
on the idea that ﬁrms can affect the variance of their productivity at the entry stage.
The model formalises the idea that ﬁrms can choose between larger innovation
projects with more dispersed outcomes, and smaller but less variable projects. It shows
that export opportunities, by reallocating proﬁts to the most productive ﬁrms, increase
the return to technological heterogeneity and induce ﬁrms to bet on more ambitious
project. Third, we explore the implications for wage inequality and ﬁnd a new channel
through which trade liberalisation can affect the entire wage distribution and increase

its dispersion. Fourth, we ﬁnd evidence that the distribution of wages varies across US
industries and time in a way that mirrors well the distribution of ﬁrms’ sales. Finally, we
use patent data for a panel of US states to provide a ﬁrst attempt at testing a key
mechanism of our model, namely, that export opportunities increase ﬁrm hetero-
geneity by fostering innovation.

Our analysis could be extended in several directions. In a companion paper
(Bonﬁglioli et al., 2016), we use a similar model to study how ﬁnancial frictions affect
ﬁrm-level heterogeneity and trade. By softening competition and lowering the exit cut-
off, ﬁnancial frictions lower the value of investing in bigger projects with more
dispersed outcomes and hence compress equilibrium heterogeneity, especially in more
ﬁnancially vulnerable industries. We provide strong support for this prediction using
cross-country indicators of credit supply interacted with cross-sector proxies for
ﬁnancial vulnerability and measuring sales dispersion from highly disaggregated US
import data. Despite the completely different empirical strategies and data, the
evidence in these two papers is strikingly consistent.

To focus on one mechanism shaping the equilibrium distribution of ﬁrms and
preserve analytical tractability, we abstract from ﬁrm dynamics and ex post innovation.
Yet, our approach could be applied to innovation strategies of existing ﬁrms. Making
the model dynamic, for instance along the lines of Gabler and Poschke (2013) or
Arkolakis (2015), would also allow to study quantitative implications and transitional
adjustments. Within our theory, we also restrict the attention to positive implications.
Yet, the model suggests interesting normative questions: is equilibrium heterogeneity
too high, especially if workers are risk averse and insurance markets are imperfect?
Does international trade introduce new externalities in the technology choice at the
entry stage? Finally, our look at the data uncovers a number of new ﬁndings, but more
can be done to deepen our understanding of how and why productivity and wages vary
across ﬁrms, sectors and time.

Appendix A. Data

Here, we provide details on data sources and variable deﬁnitions.

A.1. Dispersion of Sales and Labour Productivity

The dispersion of sales and labour productivity are computed with Census data drawn from the
‘Statistics of US Businesses’. For Census years 1997, 2002 and 2007, the database contains
receipts of sales and number of establishments and employees, disaggregated by industry and
sales-size category. The publicly available data aggregate conﬁdential establishment-level
information from the Business Registry, which covers the universe of establishments with paid
employees in the US. The number of sales-size bins is equal to 10 for 1997, 8 for 2002 and 18 for
2007. The lowest bin contains ﬁrms with revenue smaller than 50,000 US$ while the highest bin
contains ﬁrms with revenue larger than 100 million US$. In our main analysis, we aggregate the
data into six bins consistently deﬁned over the sample period. They refer to ﬁrms with US$
revenue of: (1) <100,000; (2) 100,000–499,999; (3) 500,000–999,999; (4) 1,000,000–4,999,999;

Census Bureau (between different versions of the NAICS classiﬁcation). For each industry, year
and bin, we observe total sales and number of establishments and employees, so we can compute
average sales per establishment and average sales per worker in each industry-year-bin triplet.
Then, we compute the dispersion of sales in each industry and year as the standard deviation of
log average sales per establishment across the six bins, weighting the observations with the
number of establishments in each bin. The standard deviation of log labour productivity (sales
per worker) is computed analogously.

A.2. Dispersion of Wages and Educational Attainment

type of

race, gender,

To construct the standard deviations of log hourly wages and log hourly residual wages, we
use individual-level data from the CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups (CPS-MORG). We
focus on working-age individuals (18–64 years old) and compute hourly wages as weekly
earnings divided by the usual number of hours worked per week. Residual wages are the
log age squared and
residuals from yearly Mincer regressions of log wages on log age,
dummies
for
level, union
membership,
full-time/part-time status, 3-digit occupations, Census industries and states.
With this data in hand, we compute the yearly standard deviations of log wages and log
residual wages for 74 Census industries, consistently deﬁned over the sample period; both
standard deviations are weighted with full-time equivalent hours of labour supply as in Autor
et al. (2003). We map the 74 Census industries into the 6-digit NAICS industries using
correspondence tables from the US Census Bureau. We proceed similarly to construct the
mean of educational attainment and the standard deviation of log education across workers.
Education is a discrete variable ranging from 1 to 16, with higher values corresponding to
more advanced degrees.

job, country of birth, educational

A.3. Export Intensity

Export intensity is the ratio of exports to total shipments in a given industry and year. Shipment
data come from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Productivity Database. Export data are
sourced from Schott (2008). For the years 1989–2005, the data are provided by 6-digit NAICS
industry and destination country. For later years, they are instead disaggregated by destination
and product (10-digit HS), so we compute industry-level bilateral exports by summing exports
across all products belonging to a given industry and exported to a given destination. After
excluding 144 observations with exports greater than total shipments, our ﬁnal data set contains
export intensity for 375 6-digit NAICS industries over 1989–2007.

A.4. Instrument

We instrument export intensity using the sum of exports from all non-US countries to the
destination markets of the US in each industry and year. To construct the instrument, we use
data on bilateral exports from BACI, available since 1995 at the HS 6-digit product level. We
convert these data into 6-digit NAICS industries using correspondence tables from the World
Integrated Trade Solution and the US Census Bureau.

A.5. Bulk Weight and Oil Price

We construct industry-level bulk weights (expressed in kg per US$) as the export-weighted
average of individual products’ bulk weights across air and vessel shipments in 1995. We source

data from Schott (2008). We combine the bulk weights with data on oil price (Brent) from FRED
(Federal Reserve of St. Louis).

A.6. Patents

To construct our measure of innovation intensity, we use the number of granted utility patents,
by year of application, in each US state and year. The original data are sourced from Aghion et al.
(2015) and are available for the period 1970–2009. The data contain information on all patents
registered at the US Patent Ofﬁce (USPTO); each patent is located to the state where its inventor
works or lives. We normalise patent counts by total employment in each state and year, sourced
from the County Business Patterns (CBS).

A.7. Other Variables

The number of establishments and workers in each industry and year come from the ‘Statistics of
US Businesses’. Factor intensities are computed as in Romalis (2004) using data from the NBER-
CES Manufacturing Industry Productivity Database. Material intensity is equal to material costs
divided by material costs plus value added. Capital intensity is computed as 1 minus material
intensity, times the non-labour share of valued added.

We construct sales dispersion, export intensity and the instrument for each US state and year
as the weighted average of these variables across 6-digit NAICS industries. The weights are given
by the industries’ shares in each state’s manufacturing employment by year. We obtain yearly
information on the industrial composition of state employment from the CBS. For some state-
industry-year cells, employment
is not disclosed for conﬁdentiality reasons. To estimate
employment in these cells, we use information on the number of establishments in nine
employment-size bins, available for each industry and year from the CBS. We ﬁrst estimate
employment in each bin as the product between the number of establishments in the bin and
the mid-point of the bin itself. Then, we sum the results across bins to obtain an estimate of total
employment in the state-industry-year cell.

Data on state population and GDP by sector come from the regional accounts of the BEA. The
number of bank deposits in each state and year is instead sourced from the ‘USA Counties
Database’. Finally, the share of working-age population with at least a college degree in each state
and year is constructed with educational attainment data from the CPS-MORG, weighting the
individual observations with full-time equivalent hours of labour supply.

Appendix B. A Simple Case with Closed-form Solutions
To guarantee v < 1/ς, assume that j = aς with a > 1 and s 2 (0, 1]. The ﬁrst assumption implies
that quality of potential ideas is more dispersed in an industry producing more differentiated
varieties. This is intuitive: there is little scope for technological differences between very
homogeneous products. The second assumption normalises the size of the largest project to one.
Then, v = s/(aς). The parameter a > 1 pins down the upper bound to v: v ¼ 1=ða1Þ. Next,
assume that the entry cost is proportional to s/(1   s), which is increasing and tends to inﬁnity
as s approaches the maximum size. Thus, F(v) = vaς/(1   vaς). Substituting F(v) and v = s/(aς)
into (9) yields:

Note that f/k > a guarantees that (B.1) has a unique interior solution for s. Since v = s/(aς), the
log of revenue has a standard deviation equal to s/a.

Appendix C. Mean-preserving Spreads
We now solve the model under the assumption that umin ¼ uð1   vÞ so that the mean of the
distribution is constant at u and an increase in v corresponds to a mean-preserving spread.
Although the model in the main text suggests that the mean and the variance of productivity are
likely to be linked, our goal here is to show that the main results in the aarticle do not change if
ﬁrms can only choose the variance of their initial draw.
Using the expression for @ ln EðpÞ=@ ln v derived in the text, the ﬁrst-order condition for the
problem maxv2½v;vfEðpÞ   kFðvÞg becomes:

"

Imposing free-entry, EðpÞ ¼ kFðvÞ, yields the same expression for the exit cut-off, u=umin.
Using these results in the new ﬁrst-order condition yields:

FðvÞ :

This equation, which pins down implicitly the equilibrium v, is identical to (9), except for the new
term  1/(1   v) on the left-hand side. Intuitively, the fact that a higher variance is not associated
with higher expected productivity draw lowers the value of v. This immediately implies that ﬁrms
will choose a lower equilibrium level of v. However, the comparative statics for all the parameters are
unchanged. Moreover, revenue, r(φ), is still Pareto distributed with c.d.f. GrðrÞ ¼ 1   ðrmin=rÞ1=v1,
for r [ rmin ¼ rf as in the benchmark case. Hence, all the results in Proposition 1 still hold.
umin ¼ uð1   vÞ yields:

This expression for the return to risk is again, is identical to (11), except for the new term
 1/(1   v) on the left-hand side.
Imposing free-entry, EðpÞ ¼ kFðvÞ, yields the same expression (12) for the exit cut-off, u=umin.
Then, the effect of openness, q, on the value of risk, as captured by @2 ln EðpÞ=@ ln v@q is identical

to (13). Following the same steps as in autarky, the equilibrium v is implicitly determined by:
1=v   1

Once again, the lower value of technological variability (the new term  1/(1   v) on the left-
hand side) implies the ﬁrms will draw from less dispersed distributions, but the effect of
openness and other parameters on the choice of v is qualitatively unchanged.
