Abstract

This paper estimates the incidence of corporate taxes on wages using a 20-year

panel of German municipalities exploiting 6,800 tax changes for identiﬁcation. Using

event study designs and diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences models, we ﬁnd that workers bear

about half of the total tax burden. Administrative linked employer-employee data

allow us to estimate heterogeneous ﬁrm and worker eﬀects. Our ﬁndings highlight

the importance of labor market institutions and proﬁt-shifting opportunities for the

incidence of corporate taxes on wages. Moreover, we show that low-skilled, young

and female employees bear a larger share of the tax burden. This has important

distributive implications.

Introduction

The incidence of corporate taxation is a key issue in tax policy debates. The distribution of

the tax burden between labor and capital has important implications for the progressivity

of the tax system. According to surveys, most people think that capital owners bear the
burden of corporate taxation.1 Business lobbyists, in contrast, argue that the tax reduces

investment so that labor productivity and wages decline, which means that workers bear

the tax burden. Most economists take a middle ground and think that the tax burden

is shared between labor and capital. Yet, even among researchers in the ﬁeld, there is
substantial disagreement about how much of the burden is shifted to workers.2 The main

reason is that credible empirical evidence on the causal eﬀect of corporate taxes on wages

is scarce. In this paper, we revisit the question of how corporate taxes aﬀect wages.

We exploit the speciﬁc institutional setting of the German local business tax (LBT)

to identify the corporate tax incidence on wages. The German setting is well-suited for

several reasons. First, there is substantial tax variation at the local level. From 1993

to 2012, on average about 10% of all municipalities adjusted their LBT rates annually,

resulting in 17,999 tax changes in 10,001 municipalities between 1993 and 2012. Second,

municipalities can only change the LBT rate. The tax base deﬁnition and rules about
which types of ﬁrms are liable to the tax are determined at the federal level.3 More-

over, municipal autonomy in setting tax rates allows us to treat municipalities as many

small open economies within the highly integrated German national economy – with high

mobility of capital, labor and goods across municipal borders.

In this setting, general

equilibrium eﬀects on interest rates or consumer prices, which may complicate measuring

the incidence of the tax on workers, are likely to be of minor importance.

Our analysis combines administrative panel data on the universe of German mu-

nicipalities with administrative linked employer-employee micro data from social security

records. In this data, we observe ﬁrms in 3,522 municipalities, leaving us with 6,802 tax

changes for identiﬁcation. We use non-parametric event study designs to show that wages

decrease signiﬁcantly after tax increases. At the same time, they do not react in the

periods prior to a tax reform. In addition, we use the event study set-up to show that

tax reforms are not driven by local business cycles. These ﬂat pre-trends support our

identifying assumption and the causal interpretation of our estimates.

1See, e.g., Sheﬀrin (1994) and various Gallup polls: http://www.gallup.com/poll/1714/taxes.aspx.
2 For example, public economists surveyed by Fuchs, Krueger and Poterba (1998) respond on average
that 40% of the corporate tax incidence is on capital, leaving a substantial share of the burden for labor
(and land owners or consumers). However, one quarter of the surveyed economists believed that the
capital share is below 20%, while another quarter believed the share to be 65% or higher.

3 Kawano and Slemrod (2016) compare a large number of reforms of nationwide corporate taxes and

show that tax rate changes are usually combined with changes in the tax base as well.

1

We then estimate diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences (DiD) models to quantify the magnitude

of the wage response. Averaging over all ﬁrms liable to the LBT, we ﬁnd that workers
bear approximately 51% of the total tax burden.4 Our ﬁndings are robust to the inclusion

of a comprehensive set of ﬂexible non-parametric local controls at diﬀerent aggregation

levels, suggesting that potentially relevant omitted variables such as local shocks are not

driving the results. Finally, we estimate various heterogeneous ﬁrm and worker eﬀects

and discuss the results with regard to diﬀerent (labor market) theories.

We contribute to the literature in several ways. We provide new estimates of the cor-

porate tax incidence on wages by exploiting the compelling German institutional setting.

So far, credible empirical evidence on the incidence of corporate taxes has been scarce

because suﬃcient and exogenous variation in corporate tax rates is lacking in previous

studies. While cross-country research designs (such as Hassett and Mathur, 2006; Felix,

2007; Desai, Foley and Hines, 2007; Clausing, 2013; Az´emar and Hubbard, 2015) need to

defend their (implicit or explicit) common trend assumptions, single-country designs can

establish a valid control group more easily. Most existing single-country studies (see, e.g.,

Dwenger, Rattenhuber and Steiner, 2011; Arulampalam, Devereux and Maﬃni, 2012; Liu

and Altshuler, 2013), however, have to rely on variation in the tax burden that is not

solely driven by policy reforms but also by ﬁrms’ choices. For instance, diﬀerences in tax

burdens across industries or across regions due to formula apportionment may depend

directly on sales and investment activities, which may be endogenous to tax rates. The

contribution of our paper is to exploit substantial within-country variation in statutory

municipal tax rates. In a recent contribution, Su´arez Serrato and Zidar (2016) estimate

the incidence of U.S. state-level corporate taxes using a spatial equilibrium framework
exploiting regional variation in tax rates and apportionment rules.5 The German setting

has the advantage to oﬀer substantially larger variation in terms of both number and size

of tax rate changes.

Furthermore, we go beyond a cleanly identiﬁed average eﬀect of corporate taxes on

wages and analyze the economic factors driving these changes. We estimate heteroge-

neous ﬁrm eﬀects and discuss the results in light of diﬀerent labor market theories and

tax incidence mechanisms. The German labor market, with its variety of wage-setting in-

stitutions, is particularly useful for this exercise. Exploiting the rich administrative linked

employer-employee data, we ﬁnd that labor market institutions matter for the incidence

4 We observe only very few nominal wage decreases in the data but rather smaller wage increases

leading to lower future wage levels in the treated municipalities.

5 Felix and Hines (2009) also use U.S. state tax variation but rely on cross-sectional data. Bauer,
Kasten and Siemers (2012) also investigate the German LBT but without using linked employer-employee
data. Moreover, as in an earlier version of this paper (Fuest, Peichl and Siegloch, 2011), they have to
average tax rates at the county level (consisting of 28 municipalities on average) which leads to biased
results.

of corporate taxes on wages. In particular and in line with Felix and Hines (2009) and

Arulampalam, Devereux and Maﬃni (2012), collective bargaining agreements play a key

role: If wages are set via collective bargaining at the ﬁrm level, wage responses are larger

than in cases where wages are set at the sector level or without collective bargaining.

Overall, our results suggest that the higher the rents to be shared between ﬁrms and

workers, the higher the pass-through on wages. For instance, wages are more sensitive

to tax changes in more proﬁtable ﬁrms. However, we ﬁnd that wage eﬀects are close

to zero for very large ﬁrms, foreign-owned ﬁrms and for ﬁrms that operate in multiple

jurisdictions. This can be explained by better proﬁt-shifting capabilities of these ﬁrms.

In general, the interaction of labor market institutions, avoidance opportunities and tax

rates has received little attention in the literature on the incidence of corporate taxes,

both theoretically and empirically. Our heterogeneous ﬁrm eﬀects show that such inter-

actions aﬀect wage responses. This has implications beyond the German setting. While

labor market institutions diﬀer internationally, most countries exhibit a mixture of union-

ized and non-unionized ﬁrms or sectors, so that the heterogeneous eﬀects we ﬁnd in our

setting are likely to be relevant in many other countries as well. This is also true for the

diﬀerences between ﬁrm types, in particular the ﬁnding that higher taxes do not seem to

reduce wages in ﬁrms with proﬁt-shifting opportunities.

Last, we add to the distributional debate about the burden of corporate taxation. By

estimating the tax incidence for heterogeneous worker groups we show that higher taxes

reduce wages most for the low-skilled, women, and young workers. Both the average

pass-through on wages of 51% and the heterogeneous worker eﬀects are important for tax

policy because they qualify the widespread view that the corporate income tax is highly

progressive. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on Piketty and Saez (2007), we

show that the estimated progressivity of the overall tax systems in both Germany and

the U.S. would decrease by 25-40% if we account for our incidence estimates.

Our analysis focuses on the corporate tax incidence on workers and therefore on

the causal wage response to corporate tax changes. We do not investigate the impact

on input factors, production levels, ﬁrm entry or exit. Studying these other margins is

important to understand the overall eﬃciency costs of corporate taxes. Such an analysis

would, however, be complicated by data (linkage) limitations and is beyond the scope of

this paper.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the in-

stitutional setting of business taxation in Germany and introduce the datasets used in

the empirical analysis. The empirical model is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we

present our main estimates of the corporate tax incidence on wages. Section 5 provides ev-

idence on heterogeneous worker and ﬁrm eﬀects which we discuss with respect to diﬀerent

3

theoretical models and mechanisms. Section 6 concludes.

Institutional background and data

We estimate the incidence of corporate taxes on wages by exploiting the particular features

of the German business tax system. We describe this system in Subsection 2.1, with a

special emphasis on the local business tax (LBT, Gewerbesteuer ).

In Subsection 2.2,

we document the cross-sectional and time variation of the LBT. In Subsection 2.3, we

introduce the administrative linked employer-employee data set, while Subsection 2.4

contains the deﬁnition of our estimation sample and descriptive statistics.

2.1 Business taxation in Germany

There are three taxes on business proﬁts in Germany: the municipal LBT as well as

the corporate income tax (CIT, K¨orperschaftsteuer ) and the personal income tax (PIT,

Einkommensteuer ) which are both set by the federal government. In the following, we

describe the LBT, while the CIT and PIT are described in Appendix B.1.

The LBT applies to both corporate and non-corporate ﬁrms, but most ﬁrms in
the agricultural and public sector are not liable.6 The tax base of the LBT is basically
operating proﬁts. The cost of debt ﬁnancing is deductible, with some limitations7, and the

cost of equity ﬁnancing is not. Taxable proﬁts of ﬁrms with establishments in more than

one municipality are divided between municipalities according to formula apportionment

based on the payroll share. Importantly, the local government can change the tax rate

but neither the tax base nor the liability criteria. Both are set at the federal level.

The tax rate, τLBT , consists of two components: the basic rate (Steuermesszahl ),
tf ed
LBT , which is set at the federal level, and a local scaling factor (Hebesatz ), θmun
LBT , which
is set at the municipal level. Each year, the municipal council votes on next year’s θmun
LBT
– even if it remains unchanged. The total LBT rate is given by τLBT = tf ed
LBT . From
1993 to 2007, tf ed
LBT was 5.0% and decreased to 3.5% in 2008. For example, for the median
θmun
LBT of 3.9, τLBT was 19.5% before 2008. In the empirical analysis, we rely on variation
in τLBT induced by changes in θmun

LBT · θmun

LBT (described next).

6 To be precise, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the LBT law (Gewerbesteuergesetz ) regulate which ﬁrms are
exempt from the LBT. The main criteria are interactions of legal form and industry. Moreover, certain
professions such as accountants, lawyers, journalists or physicians are exempt.

7 A special feature of the LBT is that 25% of interest costs are added to the tax base. Another

peculiarity is that until 2007, the LBT itself was deductible as an expense.

2.2 Municipal data and tax rate variation

We use administrative statistics provided by the Statistical Oﬃces of the 16 German fed-

eral states (Statistische Landesaemter ) on the ﬁscal situation of all 11,441 municipalities.
Most importantly, the dataset contains information on θmun
LBT , but also on population, mu-
nicipal spending and revenues. In addition, we observe county (Kreis) level GDP as well

as unemployment rates compiled by the German federal employment agency.

We combined and harmonized the annual state-speciﬁc datasets and constructed

a panel on the universe of all municipalities from 1993 to 2012. In the administrative

wage data (see Section 2.3), we can identify municipalities according to their boundaries

as of 2010. Due to mergers, various municipal borders predominantly in East Germany

changed prior to 2010. As we cannot assign the exact LBT rate for aﬀected jurisdictions,

we exclude all municipalities that underwent a municipal merger between 1993 and 2010

from our baseline sample. This concerns 47% of East German and 0.6% of West German
municipalities.8 Overall, there are 10,001 non-merged municipalities in Germany.

Figure 1 visualizes the substantial cross-sectional and time variation in LBT rates.

The left panel of the ﬁgure shows the cross-sectional variation in τLBT for the year 2003,
the mid-year of our sample.9 Appendix Table C.1 provides measures of the distribution of
θmun
LBT over time. The right panel of Figure 1 illustrates this time variation by showing the
number of changes in θmun
LBT per municipality during the period 1993–2012 (Appendix Table
C.2 shows the corresponding numbers). Overall, 19% of the non-merged municipalities did
not change θmun
LBT during the 20-year period. More than half of the jurisdictions changed it
once or twice, and only 7.5% experienced 4 or more changes. In total, we observe 17,999

tax rate changes in 10,001 non-merged municipalities.

8 East German municipalities were rather small after reuniﬁcation in 1990 and were subsequently
merged (sometimes several times) to bigger jurisdictions. As a sensitivity check, we impute tax rates for
merged municipalities by using weighted averages. See Appendix C for a more detailed discussion of the
jurisdictional changes and Figure C.1 showing the tax rate variation including merged municipalities.

9 The cross-sectional variation reveals some regional clustering: for instance, scaling factors are higher
in the state of North Rhine Westphalia. This is partly due to particularities of that state’s ﬁscal equal-
ization scheme. Empirically, we account for such diﬀerences by including “state × year’ ﬁxed eﬀects.

between 1993 and 2012. White areas are municipalities that underwent a change of boundaries due to
a merger; which are dropped from the baseline sample (see Appendix Figure C.1 for the same graphs
including the dropped municipalities). Jurisdictional boundaries are as of December 31, 2010.

2.3 Linked employer-employee data

We combine the municipal data presented in the previous subsection with linked employer-

employee data (LIAB) provided by the Institute of Employment Research (IAB). The

LIAB combines administrative worker data with ﬁrm-level data (Alda, Bender and Gart-

ner, 2005).

The ﬁrm component of the LIAB is the IAB Establishment Panel (K¨olling, 2000),

which is a 1% stratiﬁed random sample of all German establishments. The term estab-

lishment refers to the fact that the observational unit is the individual plant, not the

ﬁrm. The employer data covers establishments with at least one worker subject to social

insurance contributions and contains about 15,000 establishments. We extract the fol-

lowing variables: number of employees, industry, union status (sector- or ﬁrm-level wage
bargaining or no collective agreement), self-rated proﬁtability10, ﬁrm structure (single vs.

10 The survey question asks for a self-assessment of the proﬁt situation. We construct a three-point

scale (high, medium, low) for proﬁtability with well-balanced support over the three categories.

multi-plant ﬁrms), and residence (domestic or foreign) of the owner.

In addition to the establishment-level information, the dataset contains information

on all employees in the sampled establishments. This includes between 1.6 and 2.0 million

workers (corresponding to about 6% of all workers) per year. The employee data is taken

from the administrative employment register of the German Federal Employment Agency

(Bundesagentur f¨ur Arbeit) covering all employees paying social security contributions

(Bender, Haas and Klose, 2000). While civil servants, self-employed individuals and

students are not observed in the social security data, the dataset covers more than 80% of

all employed persons in Germany. The employee information is recorded on June 30th of

each year and includes information on wages, age, gender, occupation, employment type

(full-time or part-time employment) and skill.

Importantly, wages are right-censored at the ceiling for social security contributions

(63,400 euros in 2008 for Western Germany). Up to 13% of the observations are censored

(see Appendix Table C.4 for the distribution of censored workers across ﬁrms). Note

that the censoring does not aﬀect our baseline results at the ﬁrm-level since we use the

median wage in the establishment as our left-hand-side variable. At the individual level,

we opt for a conservative approach and assign censored individuals the cap, leading to an

underestimation of the wage eﬀect.

2.4 Sample deﬁnition and descriptive statistics

We select a ten-year panel of the administrative wage data spanning the years 1999 to

2008 for our analysis. This choice yields a suﬃcient number of years before and after tax

changes, which are necessary to set up the event study design with a window running

from four years prior to ﬁve years after the reform, implying that we need tax data from

1993 (the ﬁrst year available to us) until 2012 (see Section 3 for details on the empirical

model). Furthermore, ending in 2008 avoids potential wage eﬀects of the Great Recession.

As discussed in Section 2.2, we focus on the 10,001 municipalities that did not

change jurisdictional borders between 1993 and 2012.

In the LIAB data, we observe

ﬁrms in 3,522 of those non-merged municipalities. This leaves us with 6,802 tax changes

to identify the eﬀect of corporate taxes on wages. Figure 2 shows the distribution of

these changes. The left panel shows all non-merged municipalities, while the panel on the

right-hand side is based on the non-merged municipalities represented in our estimation

sample. The ﬁgure shows that tax rate variation in both samples is very similar. In both

samples, 93% of the tax changes are increases (see, also, Tables C.2 and C.3, for more
details on the (similarity of the) tax rate variation).11 The mean increase of τLBT is 0.9

11 Given the international trend towards lower corporate tax rates this seems surprising. Yet, both

7

percentage points (or 5%) and the 75th percentile of the tax increase distribution is equal

to 1.1 percentage points (6%). We are therefore able to exploit many and fairly large tax
reforms for identiﬁcation.12

Figure 2: Distribution of local business tax changes

Source: Statistical Oﬃces of the Laender. Notes: The histogram shows the distribution of changes
in the LBT rate induced by changes of the municipal scaling factor from 1993 to 2012 in non-merged
municipalities. In the left panel, the sample consists of all 17,999 tax rate changes in the 10,001 non-
merged municipalities, while in the right panel it is constrained to the 6,802 tax changes in those 3,522
non-merged municipalities represented in the linked employer-employee data (LIAB). In both histograms,
we omit 0.1% of the observations with absolute changes larger than 5 percentage points for illustrative
purposes. The average LBT rate in the full (LIAB) sample is 16.0% (18.7%).

Our estimation sample consist of all ﬁrms in non-merged municipalities observed in

the LIAB data and their corresponding workers. We exclude the few ﬁrms that changed

their incorporation status during the observation period from the baseline since such a

change simultaneously aﬀects the LBT tax base, the applicable business tax at the federal

level (see Appendix B.1) and potentially other ﬁrm characteristics such as ﬁrm scale or

collective bargaining agreements. We also focus on ﬁrms with more than three workers to

be able to calculate meaningful and reliable wage measures at the ﬁrm level. We check the

the federal CIT rate and the top PIT rate decreased in Germany over the period 1993–2012 so that the
overall business tax rate declined as well (see Appendix B.1 for more details). Thus, a rise in the LBT
rates in a municipality over time has to be seen as leading to a slower decrease in the overall tax burden
for ﬁrms in these municipalities compared to ﬁrms in jurisdictions with constant local tax rates.

12 For instance, Su´arez Serrato and Zidar (2016) exploit about 100 corporate tax changes of U.S. states
with an average change (over 10 years) of 1% (and about 20% of changes larger than 2%). Part of their
variation stems from tax base diﬀerences for example due to diﬀerent apportionment rules. Su´arez Serrato
and Zidar (2017) document that tax base rules explain more of the U.S. state corporate tax variation
than tax rates do.

Appendix

Tables C.5 and C.6 present descriptive statistics of our establishment and worker level
sample in non-merged municipalities.13 Table C.5 shows that the average median ﬁrm
wage is 2,733 euros per month. The average θmun
LBT is 3.85, and the average τLBT is 18.7%.
The average (median) establishment has 265 (53) employees. 64% of the establishments

are liable to the LBT. Our baseline estimates presented below will be based on the sample

of liable ﬁrms, while we use the sample of non-liable ﬁrms for a sensitivity check.

Moreover, the descriptive statistics reveal that 62% of the establishments are single-

plant ﬁrms. More than half of the ﬁrms have sector-level bargaining agreements in place,

while about a third have no collective bargaining agreement. The descriptive statistics

of the individual worker sample (see Table C.6) place greater weight on larger ﬁrms with

more employees. As larger ﬁrms pay higher wages, we see that the median wage in

the individual level sample increases to 3,363 euros per month. In terms of individual

characteristics, the table shows that the average worker in our sample is 41 years old.

The share of males is 72%. 14% of the individuals are high-skilled, while about as many
are low-skilled.14 81% of the individuals have never earned a wage higher than the social

security contribution ceiling in our sample.

3 Empirical strategy

3.1 Research design and identiﬁcation

We use diﬀerent empirical models to estimate the causal eﬀect of LBT changes on wages.

Our baseline outcome variable is the log median real full-time wage in ﬁrm f , located in
municipality m, which is part of commuting zone (CZ) c and state s, in year t, wp50
f (m,c,s),t.15
We choose the median as the baseline on the ﬁrm level to account for the top-coding of

wages at the ceiling for social security contributions (see the discussion in Section 2.3).

We start our analysis using an event study design, which formally reads:

ln wp50

f,t =

γjDj

m,t + µf + µm + ψs,t + εf,t.

(1)

5(cid:88)

j=−4

The independent variables of interest are a set of dummies Dj

m,t indicating an event

13 In the baseline, we only consider full-time workers. We also looked at the eﬀects on part-time wages

but found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences (see below).

14 We diﬀerentiate between three skill groups: high-skilled workers who have obtained a col-
lege/university degree; medium-skilled who have completed either vocational training or the highest
high school diploma (Abitur ); low-skilled who have completed neither of the two.

happening j periods away. Following Simon (2016), we estimate diﬀerent speciﬁcations,

where events are either (i) any LBT increase, (ii) large tax increases, or (iii) tax decreases.

Large increases are deﬁned as any tax hike greater than or equal to the 75th percentile

of the tax increase distribution. There are two potential advantages of focusing on large

increases. First, wages might not respond to small tax rate changes, e.g. due to adjustment

costs. Second, we limit the number of events per ﬁrm and reduce the likelihood that other

tax events happened within the event window (Simon, 2016). As an additional sensitivity

check, we estimate the model on a restricted sample of tax changes that have no other

changes in the event window. We set a baseline event window, running from 4 years prior
to a tax change to 5 years after.16 In addition, we include ﬁrm, (µf ), and municipal, (µm),
ﬁxed eﬀects.17 To account for regional shocks, our baseline speciﬁcation includes “state
× year” ﬁxed eﬀects (ψs,t). The error term is denoted by εf,t.

The event study speciﬁcation uses dummy variables to capture tax rate changes. In

order to account for diﬀerent magnitudes of tax changes, we follow Su´arez Serrato and

Zidar (2016) and estimate the following distributed lag model:

ln wp50

f,t − ln wp50

f,t−1 =

βj[ln(1 − τm,t−j) − ln(1 − τm,t−1−j)] + ψs,t + εf,t.

(2)

5(cid:88)

j=−4

We regress the annual change in log wages on the change in the log net-of-business-tax
rate. The estimated coeﬃcients ˆβj measure the eﬀect of leads and lags of a tax rate
change on the annual real wage growth. Time invariant factors are diﬀerenced out. We

use the estimates of the model to calculate the cumulative eﬀect of a tax change.

In both models (1) and (2), identiﬁcation is achieved within ﬁrms and municipalities

over time, and we thus estimate variants of a DiD model with ﬁxed eﬀects. Identiﬁca-

tion of causal eﬀects in such models requires common trends pre-treatment – that is, no

statistically signiﬁcant wage responses preceding a tax reform. While we use speciﬁca-

tions (1) and (2) mainly to establish ﬂat pre-trends, we use the following generalized DiD

model to estimate the average eﬀect of a change in the LBT rate on wages relative to the

pre-treatment period, which we then use to calculate the tax incidence:

ln wp50

f,t = δ ln(1 − τm,t) + µf + µm + ψs,t + εf,t,

16 We experimented with diﬀerent leads and lags, but results are robust to the event window deﬁnition.
As commonly done, we bin up event dummies at the endpoints of the event window (i.e., j = −4 and
j = 5). Hence, the dummy D5
m,t accounts for all reforms occurring ﬁve or more years ago (McCrary,
2007). This is necessary as we have a balanced panel in terms of years (1993-2012), but reform years
diﬀer across municipalities, which yields an unbalanced panel in event time. Because of this, we do not
plot the endpoint estimates in the event study graphs.

17 Firm and municipal ﬁxed eﬀects are highly collinear as only very few ﬁrms move between munici-

palities in the data.

where δ measures the percent change in wages induced by a one percent increase in the

net-of-tax rate.

Given ﬂat pre-trends, our research design would still be invalid if local shocks system-

atically aﬀected tax rates and wages. We provide three further checks to assess whether

such potential local shocks are likely to bias our estimates. First, we run event study de-

signs as speciﬁed in equation (1) using GDP, unemployment, as well as municipal revenues

and spending as outcome variables. Signiﬁcant pre-treatment trends for these outcomes

would hint at local shocks and cast doubt on our identifying assumption. As will be shown

in Section 4, there are no local shocks to the business cycle prior to a tax change. Second,

we further test the sensitivity of the empirical models with respect to local shocks. While
our baseline speciﬁcations include “state × year” ﬁxed eﬀects, which non-parametrically
account for local shocks at the state level, we can control for shocks at diﬀerent levels of

aggregation. We estimate a simpler model using only year ﬁxed eﬀects and a more com-
plex model with “commuting zone × year” ﬁxed eﬀects (there are 258 CZ in Germany).
If confounding local labor market shocks were important, estimates should vary across
diﬀerent speciﬁcations since they should be picked up at least partly by “CZ × year” ﬁxed
eﬀects. Third, besides these non-parametric speciﬁcations, we directly account for local

time-varying confounders by additionally controlling for (lagged) GDP, unemployment,

population, and municipal spending. As will be shown below, our results are robust to

these tests for omitted confounders.

Heterogeneous eﬀects.

In order to test for heterogeneous eﬀects, we interact the

local tax rates in the DiD models with ﬁrm or worker characteristics. Some of these

characteristics such as wage setting institutions are potentially endogenous to the tax

rate. For this reason, we ﬁx the characteristics to the values of 1997, i.e., two years

prior to our ﬁrst panel observation. Heterogeneous ﬁrm eﬀects are estimated at the ﬁrm

level, and worker eﬀects at the individual level. In terms of controls, the models include
municipal, ﬁrm, “state × year” ﬁxed eﬀects (cf. model (3)) and additionally “ﬁrm/worker
type × year” ﬁxed eﬀects. On the worker level, the outcome variable is the log individual
wage, and we additionaly include worker ﬁxed eﬀects.

Inference.

In our baseline approach, we cluster standard errors at the municipal level,

i.e. the level of our identifying variation. Given the well-known problems of biased stan-

dard errors in diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences models (Bertrand, Duﬂo and Mullainathan, 2004),

we conduct two tests to assess the sensitivity of our estimates: First, we aggregate the

data to the municipal level, ﬁnding similar results. Second, we follow the suggestions by

Angrist and Pischke (2009) to “pass the buck up one level” and cluster standard errors

11

on a higher level of aggregation, which in our case is the county or the commuting zone.

As will be shown below, standard errors of estimates are hardly aﬀected.

3.2 Measuring the tax incidence

The DID estimate from equation (3) measures the elasticity of the wage rate with respect
to the net-of-business tax rate, ˆδ = dw
w . We can use this estimate to calculate the
incidence of corporate taxes on wages as the share of the total business tax burden falling

d(1−τ )

(1−τ )

on workers. We do so by relating the welfare change of workers induced by a marginal

change in the net-of-tax rate to the sum of the welfare changes of workers and ﬁrm owners

(see Su´arez Serrato and Zidar, 2016).

Assume that worker i in municipality c maximizes utility U (C, L) over consumption
C and leisure L, subject to the budget constraint C = w(1 − t)L, where t is the personal
income tax rate and L the quantity of labor.18 The indirect utility function can be written
as V ((1 − t)w) and the change in worker utility induced by a change in the wage rate
is given by dV = L(1 − t)dw. A representative ﬁrm j faces a corporate tax rate τ and
maximizes proﬁts, Π = (1− τ )[F (K, L)− wL]− (1− ατ )rK, over capital K and labor L.
The tax base T is given by T = F (K, L) − wL − αrK, where α is the share of deductible
capital costs. By the envelope theorem, the change in welfare for ﬁrm owners is given
by dΠ = −dτ T − dwL(1 − τ ). The share of workers in the overall burden of a marginal
dV +dΠ. Plugging in our estimate of ˆδ
change in the corporate tax rate is given by I w = dV

and rearranging, the share of workers in the tax burden can be written as:

I w =

wLˆδ(1 − t)

(1 − τ )T − wLˆδ(t − τ )

.

(4)

Equation (4) measures the incidence of corporate taxation on wages. As in Su´arez Serrato

and Zidar (2016), the wage elasticity with respect to the net of tax rate is a suﬃcient
statistic to calculate marginal welfare changes of both workers and ﬁrms.19

It would

also be interesting to look at responses in input factors or output. This would allow us to

calculate the excess burden of the corporate income tax. However, given that the necessary

information is either incomplete (output) or not available (capital) in our administrative

wage data (see Section 2.3) and given that linking another dataset to our data is not

possible, addressing these questions is beyond the scope of this paper.

18 We omit indices for readability. For notational simplicity, we assume quasilinear preferences and

normalize the marginal utility of income to unity.

19 This approach relies on simplifying assumptions. In particular, all agents are price takers, that is,
imperfect competition in input and output markets is not taken into account, and the measure abstracts
from heterogeneity of ﬁrms and workers.

4 Baseline results

We start our analysis of the wage eﬀects of the LBT by plotting the event study estimates

from equation (1) in Panel A of Figure 3 for three diﬀerent speciﬁcations: any increase,

large increases, and any decrease. Given the 0-1-event dummy deﬁnition, we exclude

tax decreases (increases) from the sample used to estimate the eﬀect of tax increases
(decreases).20 We ﬁnd a negative and signiﬁcant eﬀect of business tax increases on real

wages. We hardly observe any decline in nominal wages in our data but ﬁnd slower wage

growth in aﬀected ﬁrms over time, leading to lower levels in the future. Reassuringly,

wage eﬀects become stronger when focusing on the 25% largest tax increases. Estimates

for tax decreases (which are relatively rare - cf. Figure 2) are noisy and inconclusive. The

point estimates hint at a slight yet insigniﬁcant pre-trend. In the sensitivity checks below,

we show that municipalities with tax decreases are not driving our results.

In order to exploit the diﬀerent sizes of tax changes, we plot the cumulative eﬀects

of the distributed lag model (equation (2)) in Panel B of Figure 3. The higher the net-of-

tax rate increase, the higher the wage growth. Hence, the results of the event study are

conﬁrmed as a tax increase implies a decrease in the net-of-tax rate. Including four leads

of the change in the log net-of-tax rate, we again ﬁnd a ﬂat pre-trend. The model plotted

in Panel B is estimated on the same sample of municipalities to allow for comparisons to

Panel A. Appendix Figure D.3 shows a similar pattern when including all municipalities.

A remaining concern in our setting is that tax rates might respond to local business

cycle shocks, which could also aﬀect wages. We can test directly for violations of the

identifying assumptions by using local economic outcomes as left-hand-side variables in the

event study design. Figure 4 shows the results for GDP and unemployment. Investigating

the pre-treatment periods, we ﬁnd ﬂat pre-trends for our speciﬁcations using (large) tax
increases.21 We ﬁnd similar patterns when looking at municipal revenues and spending

(see Appendix Figure D.5). For tax decreases, we ﬁnd again pre-trends for GDP but not

unemployment (see Appendix Figure D.4).

20 We also estimated the model on other sample deﬁnitions: (i) no restriction, (ii) zero decreases and
only one increase in event window, (iii) zero decreases and only one increase in the sample. Appendix
Figure D.1 shows that those kinds of sample restrictions are not driving our results.

21 This is in line with previous evidence for the German LBT (Foremny and Riedel, 2014) as well as
for income tax reforms in Europe (Castanheira, Nicod`eme and Profeta, 2012), which suggests that tax
changes are typically triggered by political factors, not shocks on economic variables.

speciﬁcations mainly to establish ﬂat pre-trends, we use the DiD model given by equation

for liable ﬁrms is provided in column (1) of Table 1. A one percent decline in the net-of-

tax rate (reﬂecting an increase in the tax rate) reduces wages by 0.39 percent. Applying

formula (4), we can calculate the share of the tax burden borne by workers as a measure

of tax incidence. We ﬁnd that 51% of the corporate tax burden is passed onto workers.

Source: LIAB and Statistical Oﬃces of the Laender. Notes: This table presents the DiD estimates, ˆδ,
of regression model (3) at the ﬁrm level. Coeﬃcients measure the wage elasticity with respect to the
net-of-local-business-tax rate. The incidence eﬀect I w is measured according to formula (4) as the share
of the total tax burden borne by workers. All regression models include municipal and ﬁrm ﬁxed eﬀects.
Additional control variables and ﬁxed eﬀects (year, “state × year” or “commuting zone (CZ) × year”)
vary depending on the speciﬁcation (as indicated at the bottom of the table). The estimation sample
is restricted to all establishments liable to the LBT in non-merged municipalities. Standard errors are
clustered at the municipal level. Corresponding standard errors for the incidence measure are obtained
using the Delta method. Our preferred (baseline) speciﬁcation is shown in column (1).

Sensitivity checks. We run a set of sensitivity checks testing whether our estimates

are driven by modeling choices. We start with further tests of the robustness of our

estimates with respect to unobserved local shocks. The baseline speciﬁcation includes
“state × year” ﬁxed eﬀects to non-parametrically account for shocks at the state level.
We estimate various speciﬁcations where we vary the set of control variables, replacing
“state × year” with more aggregated year ﬁxed eﬀects or more disaggregated “commuting
zone (CZ) × year” ﬁxed eﬀects. We also estimate speciﬁcations where we add local
controls (GDP, unemployment, spending, population) and ﬁrm controls (employment) to

16

the model, capturing the local business cycle.22 If local shocks were important, estimates

should vary across diﬀerent speciﬁcations. Yet, the results reported in Table 1 are robust.

In particular, estimates are unchanged when moving from the baseline to the very rich

speciﬁcation with CZ-year ﬁxed eﬀects.

While our baseline results are estimated at the ﬁrm level, we also estimated the DiD

model at the municipal and individual level (cf. Appendix Table D.1). While estimates

are a bit noisier on the municipal level due to smaller numbers of observations, point

estimates are reassuringly similar at all three levels of aggregation.

In our baseline speciﬁcation, the dependent variable is the median wage in the ﬁrm.

We chose this measure to account for the right-censoring of the data, which would bias our
estimates toward zero.23 Nevertheless, we conduct several additional checks to assess the

implications of this choice. First, we check that results are not driven by the composition

of the workforce and hence by a change in the median worker. Speciﬁcation (6) in Table

1 shows that estimates are hardly aﬀected when controlling for various worker shares

(age, gender, skill, occupation and employment type) at the ﬁrm level. This is conﬁrmed

by a second test where we estimate the DiD model using the diﬀerent worker shares as

dependent variables. Results are shown in Appendix Table D.2 and reveal that the worker

composition does not react to changes in the tax rate. Estimates are insigniﬁcant and/or

very small. Third, and in line with the predicted bias toward zero, speciﬁcation (3) of

Table D.3 shows that the wage eﬀect increases when controlling for the share of never-

censored workers at the ﬁrm level. Similarly, we ﬁnd that wage eﬀects are stronger for

ﬁrms with fewer censored workers. Last, we estimate the DiD model at the worker level

and exclude all individuals who at least once earned a wage above the contribution ceiling

during the observation period. Again, we ﬁnd that estimates increase when excluding
censored workers (see column (7) of Table D.6 as well as Table D.8).24

We also test the sensitivity with respect to sample restrictions (cf. Appendix Table

D.5). Our DiD baseline sample comprises ﬁrms liable to the LBT in municipalities that

22All control variables are in logs and lagged by two periods to reduce endogeneity issues; results are

similar when using contemporaneous variables.

23 If all workers earned above the contribution ceiling, we would not be able to observe any wage change
in the data and hence estimate a zero wage eﬀect. However, in our data, the median worker in almost
all ﬁrms earns a wage below the cap for social security contributions (see Table C.4). We also estimated
model (3) using diﬀerent wage measures as left-hand side variables (cf. Appendix Table D.4). When using
the mean wage on the ﬁrm level (instead of the median), we ﬁnd smaller yet still signiﬁcant wage eﬀects.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that wages for the top 25% of workers across ﬁrms respond less. We discuss potential
distributional implications in more detail below.

24 Imputing censored wages would be another option used in the literature (Dustmann, Ludsteck and
Schoenberg, 2009; Card, Heining and Kline, 2013). While this is sensible when analyzing wage inequality,
it is problematic in our setting since the LBT rate would have to be included in both the selection
equation and the second stage equation.

17

never merged with other municipalities and never experienced a tax decrease during the

observation period. We ﬁnd smaller but still signiﬁcant eﬀects when adding tax-exempt

ﬁrms to the baseline sample (see also the discussion in Section 5.2). Likewise, estimates

decrease when adding the merged municipalities to the sample. In column (4) of Table

D.5, we restrict the sample to municipalities without a tax decrease during the observation

period to rule out that those decreases are driving the results. DiD estimates increase

slightly, which suggests that potential endogeneity would bias our estimates downward.

In columns (5) and (6), we add ﬁrms that switched their incorporation status and ﬁrms

with less than four workers to the estimation sample (cf. Section 2.4). In both cases, the

wage elasticity increases a bit. In 2008, the basic federal rate of the LBT was reduced

from 5 to 3.5% and deductibility of the tax payment itself was abolished (see Section 2.1).

Results are robust to dropping this year from the sample (column 7).

Finally, we show that standard errors hardly change when clustering at higher ag-

gregation levels than municipalities such as counties or commuting zones (see Appendix

Table D.7). These ﬁndings are in line with the results that we get when estimating the

model on diﬀerent levels of aggregation (Table D.1).

5 Theoretical mechanisms and heterogeneous eﬀects

We have established that workers on average bear half of the corporate tax burden. In

this section, we analyze the economic forces driving this eﬀect. We start with a brief

discussion of diﬀerent theoretical models of corporate tax incidence and the wage eﬀects

they predict (see Appendix A for the full theoretical analysis). In a second step, we exploit

the rich ﬁrm and worker level information in our data to investigate the predictions of

the diﬀerent theories.

5.1 Theoretical predictions

In his seminal paper on corporate tax incidence, Harberger (1962) considers a closed

economy with a corporate and a non-corporate sector.

In his setting, the burden of

corporate taxes is borne entirely by capital. The subsequent literature has emphasized

the importance of international capital mobility.
taxes reduce domestic investment, and wages decline.25

In open economies, higher corporate

In this paper, we study the eﬀects of a local business tax. In this setting labor is

25 See, e.g., Bradford (1978); Kotlikoﬀ and Summers (1987). In these models, the share of the (source-
based) corporate tax burden borne by domestic immobile factors increases as the size of the economy
relative to the rest of the world decreases. See Auerbach (2006), Harberger (2006) and Gravelle (2013)
for surveys of the literature.

18

arguably more mobile across jurisdictional borders than internationally. In the polar case

of perfect worker mobility, local corporate tax changes should not aﬀect wages because
they are determined in the national labor market.26 Yet, even at the local level, mobility

is likely to be imperfect, and it may diﬀer across workers.

Even with perfect worker mobility, Tiebout (1956)-type models would predict neg-

ative wage responses to local corporate tax increases because migration decisions may

depend on local public services. If the additional revenue raised is spent on local public

services, workers may accept lower local wages. An implication of the Tiebout model is

that wages would also decline in tax-exempt ﬁrms if the local tax rate increases.

The models discussed so far are based on the assumption of competitive product and

labor markets. If products (or consumers) are costlessly mobile across jurisdictions, ﬁrms

cannot shift the burden onto their customers. This implies that other shifting channels

must be more relevant. Given that we look at a local tax, we expect the pass-through

on consumer prices to be of second order. Nevertheless, the incidence on wages might be

higher for industries that produce more tradable goods.

Relaxing the assumption of perfectly competitive labor markets, we show in Ap-

pendix A that most models with labor market frictions also predict that higher corporate

taxes reduce wages. The mechanisms at work are, however, diﬀerent, and the magnitude

of the eﬀects depends on wage setting institutions. We will brieﬂy discuss the key insights

from these models in the following paragraphs.

In collective bargaining models, workers receive a share of the surplus generated by
the ﬁrm. If higher corporate taxes reduce this surplus, workers bear part of the burden.27

The level at which employers and unions bargain over wages is important. Local taxes

can be expected to have the strongest impact on wages if bargaining is at the ﬁrm level,

and the ﬁrm operates in one jurisdiction only. If wages are set at the sector level, the

impact of a tax change in one jurisdiction will decrease with the number of jurisdictions

where the sector is present. Similarly, if a ﬁrm operates plants in multiple jurisdictions,

a tax change in one may not matter much – even if wages are set at the ﬁrm level.

Fair wage models (Akerlof and Yellen, 1990; Amiti and Davis, 2010) also imply

that higher corporate taxes reduce wages. In some variants, wages are directly related to

after tax proﬁts. In other eﬃciency wage models, such as shirking models (Solow, 1979;

Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984), the optimal wage trades oﬀ higher output against the cost of

26 Along the same lines, a standard assumption is that output prices are determined in national markets

for goods and services so that the tax burden cannot be shifted onto consumers.

27 The rent accruing to the workers declines, but how this is translated into changes in employment and
wages is theoretically ambiguous. If employment is constant or increases, wages decline unambiguously.
However, it is theoretically possible that employment declines by so much that wages increase although
the overall rent accruing to workers falls.

19

higher wages.28 If wage setting in tax-exempt ﬁrms considers wages in taxable ﬁrms as

a reference for fairness, the prediction would be that wages in tax-exempt ﬁrms are also

aﬀected by tax changes.

In monopsonistic labor markets where ﬁrms have wage setting power, higher cor-

porate taxes also reduce wages. The magnitude of the eﬀect depends on the degree of

market power. Firms with a lot of market power will pay lower wages. This implies little

room for wages to fall in response to higher corporate taxes and consequently smaller

wage eﬀects in ﬁrms dominating the local labor market.

Another factor that may aﬀect the incidence of corporate taxes is income shifting to

avoid taxes. Large, multi-plant and in particular foreign-owned ﬁrms can avoid taxes by

shifting proﬁts across jurisdictions or even abroad. If this is relevant, we should observe

smaller eﬀects of tax changes for these ﬁrms.

28 Here, higher corporate taxes decrease investment and therefore reduce the marginal productivity
gain from a wage increase. Consequently, wages fall when corporate taxes increase. A similar mechanism
is at play in directed search models, where higher wages aﬀected productivity through better worker-ﬁrm
matches (Acemoglu and Shimer, 1999).

20

In Table 2, we summarize the diﬀerent theoretical mechanisms and the predicted

wage eﬀects. We can shed light on the relevance of these theories by testing their main

assumptions and mechanisms using the rich linked employer-employee data. The last

column of Table 2 provides a preview of our empirical ﬁndings.

5.2 Empirical tests

In this subsection, we investigate the empirical relevance of the diﬀerent theories discussed

in the preceding section. As diﬀerent mechanisms may be at play simultaneously, it is
diﬃcult (if not impossible) to single out speciﬁc channels empirically.29 Nonetheless, the

rich linked employer-employee data allows us to zoom in on central implications of the

diﬀerent theories and test their relevance, assuming that other characteristics are given.

We test the diﬀerent theoretical predictions by interacting the net-of-tax rate from the

DiD model (3) with pre-determined indicators for speciﬁc ﬁrm or worker types.

Firm-level heterogeneity. The ﬁrm-level results are presented in Table 3. We start by
testing whether tax-exempt ﬁrms also respond to tax rate changes.30 We ﬁnd a negative
but insigniﬁcant point estimate for tax-exempt ﬁrms.31 This result suggests that Tiebout

sorting mechanisms do not play a major role in the German context. In line with this

assertion, we ﬁnd that estimates do not change when we include current and future

municipal spending as additional control variables (see column (3) of Table D.3). Instead,

the negative point estimate suggests that the higher tax burden on other ﬁrms might give

tax-exempt ﬁrms a competitive advantage, boosting their wages.

Next, we test for diﬀerences by industry. Empirically, we ﬁnd larger and signiﬁcant

eﬀects only for manufacturing and construction sector ﬁrms. One explanation for the

diﬀerence to trade and service sector ﬁrms could be that the latter are able to shift part

of the burden to their customers as their products and services are on average less tradable

than manufacturing goods.

Next, we investigate the interaction of tax rates and diﬀerent wage-setting institu-

29 For instance, a large multi-plant ﬁrm might be more proﬁtable than others. Consequently, it may
be able to shift income abroad. At the same time, wages may be set via collective bargaining at the ﬁrm
level. In order to isolate and test a speciﬁc theory, e.g., union bargaining, we would need exogenous (and
exclusive) variation in the bargaining status of the ﬁrm.

30 In the absence of any spill-overs, we could estimate a triple-diﬀerence model. The resulting treatment
eﬀect, which would equal the diﬀerence between the two DiD estimates for liable and non-liable ﬁrms,
would be larger.

31 When considering all ﬁrms, column (2) of Table D.3 shows that the average worker in Germany
bears 22% of the LBT instead of 51% in liable ﬁrms. This is conﬁrmed when estimating the event study
design for liable vs. non-liable ﬁrms (see Appendix Figure D.2).

(CBA) of the ﬁrm. We group ﬁrms into three categories: ﬁrms with (i) a sector-level

CBA; (ii) a ﬁrm-level CBA; (iii) no CBA. Overall, we ﬁnd larger wage eﬀects for ﬁrms

under collective bargaining. In line with the theoretical predictions, we ﬁnd that the inci-

dence eﬀects for ﬁrm-level bargaining are stronger than for sector-level CBA. We also ﬁnd

wage responses for ﬁrms without CBA but they are smaller and not signiﬁcant. Another

striking empirical pattern is that eﬀects are increasing in ﬁrm proﬁtability. This is in line

with collective bargaining models, but also many other labor market theories, where rents

are split between ﬁrms and workers, for instance fair wage models.

When stratifying the results by ﬁrm size, we ﬁnd that the wage eﬀect is driven by

small and medium sized ﬁrms, which account for more than 95% of all ﬁrms in Germany

(and employ about two-thirds of the workers). Taking a closer look, we also ﬁnd signiﬁcant

wage eﬀects for larger and proﬁtable manufacturing ﬁrms with up to 500 employees. These

ﬁrms (the so-called “Mittelstand”) are often considered to be the backbone of the German

economy, with many ’hidden champions’ (Simon, 2009). Our results suggest that workers

in these companies are more aﬀected by local corporate tax changes than employees of

very large ﬁrms. One reason for this ﬁnding may be local wage setting power of larger

ﬁrms, as suggested by monoposony models. When interacting the LBT rate with a dummy

indicating the size of the ﬁrm relative to the local labor market, we indeed ﬁnd that wages

in relatively small ﬁrms react more strongly.

Other potential explanations for the insigniﬁcant wage eﬀect in large ﬁrms include

more tax avoidance opportunities or a presence in multiple jurisdictions. Table 3 shows

signiﬁcant wage eﬀects only for single-plant ﬁrms, while establishments in multi-plant

ﬁrms show no wage response. For those ﬁrms, tax changes in one jurisdiction might not

be relevant enough to inﬂuence wages. Another explanation is that multi-plant ﬁrms can

shift proﬁts to other jurisdictions (nationally and/or internationally). In line with this

reasoning, we also ﬁnd a zero (to be precise, a negative but insigniﬁcant) wage eﬀect if a
plant has a foreign owner.33 This supports the theoretical prediction that proﬁt-shifting

opportunities dampen eﬀects of local tax changes on wages.

32 See Appendix B.2 for a brief discussion of labor market institutions in Germany.
33 Neither the eﬀect for single-plant ﬁrms nor for German-owned ﬁrms is driven by ﬁrm size.

Worker heterogeneity. We test for worker heterogeneity by estimating model (3)

at the individual level. Baseline estimates are similar to results at the ﬁrm level and
robust to including various control sets (cf. Table D.6).34 Heterogeneous worker eﬀects

are summarized in Table 4.

In our ﬁrst test, we look at the eﬀect by skill. While eﬀects are similar for medium-

and low-skilled workers, we ﬁnd no wage eﬀect for high-skilled individuals, even if we

exclude workers aﬀected by censoring (see Appendix Table D.8). A potential reason

for this diﬀerence is that high-skilled workers are usually more mobile than low-skilled

individuals in Germany (Haas, 2000). An alternative explanation would be that the wage
setting process diﬀers across skill levels.35

Mobility eﬀects are also a potential explanation for our heterogeneous eﬀects by

gender, where we ﬁnd larger wage eﬀects for women. In Germany, women are often the

secondary earner in a couple. This reduces their mobility. We check that gender eﬀects are

not driven by diﬀerences in industry, occupation, or diﬀerent work contracts in terms of

working hours. In general, wage eﬀects do not change when including part-time workers;

see column (8) of Table D.6. When diﬀerentiating by broad occupation group, we ﬁnd a

stronger eﬀect for blue-collar workers, in line with the results by industry shown above.

Similarly, when stratifying by age, the eﬀect is signiﬁcantly higher for younger workers.

Our results for heterogeneous types of workers are particularly important for the

distributional implications of corporate taxation. We conﬁrm other empirical studies

that corporate taxes are not entirely borne by capital, ﬁnding that half of the burden

is shifted onto wage earners.

In addition, more vulnerable worker groups are aﬀected

more strongly by changes in corporate tax rates. Both ﬁndings reduce the progressivity

of business taxes and consequently of the overall tax system.

We assess the implications of our ﬁndings for tax progressivity in a back-of-the-

envelope calculation. Our starting point is the study on the progressivity of the US

tax system by Piketty and Saez (2007). They calculate eﬀective average (personal plus

corporate) income tax rates across the income distribution, and measure the progressivity

of the tax system by comparing the average tax rate of the top 10% or top 1% to the

average tax rate of the bottom 90%. Importantly, they assume that corporate taxes fall

34 Unlike the analysis at the ﬁrm-level, for which we used the median wage as our left-hand-side
variable, the observed wage at the individual level might be censored as discussed above. We address
this issue by estimating each interaction model for the full sample of all workers and for a subsample
excluding individuals who have been above the contribution ceiling at least once. As above, we ﬁnd that
wage eﬀects increase when restricting the sample to never censored workers (see Appendix Table D.8).

35 More bargaining power of skilled workers is not a suﬃcient explanation for the observation that
wages of this group do not fall in response to higher taxes. Groups with high bargaining power can be
expected to capture a high share of the ﬁrm’s proﬁt ex ante, so that they should suﬀer larger losses than
groups with less bargaining power if corporate taxes increase.

entirely on capital income. We take their data and estimates as a benchmark for the US

and use comparable data compiled by Bach, Beznoska and Steiner (2016) for Germany.

We then compute two counterfactuals where 50% (or 100%) of corporate taxes fall on
wages. Calculations are reported in Appendix Table D.9.36 The ratio between the total

eﬀective average tax rate of the top 1% and the bottom 90% decreases substantially from

2.9 to 2.2 if half of the corporate tax burden is borne by labor, or to 1.9 if the full corporate

tax burden is shifted onto wages. We ﬁnd similar relative changes of progressivity for the

German tax system (decreasing from 6.1 to 4.6 and 3.7). Overall, our calculations imply

that the progressivity of the overall tax system in both countries would decline by between

25 and 40% if we account for our incidence estimates.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we exploit the compelling institutional setting of the German local business

tax to analyze the incidence of corporate taxes on wages. We combine administrative

information from 1993 to 2012 on the universe of municipalities with administrative linked

employer-employee data to estimate the causal eﬀect of corporate taxation on wages.

36 Further details are explained in the notes to Appendix Table D.9.

25

Averaging over ﬁrms liable to the LBT, workers bear about 51% of the total tax burden.

This ﬁnding is similar to other studies analyzing the corporate tax incidence on wages

(Arulampalam, Devereux and Maﬃni, 2012; Liu and Altshuler, 2013; Su´arez Serrato and

Zidar, 2016).

Our results thus conﬁrm the view that labor bears a substantial share of the cor-

porate tax burden. Importantly, our results are obtained by exploiting variation at the

local level. Corporate taxes levied at the subnational level exist in many countries, and

our results are likely to be relevant in these countries as well. At the same time, it is

important to discuss how our ﬁndings are related to settings with state-level or national

corporate taxes. Two diﬀerences are important. On the one hand, labor is likely to be

more mobile at the local level, which attenuates the incidence on wages. On the other

hand, focusing on tax changes at the municipal level implies that changes of prices other

than wages, in particular output prices and prices of intermediate goods, are probably

much smaller than in the case of national corporate tax changes. This would imply that

wage eﬀects of local tax changes are larger.

Going beyond the average wage eﬀect, our analysis shows that incidence estimates

diﬀer considerably across ﬁrms and individuals. First, we do not ﬁnd eﬀects for ﬁrms that

are not liable to the LBT. Second, our ﬁndings suggest that labor market institutions play

a key role for the incidence of corporate taxes on wages. If there is rent sharing in the

labor market, due to collective bargaining, for instance, wage responses are larger. Third,

wage eﬀects are close to zero for ﬁrms that operate in multiple jurisdictions, large ﬁrms

and foreign-owned ﬁrms. This may be explained by proﬁt-shifting opportunities available

to these ﬁrms. Clearly, the heterogeneous results are correlations and should be seen as a

ﬁrst step toward understanding the underlying mechanisms of the incidence of corporate

taxation on wages. For a more rigorous test of competing theories, additional exogenous

variation in labor market institutions and other ﬁrm characteristics would be necessary.

The heterogeneous worker analysis reveals stronger wage eﬀects for low-skilled work-

ers, women and young workers. High-skilled employees are not aﬀected at all. This chal-

lenges the widespread view that the corporate income tax is highly progressive. In fact,

our estimates imply that the shifting of part of the corporate tax burden onto wages

reduces the overall progressivity of the tax systems both in Germany and the U.S. by 25

to 40% compared to a hypothetical situation where no shifting occurs.

An important limitation of our analysis is that we focus on wage eﬀects and do not

investigate the impact of tax changes on quantities of input factors, on output or on entry

and exit of ﬁrms. These potential responses are important for the eﬃciency costs of taxes.

Another limitation is that we do not consider the impact on land rents. These are issues

for future research.

A The theory of corporate tax incidence

The theoretical literature has produced various models of corporate tax incidence. These

models lead to diﬀerent predictions, depending on the assumptions made about factor

and output markets, wage-setting institutions, the structure of the tax system and be-

havioral reactions to tax changes. In the seminal paper by Harberger (1962), the economy

is closed, labor markets are competitive and capital is in ﬁxed supply. At least for plau-
sible parameter values, the corporate tax burden is almost fully borne by capital.37 The

subsequent literature has emphasized the importance of international capital mobility in

open economies (Diamond and Mirrlees, 1971a,b; Bradford, 1978; Kotlikoﬀ and Summers,
1987; Harberger, 1995).38 In these models, the share of the (source-based) corporate tax

burden bore by domestic immobile factors increases as the size of the economy relative to

the rest of the world decreases. In the case of a small open economy that faces a perfectly

elastic supply of capital, the burden of the corporate tax is fully borne by factors other

than capital. If proﬁts of a ﬁrm are the result of location speciﬁc rents, the tax will partly

fall on these rents. By contrast, if rents are ﬁrm speciﬁc and ﬁrms are mobile, the tax
burden will be fully shifted to owners of immobile factors like land or labor.39

However, complete immobility of labor is a strong assumption, in particular when

considering corporate taxes at the sub-national level. Another restrictive assumption

of standard models is that labor markets are competitive. Relatively little attention

has been paid to the role of wage-setting institutions and labor market frictions in the

context of corporate taxation, two exceptions the studies by Felix and Hines (2009) and

Arulampalam, Devereux and Maﬃni (2012).

In this Appendix, we discuss the implications of various wage-setting models for the

impact of corporate tax changes on wages. As will be explained further below, the model

will be varied slightly to incorporate diﬀerent assumptions about wage setting and two

aspects of the tax system relating to formula apportionment and income shifting.

Consider an economy which consists of n jurisdictions. There is a large number of

37 Feldstein (1974) and Ballentine (1978) study tax incidence in models with endogenous savings and

ﬁnd that part of the tax burden is shifted to labor.

38 Other important extensions of the canonical Harberger model focus on the sectoral composition
(Shoven, 1976), savings behavior (Feldstein, 1974; Bradford, 1978) and the presence of uncertainty in the
economy (Ratti and Shome, 1977).

39 From a global perspective, a tax increase in one jurisdiction reduces the income of immobile factors
in that jurisdiction but increases the income of immobile factors and reduces capital income in the rest
of the world.
In principle, the burden of corporate taxes may also fall on suppliers or on customers,
provided input and output prices are not pinned down by international markets.

ﬁrms in the economy. To ease notation we normalize the number of ﬁrms per jurisdiction

to unity. Firms use the following factors of production: capital (K) and labor of two
skill levels. Labor of skill type k, k = h, l, is denoted by Lk.40 We will consider diﬀerent

production technologies. In the base version of the model we consider a concave produc-
tion function F (K, Lh, Ll), which is assumed to exhibit declining returns to scale. One

interpretation is that there is an implicit fourth factor, which may be interpreted as a

location-speciﬁc rent. While capital and both types of labor are mobile across municipal

borders, ﬁrms are immobile, due to the location-speciﬁc rent.

The after-tax proﬁt of ﬁrm i located in jurisdiction j , j = 1...n, is given by

where pi is the output price, ri is the non-tax cost of capital and wk

of skill type k. In some variants of the model, labor markets may not clear. In these

is the wage labor

cases, we assume that unemployed workers of skill type k receive unemployment beneﬁts
denoted by wk. The tax rate on corporate proﬁts in jurisdiction j is denoted by τj.

The variable α, with 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, is a tax base parameter representing the share
of the capital cost which can be deducted from the tax base. This parameter is the

same in all jurisdictions. A cash-ﬂow tax would imply α = 1, that is full deductibility

of all costs. Most existing corporate tax systems are more restrictive, however. Costs

of debt ﬁnancing are usually deductible while costs of equity ﬁnancing are not and loss

oﬀset is typically restricted. These properties of the corporate tax base are important for

theoretical predictions about the incidence of the tax, as will be shown below.

In the following we drop the index j for ﬁrm variables to ease notation. Total

diﬀerentiation of the proﬁt equation and using the standard ﬁrst order conditions for

proﬁt-maximization yields

a combination of these eﬀects. It is also possible that some of these groups lose while

others gain.

The distribution of the tax burden depends on how the model is closed, that is,

40 To keep the notation simple we abstract from other input factors like land, energy or other interme-
diate goods. Clearly, the prices of these goods could also be aﬀected by corporate tax changes and the
suppliers might bear part of the corporate tax burden. Corporate tax changes could also be capitalized
in house prices.

on the assumed overall structure of the economy, in particular the supply and demand

elasticities in factor markets and the wage-setting institutions. In the following, we discuss

the corporate tax incidence on wages under diﬀerent assumptions about the labor market

regime. As a benchmark, we start with the case of competitive labor markets. We then

turn to models with wage bargaining, fair wage models, models where wages aﬀect worker

productivity and monopsonistic labor markets. In all of the following cases, we assume

that output markets are perfectly competitive and normalize the price p of the output

good to equal 1.

A.1 Competitive labor markets

Assume that input markets are perfectly competitive, so that factor prices will adjust to

equate demand and supply. Factor demand functions are given by the ﬁrm’s ﬁrst order

Equation (9) shows that, in general, the impact of a tax change on the wage depends

on demand and supply elasticities in the labor market. However, if the corporate tax is

a cash-ﬂow tax (α = 1), a change in the corporate tax rate will be neutral for factor

demand and, hence, will leave wages unchanged. As a result, the corporate tax is a lump

sum tax and the tax burden falls entirely on proﬁts:

This may be stated as

Result 1: Competitive labor markets: The impact of a tax change on wages depends

on the demand and supply elasticities in the labor market.

If all costs are perfectly

deductible, the burden of the corporate income tax is fully borne by ﬁrm owners. Then a

tax rate change does not aﬀect the wage rate.

Interestingly, the cash-ﬂow tax result also carries over to various (but not all) stan-

dard models of imperfect labor markets, as we will show below. Most real world corporate

tax systems deviate from the polar case of a proﬁt tax with perfect cost deductibility,

though. Accordingly, models of tax incidence in the literature typically consider settings

where either capital or labor costs are less than fully deductible.

A.2 Wage bargaining

Various labor market theories assume that wages are set via bargaining between ﬁrms

and their employees. Bargaining models imply that ﬁrm owners and employees share a

surplus generated by the ﬁrm. If corporate taxes reduce this surplus, it is straightforward

to expect that employees share part of the loss through lower wages. The magnitude

of these wage eﬀects depends on the level where bargaining takes place. We consider

individual and collective (ﬁrm and sector-level) bargaining.

36

A.2.1 Individual wage bargaining

Assume that the wage is set via bargaining between the ﬁrm and the employee. The

most widely used labor market model where this happens is the job search model, where

ﬁrms and individual employees bargain over a matching rent (see Rogerson, Shimer and

Wright, 2005, for a survey).

Let the output a worker of type k in ﬁrm i be given by Qk

i ). The additional

A higher corporate tax reduces the wage unless capital costs are fully deductible. Since

the employee’s share of the surplus generated by the ﬁrm is increasing in the employee’s

bargaining power, it is plausible that she also bears a larger loss if her bargaining power

is higher. This may be stated as

Result 2: Individual wage bargaining: If capital costs are less than fully deductible,

an increase in the local corporate tax rate reduces the wage.

This wage change increases with the bargaining power of the employee.

If the

employee receives a large part of the surplus generated by the ﬁrm, she also bears a large

loss if the surplus declines due to taxation.

37

A.2.2 Collective bargaining

Assume that trade union represent workers. We consider two cases: The ﬁrst case is ﬁrm-

level bargaining, where ﬁrm-level unions bargain with individual ﬁrms. The second case

is sector-level bargaining, where sector-level unions bargain with sector-level employer

organizations.

Firm-level bargaining. Denote the wage for a worker of skill type k employed by a
ﬁrm located in jurisdiction i by wk
i is the wage premium generated by
bargaining at the ﬁrm-level. The bargaining model we use for the ﬁrm-level is a standard

i , where sk

i = wk

i +sk

eﬃcient bargaining model (McDonald and Solow, 1981), where unions and ﬁrms bargain
over the wage premium, sk
i . Each skill type is represented by one
trade union and each ﬁrm negotiates with the two unions simultaneously (Barth and

i , and employment Lk

Zweim¨uller, 1995). The objective function of the trade union representing the workers of

skill type k in ﬁrm i is given by

Z k

i = Lk

i (wk

i − wk) = Lk
i sk
i .

In case of disagreement, the rent of the union Z k

i and the ﬁrm’s proﬁt P F B

i

are equal

to zero. After wages and employment levels are determined, ﬁrms set Ki to maximize
proﬁts:

The wage premium sk∗
ﬁrm. The size of this share is increasing in the relative bargaining power of the skill group

is equal to a share of the surplus per employee generated by the

i

and decreasing in the bargaining power of the other group of employees. Employment

is set so that the marginal productivity of labor is equal to the skill-speciﬁc reservation

wage. Diﬀerentiating (13) yields

The left-hand side of (15) is equal to the change in the rent accruing to the workers

of skill type k employed by ﬁrm i. This rent unambiguously declines because of the

tax change. Whether the wage rate declines depends on how employment changes in

response to the tax change. Equations (12) and (14) implicitly deﬁne the factor demand
functions Ki(wk, wj, τi, ..), Lk
i (wk, wj, τi, ..). Standard comparative static analysis shows
that the impact of a tax change on demand for labor of type k may be positive or negative,

depending on whether the diﬀerent production factors are complements or substitutes.

The eﬀect on wages is therefore also ambiguous.

This may be summarized as:

Result 3: Firm-level bargaining: If capital costs are less than fully deductible, an

increase in the local corporate tax rate reduces the rent of each skill group. The eﬀect on

the wage rate is ambiguous and depends on potential changes in employment.

This result is similar to that of individual bargaining. Higher taxes reduce the rent

that can be shared between the ﬁrm and its employees. For given levels of employment,

wages unambiguously decline in response to a tax increase. In the literature, this eﬀect

39

has been referred to as the “direct eﬀect” of a corporate tax change on wages in ﬁrms

where wages are set via collective bargaining (Arulampalam, Devereux and Maﬃni, 2012;

Fuest, Peichl and Siegloch, 2013). Taking into account changes in employment may change

the wage eﬀect (“indirect eﬀect”). If the number of employees declines in response to a

tax increase, the rent generated by the company is shared among a smaller number of

employees and the overall wage eﬀect can be positive or negative.

Sector-level bargaining. We now assume that bargaining takes place at the sector-

level. To ease notation we normalize the number of sectors in the unionized part of the

labor market to unity. This implies that there are n ﬁrms in the sector. An employer

organization bargains with sector-level unions over the sector wide wage. We continue

to assume that each skill group is represented by its own trade union. The employer

organization has the objective of maximizing aggregate proﬁts of the ﬁrms in the sector.

Following the seniority model proposed by Oswald (1993), we assume that each union

wishes to maximize the premium over the reservation wage for the skill group it represents,
which is given by vk = wk−wk. For given wages, ﬁrms set proﬁt-maximizing employment.

In general, the impact of a tax change on the wage is ambiguous.

The wage eﬀect converges to zero if the ﬁrm in the jurisdiction where the tax change

occurs is small, relative to the sector as a whole. The conditions for the wage eﬀect to

The eﬀect is thus negligible if employment (including the tax induced change in em-

ployment) as well as the tax base in jurisdiction m are small, relative to the number of
employees in the sector as a whole, weighted with the tax factors (1 − τi).

This may be summarized as

Result 4: Sector-level bargaining: If capital costs are less than fully deductible, an

increase in the tax rate may increase or decrease wages. The wage eﬀect converges to

zero if the activity of the sector in the jurisdiction where the tax change occurs is small,

41

relative to the rest of the sector.

Result 4 suggests that local tax changes will have a smaller or negligible eﬀect on

wages if wage bargaining takes place at the sector level, rather than the ﬁrm level, because
the sector will usually include many jurisdictions.42

A.3 Fair wage models

In fair wage models (Akerlof, 1982) the wage is usually assumed to be a function of i)
wages of other employees of the same ﬁrm, ii) an external reference wage43 and iii) proﬁts

of the ﬁrm (Amiti and Davis, 2010; Egger and Kreickemeier, 2012).

Consider a ﬁrm i with two types of workers. Assume that the fair wage for type
, Pi), where wk
i
are wages of the other skill group in the ﬁrm and proﬁts

k workers employed by ﬁrm i is given by the function wkf

(20)

(21)

(22)

The fair wage is increasing in unemployment beneﬁts wk

i , in the wage of the other
skill group employed by the ﬁrm and in the ﬁrm’s proﬁts. Equation (21) implies that
the fair wage for skill group k increases if the wage of the other skill group −k increases.
This does not follow directly from the ﬁrst derivatives, as an increase in the wage of the

other skill group reduces proﬁts. The eﬀect on proﬁts reduces the fair wage. Equation

(22) implies that an increase in any of the reservation wages raises the fair wages of both

groups.

42 Some labor markets are characterized by two tier bargaining, where sector-level bargaining sets a
minimum wage and wage premiums on top of the minimum wage are negotiated at the ﬁrm-level (Boeri,
2014). In such a setting, one would expect local tax changes to have a more signiﬁcant impact on local
wages than in the case of pure sector-level wage bargaining.

43 We assume that the reference wage, which can be the average wage level paid in other ﬁrms, a
statutory minimum wage or a transfer to the unemployed, is given. It may of course be the case that the
reference wage is aﬀected by local tax changes. This would not alter the result that higher taxes lead to
lower wages and vice versa.

42

In equilibrium, the ﬁrm pays fair wages to both types of employees and sets factor

inputs to maximize after-tax proﬁts. Optimal factor inputs are given by the standard

marginal productivity conditions. Equilibrium wages are given by

This may be summarized as

Result 5: Fair wage model : An increase in the local corporate tax rate reduces the

wages of all skill groups.

The intuition behind Result 5 is that if higher corporate taxes reduce after-tax

proﬁts, fairness considerations would suggest that employees will bear part of this burden

and vice versa. This eﬀect is independent of whether or not wage and capital costs are

fully deductible from the tax base. The neutrality property of cash-ﬂow taxes does not

hold here because wage fairness is assumed to depend directly on after-tax proﬁts.

A.4 Models where wages aﬀect labor productivity

Some labor market models emphasize that ﬁrms may want to raise wages because higher

wages lead to higher labor productivity and, hence, higher output. These models include

eﬃciency wage models, where higher wages lead to more eﬀort or lower worker ﬂuctuation,

and models of directed job search, where higher wages lead to better matches between

43

workers and ﬁrms.44

Following Acemoglu and Shimer (1999), we assume that output is uncertain and
depends on the quality of ﬁrm worker matches.45 There is only one type of labor. If a

ﬁrm oﬀers a higher wage, more workers will apply for the job and the chances of a good

match increase, given the wages oﬀered by other ﬁrms. With probability ρi(wi, q) the
additional output produced by ﬁlling a vacancy i in a ﬁrm located in jurisdiction j equals
Qi(Ki) , with probability 1− ρi(wi, q) it is equal to zero. The wages paid by other ﬁrms
as well as other factors which may be relevant for the likelihood of success are summarized
by the vector q. The function ρi(wi, q) has the following properties:46

∂ρi
∂wi

> 0,

∂2
i ρ

Expected proﬁts are now given by

44 The key diﬀerence to the fair wage model discussed in the preceding section is that the latter
emphasizes the direct link between the proﬁts of a ﬁrm and the wage that is perceived to be fair. No
such direct link exists here. However, fair wage models may also be considered as models where wages
aﬀect labor productivity because wages deemed as unfair would reduce worker eﬀort or increase costly
ﬂuctuation.

45 The results would be similar in an eﬃciency wage model following Solow (1979) with continuous
eﬀort. In shirking models with discrete eﬀort (such as Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984), we would not expect a
direct eﬀect on wages (for given employment) but only an indirect eﬀect through changes in unemployment
rates and hence the shirking constraint.

46 The assumption that all cross derivatives are equal to zero is made to simplify the exposition, it is

not necessary for the results.

Note that ∆ > 0 follows from the second order conditions for proﬁt maximization. A

higher corporate tax rate thus reduces the wage if there is limited deductibility of capital

costs. This may be summarized as

Result 6: Models where wages aﬀect productivity: If capital costs are less than fully

deductible, an increase in the local corporate tax rate reduces wages.

The optimal wage trades oﬀ higher output against the cost of higher wages. The

increase in output achieved through a wage increase is higher, the higher the capital stock

of the ﬁrm. In the presence of imperfect deductibility of capital costs, investment declines

when the tax rate increases. Therefore the ﬁrm’s marginal productivity gain from a wage

increase falls. As a result, it is optimal for the ﬁrm to adjust its wage policy towards

lower wages and a lower quality of worker ﬁrm matches.

A.5 Monopsonistic labor market

Consider a ﬁrm facing the labor supply function by Ls = Ls(w), Ls(cid:48)(w) > 0. Output is
produced using a standard, strictly concave production technology F (Ki, Li) with com-
plementarity between labor and capital: ∂2F (Ki,Ls(wi))

> 0 . Proﬁts are given by
i (Ki, wi) = F (Ki, Ls(wi))(1 − τj) − wiLs(wi)(1 − τj) − (1 − ατi)rKi

This implies

Result 7: Monopsonistic labor market: If capital costs are less than fully deductible, an

increase in the local corporate tax rate reduces wages.

A higher corporate tax rate reduces investment so that the marginal productivity

of labor falls. As a result, ﬁrms employ less labor. In a monopsonistic labor market this
implies a lower wage.47

A.6 Extensions

In this subsection, we consider two extensions of the model that are both related to

particular aspects of corporate taxation. The ﬁrst extension takes into account that ﬁrms

may operate in more than one jurisdiction. Many countries use formula apportionment

to allocate corporate proﬁts to diﬀerent jurisdictions for taxation purposes. The second

extension is to allow for tax avoidance through diﬀerent types of income shifting.

A.6.1 Firms operating in multiple jurisdictions with formula apportionment

Consider a company with plants in two jurisdictions, 1 and 2. As a ﬁrst step, we assume
that there is just one type of labor.48 Employment (capital) in jurisdiction j is denoted

by Lj (Kj), j = 1, 2. The wage rate is the same in both plants. After-tax proﬁts of the
company are

i = F (K1, K2,L1, L2)(1 − τi) − (1 − τi)w[L1 + L2] − (1 − ατi)r[K1 + K2]
P F A

Assume that the tax apportionment formula is based on payroll as the only appor-
tionment factor.49 Given that there is a uniform wage rate in the two plants, the proﬁt

tax rate is given by

τi =

τ1L1 + τ2L2

L1 + L2

.

(31)

The eﬀect of a tax rate change in one jurisdiction on the ﬁrm’s eﬀective proﬁt tax

rate τ , given the level of employment, is

∂τi
∂τj

=

Lj

L1 + L2

,

j = 1, 2

47 This result holds in models of monopsonistic wage setting with constant labor supply elasticities. If

this assumption is relaxed, the result on tax shifting is theoretically ambiguous.

48 The case for two skill types is discussed below.
49 This is the case for the LBT in Germany. In the US, apportionment for state taxes is based on

payroll, sales, and assets, see Su´arez Serrato and Zidar (2016).

46

where τj is the tax rate of jurisdiction j.

Assume that wages are set via collective bargaining which takes place at the ﬁrm-

level, not at the plant-level, and that wages paid to workers of a given skill group are the

same in the two plants. The objective function of the skill type k union is now given by

Z F A = (L1 + L2)(w − w) = (L1 + L2)sF A.

The outcome of the bargaining process is given by

sF A∗, L∗

where

ΩF A = λ ln Z F A

The variable λ ∈ (0, 1) stands for the relative bargaining power of the union. The

ﬁrst order condition for the wage rate yields

where

in the tax rate is given by

∂sF A∗
∂τj

= −λ

(1 − α)r(K1 + K2)Lj
(L1 + L2)2(1 − τj)2 ≤ 0.

This implies:

Result 8: Formula apportionment and ﬁrm-level bargaining: In ﬁrms with plants in

many jurisdictions and homogeneous labor, where corporate taxation is based on formula

apportionment, wages are set via collective bargaining at the ﬁrm-level, and capital costs

are less than fully deductible, an increase in the corporate tax rate in one jurisdiction

decreases wages in the entire ﬁrm. If employment in the jurisdiction that changes the tax

rate is small, relative to employment in the ﬁrm as a whole, the tax eﬀect is also small.

Assume, for instance, that municipality 1 has a higher tax rate than municipality
2. The eﬀect of an increase in the wage of the high skilled wh on the tax burden will

depend on whether this increases the payroll share of the high tax municipality, or that

of the low tax municipality. If the share of high skilled is higher in jurisdiction 1, so that

> 0, the tax rate τi will increase, and vice versa. The eﬀect of a wage change

on the proﬁt tax rate a ﬁrm eﬀectively pays is therefore generally ambiguous.

Once again assuming ﬁrm-level collective bargaining and homogeneous wages for a

skill group across plants, the objective function of the skill type k union is now given by

Z F Ak = (Lk

The key diﬀerence between this case and that with homogeneous labor is that a wage

change now aﬀects the eﬀective tax rate. It thus inﬂuences the outcome of union-ﬁrm

bargaining. For instance, if a higher wage increases the eﬀective tax rate, which implies

Φwk < 0, the wage premium achieved by the union will be smaller, other things equal, and
vice versa. Equation (32) implicitly deﬁnes the two ﬁrm-speciﬁc wage premiums emerging
from the bargaining process as functions of the type sF Ak∗ = sF Ak∗(τi, τj, T, Lk∗
j ...).
Diﬀerentiating (32) shows that the change in the local corporate tax rate on wages is, in

i , Lk∗

general, ambiguous.

A.6.2

Income shifting

Income shifting to avoid taxes may occur in diﬀerent forms. Multinational ﬁrms can use

debt ﬁnancing or transfer pricing to shift proﬁts across national borders. Income shifting

may also occur between diﬀerent tax bases within a country. For instance, ﬁrm owners

may shift income between the corporate and the personal income tax base by changing

wages paid to family members. We discuss the two cases in turn.

International income shifting. Assume that the ﬁrm’s proﬁts are given by

ij = piFi(Ki, Lh
P S

i , Ll

k wk

i Lk

i (1 − τj) − (1 − αjτj)riKi + θijSi − c(Si). (33)

i)(1 − τj) −(cid:80)

The variable Si is income shifted from the proﬁt tax base to the personal income tax base
of the ﬁrm owners, which may be positive or negative, θij is the tax beneﬁt per unit of
income shifted and c(Si) is a convex shifting cost function.50 Proﬁt maximization factor

50 Here we assume that proﬁt shifting is carried out by changing the wages of ﬁrm owners working in
the ﬁrm or family members of the ﬁrm owner. This implies that si would be reported as wage income.
Another way of shifting income is to provide capital in the form of debt, rather than equity. Many
countries have introduced anti-tax-avoidance legislation, which limits income shifting. We therefore take

49

input decisions lead to the usual marginal productivity conditions, and optimal income
shifting implies c(cid:48)(Si) = θij so that the proﬁt-maximizing amount of shifted income S∗
i
can be expressed as a function of the tax beneﬁt S∗
i > 0. Consider
ﬁrst the case of a multinational company which is able to shift income abroad. If the ﬁrm

i (θij), with S∗(cid:48)

i = S∗

can do so, for instance, through a foreign subsidiary charging a fully deductible cost to

the domestic parent company, the tax advantage from income shifting is given by θij =
τj − τf , where τf is the foreign proﬁt tax rate. Assume that wages in the multinational
ﬁrm are determined by ﬁrm-level bargaining. In this case, the wage premium generated

by union ﬁrm bargaining is given by

The right-hand side of (35) is increasing in Si (given that Si = S∗

i ), which implies
that the decline in the rent accruing to labor is smaller, the higher the equilibrium level

of income shifting. This yields

Result 9 International income shifting: If ﬁrms engage in international income

shifting and wages are set by ﬁrm-level bargaining, the decline in the rent accruing to

labor caused by a higher corporate tax decreases as the equilibrium level of income shifting

increases.

National income shifting. We now consider the possibility of domestic income shifting

between the proﬁt tax base and wage income. In this case the tax advantage from income
shifting is given by θij = φjτj − tpi, where tpi is the marginal tax rate on wage income of

into account costs of income shifting. This can be interpreted as the cost of hiring tax consultants or the
cost of concealing income shifting. For notational simplicity we assume that shifting costs are not tax
deductible.

eﬀectively proﬁt distributions, so that wage bargaining plays no role for them. Assume

observed change in the wages paid out by the ﬁrm would equal(cid:80)

> 0 increases reported wages. Thus if income shifting

to higher corporate taxes. This may be summarized as

Result 10 National income shifting: If ﬁrms shift income between the proﬁt tax

base and the labor income tax base, a higher corporate tax rate will lead to a smaller

decline in reported wages than in the absence of income shifting. Wages may even increase.

Unfortunately, we cannot test this mechanism directly with our data because we do

not know whether there are employees who are members of the owner family.

B Institutional background

B.1 German business taxes

In 2007, proﬁt taxes accounted for about 6.2% of total tax revenue (including social se-
curity) in Germany (OECD, 2015).51

In terms of tax revenues, the LBT is the most

important proﬁt tax, accounting for about 60–70% of total proﬁt tax revenues from cor-

porate ﬁrms. Overall, the share of proﬁt tax revenues from local taxes is relatively high

in Germany compared with other countries.

In the US, for instance, state and local

corporate taxes together account only for about 20% of total corporate taxes (NCSL,

2009). In addition, the LBT is the most important source of ﬁnancing at the disposal of

municipalities, generating roughly three quarters of municipal tax revenue.

As mentioned in Section 2, there are two other proﬁt taxes in Germany, the corporate

income tax (CIT), which applies to corporations, and the personal income tax (PIT),

which applies to non-corporate ﬁrms. We discuss the most important features of these

two taxes in turn.

Corporate income tax. The rate of the nationwide corporate income tax, τCIT , has
undergone several changes in recent years. Until 2000, a split rate imputation system

existed in Germany, where retained proﬁts were subject to a tax rate of 45% in 1998 and

40% in 1999 and 2000. Distributed proﬁts were taxed at a rate of 30% from 1998 to 2000.

As of 2001, retained and distributed proﬁts were taxed equally at 25% (26.5% in 2003).

In 2008, τCIT was lowered to 15%. In all years, a so-called solidarity surcharge (to ﬁnance
the costs of reuniﬁcation), soli, of 5.5% of the corporate tax rate was added.

There are two steps to calculating the total statutory tax rate for corporate ﬁrms.

First, LBT and CT rates are added. Second, the deduction of the LBT payments from

the tax base has to be taken into account. The statutory tax rate for corporate ﬁrms,
τ corp, from 1998 to 2007, is τ corp = τCIT ·(1+soli)+tf ed
LBT ·θmun
the equation is equal to 1, as the LBT can no longer be deducted from the tax base.

. Since 2008, the denominator of

LBT ·θmun

1+tf ed

LBT

LBT

Personal income tax. Non-corporate ﬁrms (Personengesellschaften) are subject to

the progressive personal income tax (on operating proﬁts assigned to the proprietor).
Non-corporate ﬁrms have an LBT allowance of 24,500 euros and a reduced tf ed
LBT for small
for every 12,000 euros exceeding the allowance of
non-corporate ﬁrms prior to 2008:

51 This is below the OECD average of about 10.6% (US: 10.8%, UK: 9.4%). Part of this relatively low
share of proﬁt taxes is due to the rather high share of social insurance contributions (SIC) in Germany.
If SIC are excluded, the share in total taxes is about 11.5%. A high share of unincorporated ﬁrms in
Germany is a second factor. These ﬁrms pay PIT, in addition to the LBT, and the OECD does not
classify PIT as proﬁt taxes.

52

24,500 euros, tf ed
LBT was raised by one percentage point so that the full basic federal rate
of 5.0% had to be paid only for taxable income exceeding 72,500 euros. The tax rate for
a non-corporate ﬁrms τ non−corp from 1998 to 2007, is τ non−corp = τP IT ·(1+soli)+tf ed
LBT ·θmun
LBT ×1.8
The denominator of the equation shows that a ﬁxed share of the LBT liabilities can be
LBT · 1.8 · Y from
deducted from the personal income tax base. This share amounted to tf ed
2001 to 2007 and tf ed

LBT · 3.8 · Y from 2008 onwards.

B.2 German labor market institutions

Traditionally, German labor unions have been very inﬂuential.52 Collective bargaining

agreements (CBAs) at the sector-level are the most important mechanism for wage de-

termination. Nevertheless, there has been a signiﬁcant decline in bargaining coverage. In

West (East) Germany, CBA coverage decreased from 76% (63%) in 1998 to 65% (51%) in

2009. The share of workers covered by sectoral agreements fell from 68% (52%) to 56%
(38%) (Ellguth, Gerner and Stegmaier, 2012).53 In addition to sector-level CBA, some

ﬁrms have ﬁrm-level agreements, while other ﬁrms are not covered by a CBA and rely on

individual contracts with each employee.

The average duration of a CBA increased from 12 months in 1991 to 22 months in

2011. Usually, negotiations take place in the ﬁrst half of a year. Firms may pay wages

above those negotiated in CBAs. Except for a few industries, there was no legal minimum

wage in Germany during our period of analysis. However, the social security and welfare

system provides an implicit minimum wage and CBAs ensure that wages are above that

level.

52 See Dustmann et al. (2014) for an overview and analysis of the development of German labor market

institutions during our period of investigation.

53 Coverage rates vary by industry: collective bargaining is slightly above average in the manufacturing
sector, while the highest coverage is in the public sector and the lowest in ICT, agriculture and restaurant
industries. Overall, union coverage rates in Germany are lower than in other European countries – except
the UK and some Eastern European countries – but higher than in the US (Du Caju et al., 2008).

53

C Descriptive Statistics

Jurisdictional changes Analogously to Figure 1, Figure C.1 shows the cross-sectional

and time variation in LBT rates for the full sample of municipalities, including municipali-

ties that underwent a jurisdictional change. The right panel clearly shows that the number

of tax changes for these merged municipalities is relatively high. However, the variation in

tax rates is artiﬁcial and related to the way we impute tax rates. As described in Section

2.2, the wage data contains geographical information for the jurisdictional boundaries

as of December 31, 2010.

In order to match the tax data, we have to bring it to the

same boundaries. This generates artiﬁcial variation in tax rates, as we need to calculate

population weighted average tax rates for those merged jurisdictions.

Consequently, we ﬁnd a large number of (small) tax changes for East German mu-

nicipalities. Table C.3 shows that on average 12.4% of the municipalities change their

tax rate per year. Among the merged municipalities, however, the share is 33% (with

a much smaller average change). Given this measurement error in tax rate changes, we

focus on non-merged municipalities in our baseline analysis (and check whether results

for merged and non-merged municipalities diﬀer). Due to this restriction, we are left with

about 10,000 municipalities and 18,000 tax changes for identiﬁcation (instead of 11,441

municipalities with about 27,000 partly artiﬁcial tax changes).

of tax increases and large tax increases for all, non-merged and merged municipalities
from 1993 to 2012. Large increases are deﬁned as the top 25% of the tax increase
distribution, that is an increase of the business tax rate of 1.1 percentage points or
more.

workers whose wages have never been right-censored at the ceiling for social security contributions. In
speciﬁcation (8), part-time workers are added to the full-time worker sample.

regression model (3) with the log individual wage as dependent variables for diﬀerent worker types as
indicated in the table. The heterogeneous eﬀects are estimated by interacting the LBT rate with dummy
variables for diﬀerent ﬁrms types. Coeﬃcients measure the wage elasticity with respect to the net-of-

Source: Own calculations based on Piketty and Saez (2007) for the US-2004 and Bach, Beznoska and
Steiner (2016) for Germany-2015. Notes: This table shows the average income tax rates for the bottom
90%, top 10% and top 1% of the market income distribution. The total tax rates are decomposed into
personal and corporate income tax rates (PIT and CIT). The CIT for Germany includes the LBT. The
“ratio” column reports the ratio of the top tax rate (top 10% or top 1%) to the tax rate for the bottom
90% as a measure of progressivity. Panel A reports tax rates under the incidence assumption of Piketty
and Saez (2007), i.e. the full corporate tax incidence being on capital income. Panels B and C report
two counterfactuals with 50% (100%) of the incidence on wages. Note that formula (4) calculates the
share of the tax burden borne by workers in terms of welfare – as discussed in Section 3.2. Given that the
back-of-the-envelope calculation reported in this table is meant for illustrative purposes only, we assume
here for simplicity reasons that 50% (100%) of the eﬀective tax burden is shifted onto workers. In both
counterfactuals, the wage incidence is only aﬀecting wages of workers in the the bottom 90% (in line with
the heterogeneous eﬀects that we ﬁnd).
