We provide evidence that some profitable insider stock selling is motivated by public
information. At firms that disclose having concentrated sales relationships,
insiders
appear to sell their own stock profitably based on public information about their principal
customers. Supplier insiders also sell more stock when public information about their
customers' recent returns and earnings surprises suggests they will earn larger profits.
These results are stronger when outside investor attention could be lower. Outside of this
setting, insiders engage in a higher proportion of routine sales and their sales are less
profitable. We do not find similar patterns for insider purchases.

data results in strong evidence of informed stock sales, too.

information, this suggests that insiders generally do not
respect the legal prohibitions on using inside information
to make trading decisions.3 We evaluate whether an
alternative explanation can account for the abnormal
returns earned by insiders. We pose a hypothesis of
attentive insider trading informed by public information.
That is, we hypothesize that corporate insiders pay close
attention to public information that is relevant to their
firms and earn profits by trading when outside investors
are relatively inattentive.

We explore insider trading in a setting where attentive
trading could be distinguished from illegal trading. It is
where firms have disclosed that other individual public
companies account for a large fraction of their sales (i.e.,
where suppliers are economically linked to their principal
customers). Supplier insiders' opportunities to trade on

public information should be enhanced in this setting. Cohen
and Frazzini (2008) and Menzly and Ozbas (2010) argue that
outside investors are limited in their ability to understand
the full
impact of public information across firms and
industries, and they show that this leads to return predict-
ability across economically linked firms.4 Cohen and Frazzini
(2008), in particular, show that investor inattention allows
lagged abnormal returns to principal customers to predict
their suppliers' returns.
In this paper, we test whether
customers' lagged returns and their information disclosures
to the market (which are public information at the time of
trading) explain supplier insiders' trading decisions and the
abnormal returns that they earn. Although this is not the
only setting in which insiders could trade profitably on
public information, it is one in which opportunities should
be particularly acute. Therefore, the evidence of attentive
trading could contrast more starkly compared with trading
outside of this context.

Our hypothesis is grounded in an expectation that
corporate insiders are among the most attentive traders of
their own stocks. They have undiversified economic stakes in
their firms, including both their current securities holdings
and their future income, giving them high incentives to
monitor developments that affect their firms' prospects. In
addition, the nature of their jobs is to be informed about
market developments that affect their firms as they work to
maximize firm value. Corporate insiders at economically
linked suppliers could, therefore, quickly recognize profitable
trading opportunities when they observe public information
about their large customers such as recent stock returns,
earnings announcements, and corporate press releases.5 As a
result, insiders at these firms could have increased opportu-
nities to trade profitably on public information beyond that
which is available to insiders at other firms.

Taken as a whole, our results suggest that some profit-
able insider stock sales are motivated by public informa-
tion. We first show that insiders' sales are more profitable
at economically linked suppliers, suggesting that these
insiders possess some informational advantage. Interest-
ingly, though, their purchases, although profitable in this
setting, are followed by similar return patterns when
strong supply chain links are not reported. The asymmetry
of this finding supports a conclusion that insiders' sales are
at times motivated by public information. To see why, it is
useful to consider the different incentives insiders face
when they sell stock versus when they purchase it. As
argued by prior researchers, there is significantly more
litigation risk associated with selling stock. If an insider
withholds negative information when he trades, other
investors would clearly be harmed if they purchase at an
inflated price. Selling by insiders when their stock is

overvalued could also be used as evidence in a suit
claiming fraudulent financial reporting. However,
if an
insider withholds positive information and purchases
stock, the only harm is to other investors who could have
sold and missed out on potential gains if the good news
had already been released. But as others point out, it is less
likely that shareholders will bring a successful derivative
lawsuit against insiders when their only losses are best
described as opportunity costs.6

Given the asymmetric litigation risk, a reasonable
interpretation of our results is that the higher levels of
profitable insider selling in this context is driven by the
greater abundance of opportunities to trade profitably on
public information. The comparably strong profitability of
insider purchases across settings suggests that any increased
opportunities to trade on public information in the supply
chain context is not incrementally useful when insiders are
less deterred from exploiting private information.7

To conduct our analysis, we collect a sample of 1,858
firms (6,939 firm-years) that report the existence of large
principal customers during the period 1986–2010 (eco-
nomically linked suppliers). We compare insider trading
activity at these firms across years when they do and do
not report these strong economic links. We also contrast
the returns to insider trading at the economically linked
firms to those at 5,118 other firms that never report these
relations (never-linked firms). Our focus is on trades that
are nonroutine, because Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorski
(2012) show that these trades are most likely to be
motivated by an informational advantage.

We start by evaluating the profitability of insiders' trades.
Abnormal returns following nonroutine insider sale months
are significantly larger at economically linked suppliers. For
example, NYSE size decile-adjusted one-month cumulative
abnormal returns (CARs) following insider sales at economic-
ally linked suppliers are  0.67% compared with  0.16% at
linked suppliers during non-linked years and  0.32% at
never-linked firms. The significance of this result is con-
firmed in multivariate tests controlling for market returns,
firm size, book-to-market equity value, and stock return
momentum. In addition, a larger proportion of trade months
are profitable when strong economic links exist. In contrast,
insiders' stock purchases are profitable, on average, regard-
less of the existence of a strong supplier–customer relation-
ship. For example,
insiders' purchases are followed by
monthly abnormal returns of 0.92% when an economic link
is present and 0.80% when it is not, and these two values are
not significantly different.

We provide a variety of additional tests to help further
identify whether insiders' trades in this setting are moti-
vated by private or public information. For one, we show

4 Numerous researchers argue for both the existence and rationality
of limited investor attention to information relevant to asset prices
(Hong, Torous, and Valkanov, 2007; Bacchetta and Van Wincoop, 2010;
Peng and Xiong, 2006). Huang and Liu (2007), in particular, show that
investor inattention can lead to cross-sectional return predictability. For
the social psychology foundations of limited attention theories, see
Kahneman (1973) and Fiske and Taylor (1991).

5 Throughout the paper we refer to stock sales as profitable if they
precede negative abnormal returns, as the insider avoids losses by selling.

6 See, for instance, Skinner (1994), Brochet (2010), and Chen, Martin,

and Wang (2012).

7 Other research suggests that attentive institutional

investors
exploit information spillovers when investing in related firms (see, for
example, Cohen and Frazzini, 2008; Menzly and Ozbas, 2010; and Huang
and Kale, 2012). However, because the mutual fund holdings data are
reported at quarterly frequency, they are generally neither able to
evaluate the profitability of specific investments nor establish the direc-
tion of causation between trading and returns.

that supplier insiders do not sell stock profitably in the
first year of a concentrated supplier–customer relation-
ship, which could precede their disclosure of the relation-
ship to the market. If supplier insiders traded on private
information about their customers, similar or even larger
abnormal returns would be expected during these years
because outside investors are less likely to understand the
impact of information across economic links before they
are disclosed. The subsequent analyses focus on trades by
supplier insiders once the relations with principal custo-
mers have been disclosed. We find that the abnormal
returns following these trades are a function of the lagged
returns to the large principal customers. Supplier insiders'
sales earn significant abnormal profits on average only
when the lagged abnormal returns of their principal
customers were negative. In addition, the abnormal profits
earned on sales are a function of the magnitude of the
customers'
lagged returns. Supplier insiders also earn
greater profits when the market could be less attentive
to the economic link between suppliers and principal
customers. For example, the abnormal returns following
their sales are more pronounced when fewer analysts
cover the suppliers. Their sales also become less profitable
as the duration of the supplier–customer relationship
grows. This is to be expected if insiders are trading on
public information because the market should learn about
the cross-firm return predictability over time and the
faster recognition by outside investors should limit insi-
ders' profitable trading opportunities.8

The next issue we focus on is whether supplier insiders
trade more when they have opportunities to profit on
public information. We find that the overall
level of
nonroutine insider trading is higher at economically linked
suppliers than at other firms, suggesting that more oppor-
tunities exist to trade profitably in this setting.
It is
reasonable to expect attentive insiders to notice market
signals about their customers' prospects and to react when
they think the market does not fully appreciate the impact
of these developments on their own future performance.
We find that insiders at economically linked suppliers are
more likely to trade when publicly available information
about their customers indicates their trades will be profit-
able. In the first set of tests along these lines, we show that
supplier insiders are more likely to sell (purchase) stock
when the lagged returns to their principal customers are
lower (higher), a situation that predicts they will earn
abnormal returns (Cohen and Frazzini, 2008).

Moreover, a strong relation exists between supplier
insiders' stock sales and their customers' specific commu-
nications to the market. Supplier insiders trade their own
stock around the time their principal customers announce
earnings, and their trades are in the direction one would
expect, given the impact of the unexpected earnings
component on their own firm value. The level of trading
is also greater when other investors could be less attentive,
in particular when the earnings are released on Fridays.

8 None of the results discussed in this paragraph holds for purchases,
with the exception of the fact that supplier insider purchases are
profitable only when lagged customer returns are positive.

Other investors could be less attentive at the end of the
week and, therefore, slower to incorporate new informa-
tion into the suppliers' stock prices (DellaVigna and Pollet,
2009). To get a sense of the economic significance of these
results, we find increases in the odds of a supplier insider
sale of 425% (a 6.50% increase relative to the unconditional
odds of a sale of 1.53%) following a large negative earnings
surprise announced by a principal customer on a Friday. In
addition, given a sale, supplier insiders sell an additional
19,190 shares under these circumstances.

We conclude with robustness tests designed to evalu-
ate alternative explanations for our findings, including the
possibility that our results are driven by trading on private
information. We find that the strong relation between
supplier insider selling and the information content of
their customers' earnings announcements does not hold in
the two days immediately preceding the announcements.
However, for purchases, we find similar trading patterns in
this period as we find for the days following customer
earnings announcements. A final alternative we consider is
that insiders use public announcements to camouflage
trades based on other, unrelated, private information.
We analyze the trades of a subset of supplier insiders who
were already trading prior to their customers' earnings
announcements and in the direction that would be expected
given the content of the pending release. For the case of
stock sales, we continue to find that trading immediately
following the customers' announcements is related to its
content. This would not be expected if they are trading on
this particular information ahead of time. Also, given that
they are already trading, it seems unlikely that they are
waiting for a public news release to camouflage trading
motivated by other private information.9 This relation does
not hold for purchases.

As a whole, our analysis is consistent with a conclusion
that some profitable insider selling in this setting is
motivated by public information. This conclusion is sup-
ported in the case of supplier insider sales because of the
robust evidence that public information explains the
returns that are earned, that selling patterns following
customer announcements are a function of
the new
information conveyed, and that the level of nonroutine
trading and returns earned by supplier insiders are not
matched outside of this setting. However, the evidence
does not support the same conclusion for stock purchases.
Less evidence exists regarding the relation between public
information and the returns following purchases, insider
selling patterns are similar immediately before and after
customer earnings announcements, and insiders earn
similar returns outside of this setting.

9 We cannot be certain whether insiders are ever motivated solely by
public information when they trade, or if their actions reflect considera-
tion of a mosaic of public and private signals. Assuming they have access
to both sets of signals, it seems unlikely that insiders would completely
ignore one set when they trade. Even if one has the best of intentions,
certainly insiders' expectations of the impact of new public information
on their firms' values would be colored by the private information they
possess. Regardless, our analysis suggests that it is the addition of public
information to an insiders' information set that often leads them to trade.

It is beyond the scope of this paper to estimate the
relative levels of illegal trading on private information
versus attentive trading on public information in our
markets. However, we offer some thoughts on this ques-
tion in Section 4 with a focus on insights from prior
research that could be useful for calibrating expectations
about the prevalence of each.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In
Section 2 we discuss the data and methodologies used in
this study. Section 3 contains the empirical results. Finally,
in Section 4 we conclude with a summary of the results
and discuss the possible extent of attentive insider trading
in our markets.

2. Data and methodology

The data for our analyses are obtained from several
sources. We first identify firms that sell a large fraction of
their output to individual principal customers. Under US
securities laws, public companies are required to report
annually any customer that accounts for more than 10% of
their annual sales, and these disclosures are included in
the Compustat Customer Segments database. Extracting
the supplier–customer relationships from this database
required a significant amount of hand-matching. The
reporting companies often abbreviate the names of their
large customers, so each entry had to be compared with
the full company name listed in Compustat. We matched
the customer names conservatively, and we were careful
to check company websites and the Business Week com-
pany profiles to exclude questionable matches.

This analysis also requires insider trading data. These data
are retrieved from Table 1 of the Thomson Reuters insider
database, which reports stock transactions by insiders at
publicly traded US firms.10 We conduct our main tests on
trades by the broad cross section of insiders that must report
their transactions, and we show selected results for subsets
of top officers or directors. Transactions are included in our
analysis if Thomson Reuters has verified their accuracy and
given them a cleanse code of R, H, L, C, or Y.

We exclude trades that can be characterized as routine
because these trades are unlikely to be motivated by
information. Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorski (2012) charac-
terize insiders as routine traders if they trade in the same
calendar month in three consecutive years, and they show
that trades by these insiders do not predict abnormal
returns. We follow their definition for routine traders
and exclude all
trades made by these individuals.
The remaining trades covered in our analysis are, there-
fore, reasonably characterized as nonroutine. We also
exclude insider trades related to options transactions,

10 The Thomson Reuters Financial Network Insider Filing Data
provides information on executives' stock and derivative transactions.
These transactions must be reported to the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Forms 3, 4, 5, and 144. Insiders are required to file Form 3
to report initial beneficial ownership of shares, Form 4 to report changes
in beneficial holdings, Form 5 to report annual changes in beneficial
ownership, and Form 144 to declare their intention to sell restricted
shares. Stock transactions are reported in Table 1 of these forms. Officers,
directors, and beneficial owners of more than 10% of a class of a
company's equity securities are required to report their transactions.

which leaves us with a sample of nonroutine insider open
market sales and purchases. For most of our tests, the
trading observation is measured at the monthly level. A
sale month (purchase month) is defined as a calendar
month in which an insider reported trading at least once
and where the trades resulted in a net increase (decrease)
in ownership.

Evaluating abnormal returns requires stock market
returns and firm characteristics. Balance sheet and income
statement data are collected from Compustat, and stock
returns are collected from the Center for Research in
Security Prices (CRSP). We focus our study on common
stocks only (CRSP share codes 10 and 11). We eliminate
illiquid stocks by dropping those with prices below $5 or
market capitalizations below $100 million. Further, to
eliminate the effect of outliers, we winsorize all variables
at the 99% and 1% levels.

Combining the economically linked suppliers, the insi-
der trading data, stock returns, and firm characteristics
resulted in a final sample of 1,858 linked firms and 17,180
unique trade months at those firms (11,805 net sale
months and 5,375 net purchase months). Our control
observations consist of all other firms for which we have
the available CRSP, Compustat, and insider trading data but
that do not report the existence of principal customers.
The control sample includes 6,330 non-linked firms
(including never-linked firms and linked firms in non-
linked years) with 128,942 unique trade months (82,905
net sale months and 46,037 net purchase months).

Our main empirical strategy is to test for differences in
abnormal stock returns following trades at economically
linked suppliers versus those at other firms. To establish
the robustness of our results, we calculate abnormal
returns in a couple of ways. The first and simplest method
consists of comparing stock returns over the calendar
month subsequent to trading months with the calendar
month returns on the appropriate size decile portfolio of
firms based on NYSE size breakpoints
(size decile
portfolio-adjusted CAR). This method is useful because it
accounts for market-related risk factors that affect firms of
similar size during the same one-month period.

We also determine abnormal returns in a regression
framework. We regress excess one month returns follow-
ing trade months onto the equal-weighted market return
and other variables that account for additional risk factors,
including the firm's stock market value, book-to-market
value of equity, and prior supplier stock returns.11 This
method mimics that of Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorski
(2012). We also introduce a variety of explanatory vari-
ables derived from the lagged three-month abnormal
returns to the suppliers' principal customers. In the case
that a supplier has more than one principal customer, we
use the equal weighted average of the principal customers'
returns in our regression analysis. We are careful to control
for the lagged abnormal return to the supplier firm over

11 Excess returns are defined as the monthly return to a firm's stock
minus the one-month risk-free rate as reported on Ken French's website:
http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.
html. We confirm that all of our results are robust to using total return
and size decile-adjusted CARs as the dependent variable.

Table 1
Summary statistics.

This table reports summary statistics for the sample firm-months of nonroutine insider trades from January 1986 to December 2010. The sample is
divided into linked firm insider sale (purchase) months in Panel A (Panel C) and non-linked firm insider sale (purchase) months in Panel B (Panel D). The
variable B/M is the previous year-end book-to-market equity ratio. The variable Size is the previous year-end market value (in millions). Trade days per
firm-month, traders per firm-month, and firms per month are also reported. If a firm-month contains both an insider net sale and an insider net purchase,
then the observation is removed from the sample.

the same horizon to account for any industry-wide effect
that could codetermine these returns.

The second part of our analysis focuses on whether
public information about principal customers predicts the
trading activity of supplier insiders. We conduct limited
dependent variable regressions predicting trading at
the economically linked suppliers as a function of their
principal customers' past abnormal returns and unex-
pected earnings. The analyst
forecasts and earnings
announcements for this part of our analysis are obtained
from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (I/B/E/S)
database. We use a normalized measure of quarterly
earnings surprise from DellaVigna and Pollet
(2009),
constructed as

SUEt;k ¼ actual earningst;k  expected earningst;k

;

ð1Þ

pricet;k

where SUEt,k is the standardized unexpected earnings
(SUE) announced by company k for quarter t, actual
earningst,k is the actual earnings per share for company
k in quarter t, and expected earningst,k is the correspond-
ing median of all analyst earnings per share forecasts
issued closest in time to the earnings announcement date
but not more than 90 days prior to the fiscal period end.
The earnings surprise is scaled by Pricet,k, which is the
stock price of company k five days prior to the earnings
announcement date in quarter t. For our analysis, we
calculate earnings surprises for our firms' principal cus-
tomers, as well as for the other firms in the same industry
[Standard industrial classification (SIC) 4] as
those

customers. In unusual cases in which suppliers report
more than one principal customer and multiple custo-
mers report their earnings on the same day (3.9% of
observations), we take the average of the firms' SUE.

Table 1 contains summary statistics for our sample.
Economically linked suppliers in the sample are slightly
smaller than non-linked firms. This makes sense because it
is easier for smaller firms to have one customer account
for 10% or more of sales. The mean market capitalization of
linked firms with insider sales is $4.4 billion, and the mean
market capitalization of non-linked firms with insider
sales is $4.8 billion. The book-to-market equity value of
linked suppliers is marginally higher than for the control
firms. These differences highlight the importance of con-
trolling for these characteristics in a regression format.
Linked suppliers with insider sales have slightly higher
nonroutine traders and trade days per firm-month, which
suggests more profitable trading opportunities could be
found at these firms. In contrast, this relation is reversed
for insider purchases.

Fig. 1 shows the duration of the supplier–customer
relationships in our sample. The plot illustrates a general
decrease in the number of links as the duration increases.
The maximum link duration is 25 years, and the average
duration is 2.66 years. For most of our tests, we include
insider trading months in the analysis only if they occur
after the supplier–customer link has been disclosed, such
that the link can be characterized as public information.
For comparison purposes, we also present one regression
of returns following trades that occur during the first year

the Fama and French 17 industry classifications is reported
in Table 2. The economically linked suppliers are dispro-
portionately concentrated in the machinery and business
equipment industry and the drugs, soap, perfumes, and
tobacco industry. The machinery and business equipment
suppliers are typically producers of parts for machinery
and computers (e.g., SanDisk Corp and Integrated Device
Technology), and the drugs, soap, perfumes, and tobacco
suppliers are predominately pharmaceutical companies
(e.g., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Alexza Pharma-
ceuticals Inc.). As would be expected, relatively few sup-
plier firms are retail stores and financial institutions. The
main results of the paper are robust to the exclusion of all
financial firms, but for completeness we include them in
the analysis.

3. Empirical results

We analyze insider trading in a setting where an
increased potential exists for insiders to earn returns by
trading on public information. The first part of our analysis
focuses on the determinants of returns following insider
transactions at firms that have large principal customers.
The second part of this analysis focuses on the conditions
that lead insiders at these economically linked suppliers
to trade.

3.1. Returns following insider trades at economically linked
suppliers

We first examine the relation between strong supplier–
customer relationships and the returns following insider
trading months. We compare insider trading returns at
economically linked suppliers with those at other non-
linked firms. We also make comparisons with insider
returns at two mutually exclusive groups within the non-
linked firms: the non-linked years for firms that report

Industry classifications of suppliers and principal customers.

This table reports the percentage of economically linked suppliers in
our sample that are associated with each of the Fama and French 17
industry classifications. The table also shows the percentage difference
between the distribution of non-linked firms and linked firms. Finally, it
reports the distribution of the principal customers across the Fama and
French 17 industry classifications.

(never-linked firms).

Table 3 presents NYSE size decile-adjusted one-month
CARs following insider trades. The size-adjusted CARs
following insider sales are reported in Panel A. Overall
the results indicate that the returns earned by insiders on
their stock sales are significant when economic links are
present. The CARs following insider sales at economically
linked suppliers on average are  0.671% per month. In
contrast, evidence of profitable insider sales is not very
strong outside of this context. On average, insiders at these

Table 3
Market-adjusted abnormal returns following supplier insider trades.

This table reports the one-month NYSE size decile-portfolio adjusted cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) following months with insider trading. The
CARs for trade months by insiders at economically linked firms are compared with those at non-linked firms and with those at two subsets of this control
group: linked firms during non-linked years and never-linked firms. Panel A contains insider sales, and Panel B contains insider purchases. Column 1
reports results for all insiders. Column 2 reports results for the top-level insiders, who include chief executive officers, chief financial officers, and chief
operating officers. Column 3 reports results for only the directors. Results for all other insiders are reported in Column 4. Standard errors are in parentheses
and significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level are indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

firms earn only 29 basis points ( 0.29% CAR) of abnormal
return over the month following their nonroutine sales.
Breaking the non-linked firms down further, we find
abnormal returns of  0.158% per month at linked firms
during non-linked years and  0.322% per month at never-
linked firms. The differences from the average returns earned
by linked suppliers of 0.513% per month (T-statistic¼3.74)
and 0.349% per month (T-statistic¼3.42), respectively, are
highly significant.
The contrast

in returns is starkest with top-level
officers (chief executive officers, chief financial officers,
and chief operating officers), who are most likely to be
focused on information affecting their firms' future pro-
spects. Top-level officers are also under the spotlight of
regulators and the press, which could motivate them to
avoid trading on private information. Size-adjusted CARs

for top level officers, on average, are  1.230% per month
at linked firms versus only  0.277% at non-linked firms
altogether. Breaking these control observations down
further, the average returns are  0.355% per month at
never-linked firms and 0.359% at linked firms during non-
linked years. The differences in abnormal returns at linked
suppliers compared with these two groups are 0.875%
(T-statistic¼3.28) per month and 1.589% (T-statistic¼
3.67) per month, respectively. Similar patterns are also
apparent for outside directors. These results suggest that
top-level officers and directors are the most skilled at
interpreting and profiting from information about their
customers.

The size-adjusted CARs following insider purchases are
reported in Panel B of Table 3. Consistent with prior
research, average CARs following insider purchases are

Table 4
An analysis of supplier insider trading returns compared with insider trading at other firms.

This table compares cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) following insider sales at economically linked suppliers with those at other firms in a
multivariate regression framework. It also presents regressions of monthly returns following insider sales at economically linked suppliers on control
variables and lagged returns to their principal customers. The dependent variable Excess Rettþ 1 is the one-month excess return following trade month t.
Link is an indicator equal to one if the firm has a principal customer during the given year. Log(Link Duration) is the log of the total number of months
separating the trade month and the first reported relationship with the principal customer. Log(Analyst) is the log of number of analysts covering the
supplier, and Log(Sales) is the log of the percentage of firm sales associated with principal customer. Customer CARt 3,t  1 is the customer three-month
market adjusted return from months t 3 to t 1. Log(Size) is the log of the previous year-end market value. Log(B/M) is the log of the previous year-end
book-to-market equity ratio. CARt  3,t 1 is the supplier's three-month market-adjusted return from months t 3 to t 1, and CARt 12,t 1 is the supplier's
one-year market-adjusted return from months t 12 to t 1. Markettþ 1 is the equal-weighted market return. Panel A contains insider sales, and Panel B
contains insider purchases. Column 2 contains observations from insider trade months in the first year of the supplier–customer relation, and all other
regressions in this table omit observations from insider trades during the first year of the supplier–customer relationship. Columns 1 and 7 contain results
for insider trade months at linked and non-linked firms. Columns 3 and 4 (Columns 5 and 6) contain regression results for insider trade months at linked
firms following three-month positive (negative) lagged customer CARs. Column 8 contains only the regression results for insider trade months at linked
firms. Clustered standard errors at the firm level are in parentheses, and significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level are indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

Fig. 2. Framework for calculating abnormal returns as a function of returns to principal customers.

larger than those following insider sales. However, we do
not find that the abnormal returns following purchases are
greater at economically linked firms. The size-adjusted
CARs for insider purchases on average are 0.922% per
month at linked firms and 0.709% per month at never-
linked firms, a difference of  0.213% (T-statistic¼1.40) per
month. Purchases are more profitable, on average, at
economically linked firms during non-linked years which
are followed by average CARs of 1.398% (5% significance on
the difference). This pattern holds generally across the
different groups of insiders, but the significance of the
differences is lost in the smaller samples.

Our next step is to analyze the returns following insiders'
trades in a multivariate regression framework, in which we
can control for other risk factors and include explanatory
variables to evaluate whether the returns are associated with
public information. This analysis builds on the empirical setup
of Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorski (2012) and is presented in
Table 4 for insiders' sales (Panel A) and insiders' purchases
(Panel B). We follow the framework illustrated in Fig. 2 for this
analysis. Supplier insider trade months are classified as sale
(purchase) months in month t if there is at least one net seller
(purchaser) of shares during that month and no net purcha-
sers (sellers). Supplier excess returns in month tþ1 are
regressed onto explanatory variables. The baseline specifica-
tion (Column 1) includes those risk factors discussed pre-
viously and a dummy indicating that a firm reported an
economic link to a principal customer in that year (Link). The
coefficient on Link in the regression for sales of  0.0037
(T-statistic¼3.31) in Panel A confirms the incremental profit-
ability of these trades at economically linked suppliers. The
similarity of returns following insiders' purchases across the
linked and non-linked settings is also confirmed by the much

smaller and insignificant coefficient on Link in Panel B,
Column 1.

The subsequent regressions in this table explore the
extent to which public information explains insiders'
returns. We first conduct regressions using only those
trades at economically linked suppliers that are executed
in the first year of the reported relationship to a principal
customer. During this year, the relationship might not have
yet been disclosed in public filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). In Panel A, we do not find
evidence of abnormal returns following supplier insiders'
sales during this year (insignificant coefficient of 0.0014 on
the intercept). This could indicate insiders' reluctance to
sell stock on information before the public could be
expected to know the importance of the economic link.
In the regression evaluating purchases, in Panel B, we find
evidence of larger positive abnormal returns during these
years (coefficient of 0.0261 on the intercept), but the result
is not statistically significant. Although not significant, the
point estimate would suggest that insiders take advantage
of the market's lack of knowledge to make greater profits
on purchases. The lack of significance could reflect the
much smaller sample size (N¼1,203).

Next we consider whether insiders' profits can be
explained by public information. We examine the relation
between supplier insiders'
trading profits and public
information about their customers' prior stock returns.
Cohen and Frazzini (2008) show that past customer
returns predict future abnormal returns in the same
direction for their suppliers. The regressions in Columns 3
and 4 of both panels include trades only following positive
lagged three month CARs at the principal customers. Simi-
larly, Columns 5 and 6 present regressions in which trades

D.M. Alldredge, D.C. Cicero / Journal of Financial Economics 115 (2015) 84–101

93

follow negative customer CARs.12 These regressions show
that both sales and purchases are only profitable on average
(with statistical significance) when the lagged customer
returns predict they will be. In particular, sales are only
followed by negative abnormal returns when the lagged
customer returns are also negative (coefficient on the inter-
cept in Panel A Column 5 of  0.0279, significant at the 1%
level); and purchases are only followed by positive abnormal
returns when lagged customer returns are positive (coeffi-
cient on the intercept in Panel B Column 3 of 0.0326,
significant at the 5% level). These abnormal returns are large
in economic terms.13

The magnitude of the returns earned by supplier
insiders on their sales is also a function of the magnitude
of the lagged customer CARs. The coefficient on Customer
CARt 3,t 1 is insignificant when supplier insiders sell stock
following periods of positive customer abnormal returns
(Column 4 in Panel A). However, their profits from sales
following negative customer returns are highly sensitive to
the magnitude of the customers' returns (Column 6 in
Panel A). In contrast, we do not find the same relation for
supplier insider purchases. These results show that insi-
ders' trading profits are a function of the strength of
the public signal when they sell stock, which would not
be expected if
they were trading solely on private
information.

these trading opportunities, we expect

In the final two specifications in this table, we account
for the level of outside investor attention to the supplier–
customer relationship.
In Column 7 of each panel we
include Log(Link Duration), which indicates the length of
the supplier–customer relationship in years. If insiders'
superior returns reflect the sharing of private information
from customers to suppliers, we would expect their profits
to increase over time as relationships strengthen. Alter-
natively, if market inattention to public information gen-
erates
the
abnormal returns to decline over time as the market learns
about return predictability across firms.14 We also include
year fixed effects in this specification to alleviate concerns
that we could pick up a time trend in the returns to insider
trading. We find that the length of the relationship is
positively related to the abnormal returns following sup-
plier insider sales, indicating that the returns are more
negative earlier in the relationship, which lends additional
support to the hypothesis that the insiders' sales are often
motivated by public information. In contrast, we do not
find this relation for supplier insiders' purchases.

In Column 8 we include Log(Analysts) and Log(Sales) to
account for how attentive outside investors could be to the

12 In the case that a supplier firm has multiple principal customers,

the average customer CAR is used in our analysis.

13 To determine whether the abnormal return patterns we find are
driven by risk associated with the existence of a principal supplier–
customer relationship, we conduct similar regressions but with abnormal
returns that are measured following supplier insider trade months
relative to the returns at other supplier return months. The results are
qualitatively unchanged.

14 If suppliers have more than one principal customer, we use in our
analysis the average number of months separating the trade month from
the first reported relationship with each customer as our measure of the
duration of the supplier-customer relationship.

supplier–customer
relationship. Log(Analysts) captures
the number of equity analysts covering the supplier.
We expect the market to be faster to incorporate informa-
tion about principal customers into the suppliers' stock
price when more analysts cover the stock, thus reducing
the profits earned by supplier insiders if they trade on
public information. We find that this is the case for
supplier insiders' sales in Panel A, where the coefficient
on Log(Analysts) is positive and significant, indicating less
negative returns following sales when there is more
attention to the stock. Log(Sales) indicates the percentage
of the suppliers' sales that go to the principal customer.
When the economic link is stronger, the market could pay
more attention. However, we do not find that the strength
of this relation impacts the returns to either insiders'
purchases or sales. Perhaps this non-result reflects the
endogenous choice whether to trade based on the oppor-
tunity for profits.

3.2. What causes insiders at economically linked suppliers
to trade?

The second part of our analysis focuses on the factors
that lead insiders to trade. We begin by investigating
whether the frequency of trading differs depending on
whether firms report having principal customers.
In
Table 5, Panel A, we compare the number of trade months
per year across linked suppliers and non-linked firms.15
We find significantly higher levels of both routine and
nonroutine stock sales at economically linked firms. How-
ever, the difference in nonroutine trading across these
groups of firms is much larger. This leads to a significantly
higher difference-in-differences (the difference in nonrou-
tine stock sale months per year minus the difference in
routine stock sale months per year) of 0.127 trade months
per year for the economically linked suppliers versus other
firms. This pattern does not hold for stock purchases.
Insiders at economically linked suppliers engage in higher
levels of both routine and nonroutine purchases, but the
difference-in-differences is essentially zero.

In Table 5, Panel B, we compare trading patterns at just
the economically linked firms across years with and with-
out reported links. For both sales and purchases, there is a
lower level of routine trading and a higher level of
nonroutine trading in years when the economic links are
reported. The results in this panel suggest that for these
firms, in aggregate, more profitable trading opportunities
arise when these links exist. Because the results are similar
across sales and purchases, they do not provide a clear
indication of the type of information that is available.
Among the possibilities, it could be that supplier insiders
have both more public and private information predicting
returns when these links exist. The increased selling could
reflect trading on public information, but the increased
purchasing could reflect additional trading on private
information, too.

15 Because the ratio of nonroutine trade months per year to routine
trade months per year is undefined for years containing zero routine
trade months, we cannot evaluate a simple ratio of trade types.

The combination of larger abnormal returns following
insider sales and more non-routine trading suggests a higher
prevalence of profitable insider selling overall. To examine
this further, we compare the percentages of trade months
that are profitable across settings. We consider a sale month
to be profitable if it is followed by a negative size-adjusted
CAR in the following month. Insiders at economically linked
suppliers execute 17.6% more profitable sales than unprofita-
ble sales overall and 19.4% more profitable nonroutine sales.
By comparison, the same figures for linked firms in non-
linked years are 6.8% and 12.4%, respectively; and for never
linked firms, they are 10.3% and 9.5%. Chi-square tests show
that the higher proportions of profitable trade months at
linked firms are significantly different from those at the other
two groups at the 1% level.

The final issue we examine is whether public information
about principal customers drives trading by supplier insiders.
Supplier insiders could understand the return predictability
across economically linked firms and trade when they

observe abnormal returns to their customers' stock. Table 6
presents limited dependent variable regressions predicting
trading by supplier insiders. The independent control vari-
ables are the suppliers' market value of equity [Log(Size)],
book-to-market equity [Log(B/M)], the contemporaneous mar-
ket return (Markett), and the three-month lagged abnormal
returns to the supplier (SupplierCARt 3,t 1). The variable of
interest is either the lagged customer abnormal return
(CustomerCARt 3,t 1) or a dummy indicating that the lagged
customer return was negative or positive (CustomerCARt 3,t 1
Negative for predicting sales or CustomerCARt 3,t 1Positive for
predicting purchases). If the coefficients on these variables are
significant, then that would suggest that insiders trade when
public information predicts they will earn profits. We present
both probit regressions that predict whether a supplier
insider traded and Tobit regressions that predict the number
of shares traded. The regressions predicting supplier insider
sales are presented in Columns 1 through 4, and those
predicting purchases are reported in Columns 5 through 8.
The results clearly indicate that supplier insiders trade more
often, and they trade more shares, when their customers'
lagged returns predict that their trades will be profitable. For
example, the marginal effects associated with the coefficients
on CustomerCARt 3,t 1Negative in the probit regression in
Column 2 indicate that supplier insiders are 8.07% more likely
to sell shares when their lagged customer returns were
negative. The same coefficient from the Tobit regression in
Column 4 indicates that, when they do sell stock, they sell
27,290 more shares when their customers' lagged returns
were negative. Similarly, the marginal effects indicate that
when lagged customer returns are positive, they are 3.67%
more likely purchase shares (Column 6); and they purchase
8,308 more shares under those circumstances (Column 8).16
These results are consistent with supplier insiders
trading based on their knowledge of the return relation
between their firm and their customers. Attentive supplier
insiders also could trade around the specific news releases
of their customers. The next part of the analysis, therefore,
offers tests focused on trading immediately around princi-
pal customers' earnings releases. In Table 7 we present
limited dependent variable regressions predicting supplier
insider trading during the two-day window (0,1) around
their customers' earnings releases.17 We remove observa-
tions with confounding supplier earnings announcement
during an approximately three-week window [( 8,8)
trading days]. We are interested in whether supplier
insiders are more likely to trade when customers
announce unexpected earnings, which could predict the
suppliers' own future sales and, therefore, profits. To
control for the fact that insiders' trading decisions could
be driven by general concerns about the future of the
market that are reflected in the earnings of similar firms,
we include as control observations the earnings announce-
ments of all
firms in the same SIC4 industry as the
principal customers (Cust Industry Firm SUE contains the

and Shares Purchased at the 99% level of the nonzero values.

Table 6
Predicting supplier insider trading with lagged customer returns.

This table presents Tobit regressions analyzing the number of shares sold by supplier insiders as a function of lagged customer returns. In Columns 1 and
2 the dependent variable is Sale Indicatort, an indicator equal to one if the firm-month was a net insider sale month. In Columns 3 and 4 the dependent
variable is Shares Soldt, the number of shares sold by all insiders (in thousands of shares) for each firm-month observation. In Columns 5 and 6 the
dependent variable is Purchase Indicatort, an indicator equal to one if the firm-month was a net insider purchase month. In Columns 7 and 8 the dependent
variable is Shares Purchasedt, the number of shares purchased by all insiders (in thousands of shares) for each firm-month observation. The independent
variables are an indicator for negative lagged three-month cumulative abnormal customer returns (Customer CARt  3,t  1 Negative), an indicator for positive
lagged three-month cumulative abnormal customer returns (Customer CARt  3,t  1 Positive), a continuous variable for lagged three-month cumulative
abnormal customer return (Customer CARt 3,t  1), the three-month cumulative abnormal supplier return (Supplier CARt  3,t 1), the equal-weighted stock
market return (Markett), the log of market capitalization for the prior year [Log(Size)], and the log of the book-to-market equity ratio for the prior year [Log
(B/M)]. Standard errors are in parentheses, and significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level are indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

Customer
announcements made by the actual large customers.

These results are presented in Table 7 for supplier insider
sales (Panel A) and purchases (Panel B). The regressions in
Columns 1 through 3 of each panel present probit regres-
sions and Columns 4 through 6 present Tobit regressions
with the same specifications. The results in Panel A provide
strong evidence that supplier insiders' decisions to sell their
stock is impacted by the information in their customers'
earnings releases. The highly significant negative coefficient
in Column 1 on the interaction term Customer*Cust Industry
Firm SUE demonstrates a negative relation between the
customers' SUE and supplier insider sales. In Column 2, the
SUE is replaced by a dummy indicating a negative SUE and
the coefficient on the interaction term Customer*Cust Indus-
try Firm SUE Negative remains highly significant. In Column 3,
the SUE is replaced with a dummy indicating a large shortfall
(below  0.3% of the stock price, which represents approxi-
mately the 10th percentile of earnings surprises). Here the
magnitude of the coefficient on the interaction term Custo-
mer*Cust Industry Firm SUEo  0.3% increases, indicating that
supplier insiders sell more shares in this two-day window
when their customers report large earnings shortfalls. In
terms of marginal significance, the result in Column 2
indicates a 41.60% increase in the odds that a supplier insider
sells shares when its principal customer announces a

negative earnings surprise, and the result in Column 3
indicates that when the surprise is large there is a 58.82%
increase in the odds of a supplier insider sale. In comparison
with the unconditional odds of a supplier insider sale during
one of these two-day windows, these results are economic-
ally significant. These results are also evident in the Tobit
regressions. From the regressions in Columns 5 and 6, we are
able to estimate that, conditional on a sale, supplier insiders
sell 3,353 more shares when their customers announce
disappointing earnings and 4,793 more shares when the
earnings shortfall was large. We obtain similar results for
supplier insider purchases in Panel B when using dummy
variables to control for positive customer earnings surprises
(Columns 2, 3, 5, and 6), although the result is not evident
when using a continuous customer SUE variable (Columns 1
and 4).

To conclude this analysis, we present a number of
robustness tests in Table 8. These additional tests focus
on two issues: (1) whether the decision to trade around
customer earnings announcements is a function of how
quickly the market incorporates information into prices,
and (2) to what extent we can be confident that the
supplier insiders are trading on public information. To
address the first issue, we evaluate the same regressions
reported in Table 7 but limit the sample to earnings
announcements made on Fridays. DellaVigna and Pollet
(2009) show that investors are generally less attentive to
corporate announcements made at the end of the week, by
showing that post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) is

Table 7
Predicting supplier insider trading with customer earnings surprises.

This table presents probit and Tobit regressions predicting insider trading at economically linked suppliers as a function of their customers' earnings
announcements. The dependent variables in Panel A are Sale Indicator and Shares Sold. In Columns 1, 2, and 3 of Panel A, Sale Indicator is equal to one if
there is at least one supplier insider sale during the window (0,1) days around an earnings announcement by a principal customer or another firm in the
same industry. In Columns 4, 5, and 6 of Panel A, Shares Sold is the total volume of shares sold by supplier insiders (in thousands of shares) during the
window (0,1) days around an earnings announcement by a principal customer or another firm in the same industry. The dependent variables in Panel B are
Purchase Indicator and Shares Purchased, which are constructed analogously to the variables in Panel A. Five earnings surprise measures are used as
independent variables: the earnings surprise for the customer and each firm in the customer's industry (Cust Industry Firm SUE), an indicator equal to one if
the earnings surprise is negative (Cust Industry Firm SUE Negative), an indicator equal to one if the earnings surprise is positive (Cust Industry Firm SUE
Positive), an indicator variable equal to one if the earnings surprise is less than  0.3% of the stock price (Cust Industry Firm SUE o  0.3%), and an indicator
variable equal to one if the earnings surprise is greater than 0.3% of the stock price (Cust Industry Firm SUE40.3%). Customer is an indicator equal to one if
the earnings surprise is for a customer. Non-Customer is an indicator equal to one if the earnings surprise is for a customer peer. Control variables include
the past 30-day cumulative abnormal supplier return (Past Ret), the equal-weighted market return on the earnings announcement day (Market), the log of
market capitalization for the prior year [Log(Size)], and the log of the book-to-market ratio for the prior year [Log(B/M)]. Standard errors are in parentheses,
and significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level are indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

extended when earnings surprises are announced on
Fridays.18 These regressions demonstrate a stronger rela-
tion between the customer earnings surprises announced
on Fridays and supplier insiders' stock trades. The probit
regressions predicting supplier insider stock sales in
Columns 1 and 2 of Panel A estimate marginal increases
in the probability of a stock sale of 213% and 425% when a
customer announces earnings shortfalls and large earnings
shortfalls, respectively, on Fridays.19 Similar unreported
Tobit regressions estimate marginal increases in the num-
ber of shares sold by supplier insiders of 11,740 and 19,190
when customers announce earnings shortfalls and large
shortfalls on Fridays, respectively, conditional on there
being a sale. The results are also more pronounced for
supplier insider purchases, reported in Panel B. Here, the
probit regressions indicate marginal increases in the odds
of a supplier insider purchase of 130% or 328% for positive
earnings surprises and large positive earnings surprises,
respectively.20 Here, Tobit regressions estimate marginal
increases in the number of shares purchased of 1,962 and
3,837, respectively.

The results thus far provide evidence that supplier
insider trading is a function of the information content
in customers' public announcements. We conclude our
analysis with a number of robustness tests designed to
evaluate, as best as possible, whether trading in this

18 A recent working paper by Michaely, Rubin, and Vedrashko (2013)
argues that
the extended PEAD associated with Friday earnings
announcements is not due to investor inattention at the end of the week,
but rather the characteristics of firms that make Friday announcements
(small market cap, low analyst following, low institutional shareholdings)
or the fact that these announcements are more likely to be made after
markets close for the day, or both. Regardless of the factors driving the
extended PEAD under these circumstances, our test should still be valid
to the extent all of these factors are associated with investor inattention.
19 The odds of a stock sale are higher by 3.26% and 6.50%, respec-
tively, following missed earnings and large misses, compared with the
unconditional odds of a sale of 1.53%.

20 The odds of a stock purchase are higher by 0.658% and 1.66%,
respectively, for positive earnings surprises and large surprises, compared
with the unconditional odds of a purchase of 0.506%.

context is genuinely motivated by information learned
from public sources. The first issue addressed is whether
we can be confident that supplier insiders' trades around
the time of their customers' earnings announcements
follow the public release of the information. Over the time
period studied we do not have time-stamp data capturing
when earnings were released, so we cannot be certain that
trading on the day of the release (day 0) follows the
announcement. In Columns 3 and 4 of Table 8 we provide
regressions that analyze trading in the two-day window
(1,2)
the earnings
release. For both sales (Panel A) and purchases (Panel B),
the results show that the fundamental relation between
supplier insider trading and customer earnings surprises
remains intact when we focus on this window that follows
the earnings release. Again, unreported Tobit regressions
that analyze the number of shares traded give consistent
results.

immediately following the day of

The next alternative we consider is whether supplier
insiders are privy to the information content of their
customers' earnings releases ahead of time and actively
trade on this information while it is still expected to be
private. Principal customers could convey information to
their suppliers in the normal course of business (through
sales orders, cancellations, or indications of commit-
ments), or they could intentionally tip suppliers as to the
content of upcoming news releases. In Columns 5 and 6 of
each panel we analyze trading in the two-day period
immediately preceding customer earnings releases. The
results are interesting. We find only weak evidence that
supplier insiders sell stock during this period when the
pending customer announcement predicts they should.
But we find that the relation between supplier insider
purchases and the content of the pending release is similar
to what was found following the release. Furthermore, for
the most part, the insiders that trade in the expected
direction ahead of customer earnings releases are not the
same ones who trade following the announcements. We
find that only 11% of
in the week
following negative customer earnings surprises also sell

insiders who sell

Table 8
Robustness tests of supplier insider trading around customer earnings announcements.

This table presents robustness tests using probit regressions predicting insider trading at economically linked supplier firms as a function of their
customers' earnings announcements. The regressions in Panel A (Panel B) predict insider sales (purchases). In Columns 1 and 2 of Panel A, Sale Indicator is
equal to one if there is at least one supplier insider sale during the window (0,1) days around an earnings announcement by a principal customer or other
firm in the same industry Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 4. In Columns 3 and 4 of Panel A, Sale Indicator is equal to one if there is at least one
supplier insider sale during the window (1,2) days immediately following the day a principal customers or another firm in the same industry announced
earnings. In Columns 5 and 6 of Panel A, Sale Indicator is equal to one if there is at least one supplier insider sale during the window ( 2, 1) days
preceding an earnings announcement by a principal customer or another firm in the same industry. Lastly, in Columns 7 and 8 of Panel A, Sale Indicator is
equal to one if there is at least one supplier insider sale during the window (0,1) days around an earnings announcement by a principal customer. The
explanatory variables of interest in Panel B are the insider purchase analog to those in Panel A. The observations in Columns 1 and 2 are limited to earnings
announcements that occur on Fridays. The observations in Columns 7 and 8 of Panel A (Panel B) are limited to those where the insider made at least one
sale (purchase) within the 20 trading days leading up to the earnings announcement. See Table 7 for earnings surprise measures and control variable
definitions. Standard errors are in parentheses, and significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level are indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

in the two days leading up to the announcement and only
6% of insiders who purchase following a positive surprise
also purchased before the announcement. At the firm
level,
in only 15% of cases in which an insider sold
following a negative customer earnings surprise did
another insider at that firm sell in the days before the
announcement. The similar measure for purchases is
just 10%.

We offer a couple of comments on these findings. First,
it is reasonable to expect customers to be more careful not
to convey negative news before they release it to the
public, either due to similar concerns over legal liability or
because of a desire to hide negative information but
convey positive information quickly.21 From this perspec-
tive, selling by supplier insiders following the poor earn-
ings releases looks more like attentive trading on newly
public information, whereas purchasing before the earn-
ings releases seems more likely to reflect a willingness to
buy stock on private information, if available. The second
alternative is that supplier insiders have similar access to
positive and negative information from their customers
before it is released, but they refrain from selling,
in
particular, until bad news is released to the public. If the
informed insiders wait to trade, then this is analogous to
an insider trading following their own public announce-
ments (that they would have had prior knowledge of),
with the additional benefit that they are confident they
can profit because the market will be slow to respond to
the information. Overall, this piece of our analysis confirms
the existence of a set of supplier insiders who trade
attentively on public information released by their custo-
mers, while others could exploit
their informational
advantage prior to the announcements, especially when
the news is good.

The final analysis that we offer helps determine
whether supplier insiders genuinely learn from their
customers' public disclosures. To get at this question, we
evaluate the trading decisions of supplier insiders around
customer earnings announcements, conditioned on the
fact that they are already trading in the predicted direction
during the 20 trading days prior to the release. Because
they are already trading, it is likely that they either already
know the content of their customer's announcement and

21 See Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal (2005), Anilowski, Feng, and
Skinner (2006), and Kothari, Shu, and Wysocki (2009) for evidence that
managers prefer to release or leak good news quickly but withhold bad
news from the market as long as possible. Similar reasoning could drive
firms' communications with their key business partners.

are taking advantage of this before it was made public, are
already trading on other private signals, or are trading for
unrelated reasons in the lead-up period. The results are
reported in Columns 7 and 8 of the panels. For the case of
stock sales we continue to find some evidence that these
insiders' trading behavior immediately following their
customers' announcements is related to the information
content of the customers' earnings, even in this limited
sample. This would not be expected if they are trading on
this particular information ahead of time. Also, given that
they are already trading, it does not appear that they are
waiting for a public news release to camouflage trading
motivated by other, unrelated, private information. It is
therefore reasonable to expect that the earnings releases,
in fact, convey new information to these insiders, motivat-
ing their post-announcement stock sales. The exception to
this interpretation would be if these insiders begin a
sequence of trading on the information about their custo-
mer while it is still private that extends into the post-
announcement period.

4. Conclusion

A body of

literature demonstrates that corporate
insiders' trades predict abnormal returns. Because insiders
are privy to information about their firms before it is
disclosed to the public, it is natural to suspect that these
returns reflect trading decisions based on private informa-
tion. However, there are also significant costs to trading on
private information as doing so is in violation of securities
laws and invites scrutiny from regulators and outside
investors. Another body of literature shows that investors
are limited in their ability to understand the impact of
relevant public information on stock prices. This can result
in opportunities for particularly attentive investors to
trade profitably on public information. Corporate insiders
likely represent such a group of investors.

We analyze corporate insider trading in a setting that
allows us to possibly distinguish between illegal trading on
private information and attentive trading on public infor-
mation. The setting is trading at firms that sell a large
fraction of their products to principal customers. We find
that insiders at these firms execute more profitable stock
sales than those at other firms, and we provide evidence
that at times they generate these enhanced profits by
trading on public information. They sell more stock when
public information about their principal customers pre-
dicts that their trades will be profitable and their custo-
mers' past returns explain the abnormal returns following

100

their sales. We do not find the same contrasting patterns
for insider purchases, suggesting that insiders are more
likely to refrain from trading on private information when
the litigation risk associated with being detected is high,
which is the case with insider sales more so than with
purchases.

More work would have to be done to estimates the
actual
levels of attentive insider stock selling. Other
researchers have uncovered complimentary patterns of
trading and stock return predictability that could point
toward the extent of this behavior. For example, Ali, Wei,
and Zhou (2011) show that insiders trade in the opposite
direction of high volume price-moving trading by mutual
funds, which could represent a similar form of insider
trading motivated by mispricing relative to public infor-
mation.
Jenter (2005) shows that insiders tend to be
contrarian, which could indicate they trade when beha-
vioral biases in other investors cause their stock price to
move away from its fundamental value. In terms of market
inefficiencies that insiders could take advantage of, Lo and
MacKinlay (1990) show that small stocks tend to be less
efficiently priced than large stocks,
leading to return
predictability across the two groups. Further, Sadka
(2006) argues that stock return momentum and PEAD
returns are associated with increased insider trading. The
perspective supported by this paper is also related to the
one proposed by papers showing a relation between
insiders'
trading profits and information asymmetry
(Aboody and Lev, 2000; Frankel and Li, 2004; Huddart
and Ke, 2007). That body of work argues that insiders
make greater profits on private information when firms
are more opaque and, therefore, more private information
is available on which to trade. However, the results we
present could call for a reinterpretation of those results if
proxies for information asymmetry are also related to the
time it takes the market to digest public information. Also,
given their knowledge and experience with their own
firms, insiders likely are attuned to a variety of other
forms of public information that bear on their firms' values
but to which the market does not quickly adjust.

We caution, though, against overgeneralization of our
results. For one, we do not find evidence of attentive
insider stock purchasing on public information. In addi-
tion, our results for stock sales could characterize insider
trading only in the specific situation in which firms
maintain strong economic links to other public companies,
and they could characterize a subset of the trades by
insiders only at these firms. Our evidence should be
balanced against prior studies that provide evidence of
trading on private information in certain settings. Exam-
ples include insider trading during private merger nego-
tiations
(Heitzman and Klasa, 2013) or before the
revelation of accounting fraud (Agrawal and Cooper,
2014).
Jagolinzer (2009) also shows that insiders earn
significantly higher profits when they are afforded safe
harbors from legal liability, such as when their trades
follow pre-determined plans as allowed under SEC Rule
10b5-1. His results could have captured a subset of illegal
trading on private information under special circum-
stances when negative repercussions could be avoided.
But, one should also be careful not to overgeneralize these

results either. In the case of private merger negotiations,
the clear prediction is that target insiders should purchase
undervalued shares, so this activity is unlikely to speak to
the prevalence of illegal insider selling. And illegal selling
during accounting fraud could reflect the character of a
limited group of unethical executives, such that general-
ization to other insiders could be inappropriate.

Finally, we submit that our analysis could be useful for
other researchers by laying the groundwork for identifying
insiders who are more attentive to market developments
that will impact their firms in the future. This information
could be useful as a measure of executive or director quality
or effort. Such a measure could be a valuable indicator of
insiders' ability to adapt to future business conditions, thus
impacting future firm values, security returns, and economic
growth, while minimizing wasteful overinvestment.
