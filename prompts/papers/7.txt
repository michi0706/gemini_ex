Abstract

We investigate the success of legislation aimed at increasing competition at highly con-
centrated major US airports, mainly by forcing these airports to increase the availability of
scarce airport facilities to new entrants. We use a multi-dimensional regression-discontinuity
approach to exploit a sharp discontinuity in the law’s implementation and identify its ef-
fects. We ﬁnd a statistically and economically signiﬁcant decrease in fares resulting from
an airport’s coverage, 13.4% (20.2%) in markets with one (both) endpoint(s) covered. Ap-
proximately half of the decline in fares is driven by the entry of low-cost carriers. With the
exception of a small eﬀect on on-time performance, we ﬁnd little evidence that the fare de-
clines were accompanied by a diminished quality of service. The magnitude of price declines
relative to delay increases, along with the accompanying increases in passenger volumes,
suggest the legislation was welfare improving. The results also suggest operating barriers to
entry have been an important impediment to new low-cost competition.

One of the most enduring features of the post-deregulation U.S. airline industry has been the

hub premium, the premium over average fares paid by passengers traveling to and from airports

dominated by a single large “hub”carrier. Though this phenomenon has been widely documented

(e.g. Borenstein (1989)), its causes and consequences are still in question. To the extent that

higher fares result from the exercise of market power, they are detrimental to consumer welfare

and eﬃciency. On the other hand, there is substantial evidence that consumers value the large

route network and high frequencies that dominant carriers often provide (e.g. Berry (1990)). To

the extent that high prices derive from these quality factors, they beneﬁt consumers. Airport

facilities, a necessary input for the provision of air service, are increasingly scarce due in large part

to government regulation handicapping airports’ ability to ﬁnance facilities expansion in response

to increasing demand. As a consequence of this increased scarcity, airport-level concentration

and market power go hand in hand with the airline scope and scale that consumers value and

drive down costs. Given this, the relative contribution, and the optimality of the balance, of

these factors is an empirical question.

In 2000, the U.S. Congress enacted the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform

Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21). A primary directive of the bill was to require airports,

above a given level of concentration, to take concrete steps to ensure that new entrants had

ample access to airport facilities.1Airport compliance requires ﬁling a Competition Plan with

the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), detailing the steps taken. The FAA then reviews

the plan and releases federal funding contingent on a satisfactory plan.

In this paper we empirically evaluate the impact of AIR-21 on prices, passenger volumes,

quality, and market structure to investigate the importance of access to airport facilities as

barriers to entry in the airline industry. The nature of the implementation of AIR-21 is useful

for solving identiﬁcation problems common in industrial organization studies of competition and

market structure and present in our context. The problem is that elements of market structure

(e.g. concentration, low-cost carrier presence, etc.) are determined simultaneously with the

level of competition and usually depend on common, market-speciﬁc unobserved factors (e.g.

demand elasticities or network economies associated with airport geography). We use the design

of AIR-21 to formulate a diﬀerences in diﬀerences (diﬀ-in-diﬀ) and regression discontinuity (RD)

1The law applied to airports in which the top 2 airlines accounted for over 50% of total enplanements at the

airport.

We ﬁrst argue the AIR-21 mandates were enforced and eﬀectively reduced barriers to entry at

covered airports. This generates rarely available variation, with a plausibly known direction, over

time in barriers to entry within markets. This allows us to control for time-invariant, market-

speciﬁc factors using standard panel techniques. Second, having contemporaneous treatment and

control groups allows us to use diﬀ-in-diﬀ to address aggregate and market-speciﬁc variation in

these factors over time.

There are still likely to be selection problems associated with using the full sample for iden-

tiﬁcation. Berry and Jia (2010), observing lower fares and diminished carrier proﬁt margins

between the end of the 1990’s and the middle 2000’s, estimate discrete choice demand systems

separately for 1997 and 2005 and conclude that increased passenger price sensitivity, combined

with increased penetration of low-cost carriers, was responsible for the change. Since airport

concentration itself is likely highly correlated with product quality, the time-varying relative

valuations of quality found by Berry and Jia (2010) likely interact with our determinant of

treatment. This causes diﬀering average trends for treated and untreated markets, invalidating

the simple diﬀ-in-diﬀ approach. We solve this and any similar such problems by arguing that,

while there is likely a selection problem associated with highly concentrated airports, there is

no such problem locally around the 50% two-carrier concentration level speciﬁed by AIR-21.

This allows us to develop a RD estimator for the local average treatment eﬀects associated with

AIR-21. Essentially, we assume the distribution of unobservables for a randomly selected market

just below the cutoﬀ is identical to a randomly selected market just above the cutoﬀ.

The design of AIR-21 also helps us dismiss concerns about manipulation of the predictors of

coverage. Airport coverage is determined by traﬃc data from two years prior to coverage, making

coverage dependent on the past actions of the carriers which are not subject to manipulation.

Given the complexity of airline pricing decisions, it also seems unlikely that carriers would adjust

fare-setting behavior to manipulate enplanements at the airport level. Nevertheless, we design

an informal test of manipulation. The test is based on the observation that, for a given two-ﬁrm

airport concentration level, airports with higher one-ﬁrm concentration levels would be more

likely to see manipulation, since a single carrier has more control over the coverage variable.

This test shows no evidence of manipulation.

Ultimately, we implement two RD estimators. The ﬁrst takes the boundary dummy approach

of Black (1999), using observations from progressively smaller windows around the treatment

3

cutoﬀs. The second is a novel, true RD estimator. Since airline markets necessarily involve

both an origin and a destination airport, we naturally have to consider two predictor variables

and four treatment/control groups when deﬁning our treatment eﬀects; both the origin and

destination are treated, just the origin is treated, just the destination is treated, and neither

is treated. Our approach is essentially to estimate the surface for each of these “quadrants”

and look for breaks at the boundaries of those quadrants. Our implementation of the two

dimensional RD estimator is novel in that it allows for substantial heterogeneity by permitting

the average treatment eﬀect of one endpoint to vary, essentially, according to the identity of the

other endpoint airport.

Our relatively clean identiﬁcation strategy represents a contribution to the extant literature

on airline market structure and the importance of barriers to entry more generally. A typical

structural study of entry and market structure in concentrated industries (e.g. Bresnahan and

Reiss (1991), Berry (1992), Mazzeo (2002), Seim (2006), Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)) looks

at ﬁrm choices and uses a revealed preference approach to infer entry barriers. This approach

requires the economist to rely on many restrictions of the empirical model derived from economic

theory.

In the end, barriers to entry are often measured as the “residual”that justiﬁes the cross

market heterogeneity in market structures. Our approach, on the other hand, uses a known

source of exogenous variation in entry barriers to investigate their eﬀects on market outcomes

and requires little necessary theoretical structure. The minimal structural requirements are

useful for an industry as complex as the airline industry, where it is diﬃcult to construct a

model that is simultaneously rich enough to be quantitatively relevant and tractable enough to

be amenable to analysis. Also, our focus on outcomes makes our results directly relevant for

policy.

To preview results, we ﬁnd AIR-21 had substantial, and evidently positive, impact on com-

petition and fares in the airline industry. We ﬁnd that markets for which one of the endpoint

airports was subject to AIR-21 have seen price declines of 13% on average. Markets for which

both endpoints were subject to the mandates have seen price declines of around 20% on average.

These price declines were associated with no economically and statistically signiﬁcant changes

in measures of quality, with one exception. We ﬁnd that the on-time performance of carriers at

covered airports decreased. This is not particularly surprising, as we identify increased low-cost

carrier penetration as a driving force behind the declines in fares, reinforcing the ﬁndings of

Mayer and Sinai (2003) that higher airport concentration leads to better on-time performance

4

as large carriers, presumably, internalize more of the congestion costs. We also ﬁnd that the

magnitude of the decline in fares is larger for carriers with a large presence at an airport than for

other carriers. This suggests that AIR-21 was successful at reducing the hub premia identiﬁed

by Borenstein (1989). While the delay results suggest some quality degredation on some dimen-

sions, the magnitudes of the price declines and accompanying increases in passenger volumes

indicate the legislation was, overall, welfare enhancing.

The implications of our ﬁndings are not limited to retrospective policy evaluation. The

competition provisions of AIR-21 address the allocation of a given stock of airport facilities. A

more natural policy prescription might be to encourage the expansion of this stock. However,

since 2001 passenger facility charges (PFCs), the per boarding passenger tax levied by the airport

and a primary source of funding for airport investment projects for large airports and the primary

backing for the external ﬁnance of such projects, have been federally capped at $4.50, in spite

of protest from airport authorities.

In a letter to President Obama dated August 18, 2011,

Greg Pricipatio, president of the trade association Airports Council International-North America

(ACI-NA), urged the president to lift the cap as part of his jobs creation plan, saying “the $2

billion [PFC] raises a year is already committed to paying for recently completed projects or

those currently underway.” Resistance to PFC increases has come from large carriers wishing to

avoid their share of the tax burden and simultaneously prevent expansion of their home airports

and the accompanying increase in competition. The inﬂuence of these carriers is not surprising

given their importance not only to the airport where they operate large hubs, but also to the

communities, where they employ thousands of workers and provide a substantial tax base. While

our results do not speak directly to the eﬀect of airport expansion, they suggest this resistance

may come at the cost of diminished competition and sharply higher fares for air travelers in

those communities, and may warrant more careful study.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide some background

on the airline industry and discuss AIR-21 in detail. The data are described in Section 3 and

we document some basic patterns in the data over the policy period.

In Section 4, we discuss

our identiﬁcation strategy and the results of our analysis. Section 5 concludes and discusses

possible extensions of our research.

2 The Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Cen-

tury

The Government Accounting Oﬃce (GAO) and Transportation Research Board (TRB) released

a series of reports, see GAO (1989, 1990, 2001) and TRB (1999), bringing attention to the

limited amount of competition at many major US airports. These reports identiﬁed two types

of barriers to entry in the airline industry, operating and marketing, that can limit competition

and result in higher fares.

Marketing barriers include loyalty programs intended to tie consumers to an airline, frequent-

ﬂier programs, corporate incentive agreements, and travel agent commission overrides. A lack of

data has limited the study of these type of barriers, with Lederman (2007, 2008) and Goolsbee

and Syverson (2008) as notable exceptions. Lederman (2007, 2008) ﬁnds evidence that im-

provements in loyalty programs enhance demand and can explain a modest portion of the “hub

premium”. Goolsbee and Syverson (2008) show that national carriers respond to the “threat

of entry”by Southwest Airlines, a low-cost carrier, by lowering fares to strengthen consumer

loyalties prior to entry of Southwest.

Operating barriers include limited access to boarding gates, ticket counters, baggage handling

and storage facilities, and take-oﬀ and landing slots. Ciliberto and Williams (2010) were the

ﬁrst to directly link these operating barriers to the hub premium. Using unique data on

carrier-speciﬁc access to boarding gates, Ciliberto and Williams (2010) show that long-term

exclusive-use leasing agreements for boarding gates limit competition and are a major driver of

the hub premium.

In this paper, we employ a unique identiﬁcation strategy to examine the

success of AIR-21 in reducing these operating barriers and encouraging competition at major US

airports. In the sections to follow, we discuss the details of AIR-21’s design and implementation

2.1 Legislation and Airport Coverage

In response to governmental, public and academic concern with institutional barriers to entry

in the airline industry, President Clinton signed into law AIR-21 on April 5, 2000. Section 155

of AIR-21 begins:

The Congress makes the following ﬁndings:

(1) Major airports must be available on a reasonable basis to all air carriers

wishing to serve those airports.

6

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1775924

(2) 15 large hub airports today are each dominated by one air carrier, with each

such carrier controlling more than 50 percent of the traﬃc at the hub.

(3) The General Accounting Oﬃce has found that such levels of concentration

lead to higher air fares.

(4) The United States Government must take every step necessary to reduce those

levels of concentration.

(5) Consistent with air safety, spending at these airports must be directed at

providing opportunities for carriers wishing to serve such facilities on a commercially

viable basis.

Together (1), (4), and (5) demonstrate Congress’ clear intentions to reduce concentration by

encouraging additional entry at concentrated airports. To encourage airports’ cooperation in

opening up airports to “all air carriers wishing to serve those airports,” Congress made federal

sources of funding contingent on compliance:

“Beginning in ﬁscal year 2001, no passenger facility fee may be approved for a

covered airport under section 40117 and no grant may be made under this subchap-

ter for a covered airport unless the airport has submitted to the secretary a written

competition plan in accordance with this subsection.”

Passenger Facility Fees (commonly called PFCs) and Airport Improvement Program (AIP)

grants are the primary sources of federal funding for the industry and make up a signiﬁcant

portion of capital (including maintenance) budgets for major airports.2 PFCs were ﬁrst au-

thorized by Congress in 1990 and are tied to projects to preserve and enhance safety, reduce

noise pollution, and provide opportunities for enhanced competition between carriers. The

PFC ceiling, the maximum fee allowed by law, was increased from $1 to $4.50 between 1990 to

2001. This ceiling has not been increased since AIR-21 and is not indexed for inﬂation. AIP

grants are part of a federal program to help cover costs for approved capital projects aimed at

increasing safety and capacity as well as reducing environmental concerns.

A 2009 Airport Council International North America (ACI-NA) study found that over 40%

of airports’ capital funding is drawn from PFCs (21.7%) and AIP grants (22.2%).3

PFCs

2PFCs are charged by airlines at the time a ticket is purchased and are then transferred directly to the

appropriate airports.

alone have funded $50 billion worth of airport capital investments since 1990, including the

addition and maintenance of passenger boarding gates and runways necessary to accommodate

additional entry. An additional 30% of airports’ revenues come from bonds which are often

backed with future PFCs revenues. This substantial and stable revenue base allows airports

to signiﬁcantly lower the cost of borrowing and enjoy investment-grade ratings. While the

quasi-public status of many airports makes it diﬃcult to know their exact objectives, the strong

dependence of airports’ revenues on the federal government’s control over the right to charge

PFCs and distribute AIP grant funding seems to imply strong incentives for compliance. All

airports covered by AIR-21 are forced to ﬁle a competition plan with the FAA and the DOT,

which in turn must certify the plan as acceptable for funding to be released. 4

Congress also made it clear that competition “plans”were to be implemented:

“The Secretary shall review any plan submitted...to ensure that it meets the re-

quirements of this section, and shall review its implementation from time-to-time

to ensure that each covered airport successfully implements its plan.....The Secre-

tary shall ensure that gates and other facilities are made available at costs that are

fair and reasonable to air carriers at covered airports...where a ”majority-in-interest

clause” of a contract or other agreement or arrangement inhibits the ability of the

local airport authority to provide or build new gates or other facilities.”

In conversations with those at the FAA assigned to approve and ensure implementation of

the competition plans, we learned that approval was not a certainty for any plan.

In many

cases, the plans were signiﬁcantly revised after discussions between the FAA, DOT, and airport

authorities to ensure the plans meet the goals of the legislation. After ﬁling the initial compe-

tition plan, airports were required to complete two updates (approximately 18 months apart)

that demonstrate signiﬁcant progress towards implementing the competition plan. There are

no mandatory steps after the second update for covered airports, unless the airport denies a

carrier access to airport facilities or signiﬁcantly amends an existing leasing agreement or enacts

a new master-leasing agreement.

Section 155 continues:

4The 44 airports required by AIR-21 to ﬁle a competition plan include: ABQ,ANC, ATL, AUS, BNA, BUR,
BWI, CLE, CLT, CVG, DAL, DCA, DEN, DFW, DTW, EWR,HOU, IAD, IAH, JAX, LAS, MDW, MEM, MIA,
MKE, MSP, OAK, OGG, ONT, ORD, PBI,PHL, PHX, PIT, PVD, RNO, SAT, SDF, SFO, SJC, SJU, SLC,
SMF, and STL. The majority (43) of the airports were immediately “covered”by the retroactive nature of the
legislation. The only airport to be covered later was LAS in 2005.

8

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1775924

“A competition plan under this subsection shall include information on the avail-

ability of airport gates and related facilities, leasing and sub-leasing arrangements,

gate-use requirements, patterns of air service, gate-assignment policy, ﬁnancial con-

straints, airport controls over air- and ground-side capacity, whether the airport in-

tends to build or acquire gates that would be used as common facilities, and airfare

levels (as compiled by the Department of Transportation) compared to other large

airports.”

The typical competition plan ranges in length from 75 to 100 pages and contains a vast amount

of information about the airport’s operations. Ciliberto and Williams (2010) use this information

to demonstrate that Congress’ focus on equal access to sunk airport facilities is not completely

misguided. Using cross-sectional variation in gate allocations and leasing terms, Ciliberto and

Williams (2010) can explain an economically signiﬁcant fraction of the hub premium, with this

fraction being larger at congested airports.

In this paper, we focus on measuring any reduction

in fares and the hub premium resulting from coverage of an airport by AIR-21.

To identify the impact of AIR-21 on the hub premium, and fares more generally, we exploit

the sharp discontinuity in the relationship between coverage and concentration:

“.....’covered airport’ means a commercial service airport....that has more than

.25 percent of the total number of passenger boardings each year at all such air-

ports.....at which one or two air carriers control more than 50 percent of the passen-

ger boardings.”

These concentration thresholds create treatment and control groups, airports “very near”either

side of the discontinuity, which can be used to measure the impact of the legislation on compe-

tition.5 An airport is covered by the legislation if it qualiﬁes in both the size and concentration

dimensions.6

In Section 4, we discuss how we exploit this feature of the legislation using a

regression discontinuity approach to measure a (local) treatment eﬀect, or impact from coverage

at the concentration cutoﬀ. Tables 1 and 2 show the two-ﬁrm enplanement concentration and

the fraction of total domestic enplanement at covered and non-covered airports, respectively.

5As with any analysis examining treatment eﬀects, the treatment must be exogenously applied. In the context
of our study, endogeneity of treatment might arise if airports can lower concentration of enplanements and/or
total enplanements to avoid being covered by the legislation.
In Section 4.2.3, we show that there is little or no
support for the claim that enplanements were strategically manipulated by carriers to avoid coverage.

6The discontinuity along the size dimension also presents an opportunity to identify an eﬀect from coverage,

but the small number of airports near this cutoﬀ limits our ability to exploit this feature of the law.

While concentration and size are positively correlated, it is far from a perfect relationship. For

example, Newark (EWR) is covered while New York (JFK) is not. Similarly, San Francisco

(SFO) is covered while Los Angeles (LAX) is not.

2.2

Implementation of Competition Plans

Most of the competition plans and subsequent updates are available on each airport’s website.

The details of each competition plan are too vast to review here. However, a 2006 FAA report

highlights speciﬁc actions taken by airports in a variety of areas to increase competition.7

In terms of improving availability of gates and related facilities, airport responses included

asserting control over under-utilized gates, designating Competition Access committees, adopt-

ing more entry-friendly leasing terms, removing speciﬁc access protections for signatory carriers,

and streamlining a forced accommodation process. Speciﬁc actions included Hartsﬁeld-Jackson

Atlanta International Airport (ATL) invoking recapture authority to convert a leased gate to

common use, Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) negotiating conver-

sion of exclusively leased gates to common and preferentially leased gates, and San Francisco

International Airport (SFO) invoking a forced accommodation clause to ensure that temporary

needs of new entrant airlines were met.

In terms of subleasing agreements, covered airports

also began to assert more control and oversight over sublease fees, terms, and conditions, impose

sublease caps on administrative fees, review and/or pre-approve subleases, and notify carriers

of gates available for subleases.

Improving access to passenger boarding gates was clearly the focus of a large proportion of

each competition plan. However, covered airports put forth eﬀort in a variety of other ways to

increase competition. For example, both Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) and

San Antonio International Airport (SAT) implemented a marketing plan to attract additional

low-fare carrier service. To make more eﬃcient use of existing common-use facilities, ATL now

enforces maximum turnaround times. Oakland International Airport (OAK) installed common

use ticketing equipment (CUTE) at ticket counters and gates so that all airlines operating there

will use identical facilities, providing maximum ﬂexibility to airport administrators. CLT re-

duced landing fees for non-signatory and new entrant carriers to the same level as signatory

airlines (i.e. those obligated to repay debt issued by the airport). Nearly all covered airports

implemented measures to record gate utilization, impose minimum-use standards, and notify

airlines of gate availability to make more eﬃcient use of existing gates. Many airports also

amended majority-in-interest (MII) agreements to exempt capital projects necessary for compe-

tition from MII votes.8

3 Data

3.1 Sources

The majority of our data for this study is taken from the Data Bank 1B (DB1B) of the U.S.

Department of Transportation’s Origin and Destination Survey for the years 1993 through 2008.

The DB1B data are a 10 percent random sample of all domestic itineraries. The unit of

observation is the passenger level. The data contain information on the ticketing and operating

carrier, details of any connections made by the passenger, and the fare paid for the itinerary

used by the passenger. Following Evans and Kessides (1994), we consider round-trip tickets

to be two equally priced one-way tickets and drop both inter-line and open-jaw tickets. Due

to key punch errors or redemption of frequent-ﬂier miles, there are some unusually large and

small ticket prices in the DB1B data. For this reason, we drop any fares, measured in 2008

dollars, greater than $2500 and less than $25.9

In addition, we drop itineraries with more than

6 coupons (4 connections) for round-trip itineraries and 3 coupons (2 connections) for one-way

itineraries. Following Borenstein and Rose (1994), we deﬁne a market as directional travel

between a unique airport-pair.

We supplement the DB1B data with information on the frequency and severity of delays from

the DOT’s Airline On-Time Performance database.

We also collected the enplanement data used by the FAA to determine coverage by AIR-21.

There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between these data and the enplanement data that are publicly

available through the DOT’s T100 database. These diﬀerences arise because the T100 data do

not include on-demand (e.g. charter ﬂights) and in-transit (e.g. plane stops to refuel but does

not deplane) passengers who are a signiﬁcant source of enplanements at many airports. The

diﬀerences are signiﬁcant enough that the determination of coverage for a handful of airports

would change depending on the source of enplanement data.

over airport expansions.

9We also drop all itineraries for which the DOT questions the credibility of the reported fare, as indicated by

the tktdollarcred variable.

11

Our ﬁnal source of data is a survey conducted jointly with the ACI-NA.10 The survey,

completed by 47% of all medium and large hubs, those enplaning more than 0.25% of all en-

planements at primary airports in the US, focused on gathering information on carrier-airport

speciﬁc leasing agreements for boarding gates. For each airport, we observe the total number

of gates, number of gates leased by each carrier on an exclusive and preferential basis, and the

number of gates reserved for common-use by the airport authority. The details regarding the

construction of the data set can be found in the appendix.

3.2 Descriptive Statistics

Tables 1 and 2 summarize the FAA and survey data for medium and large hubs. Column 1 in

Tables 1 and 2 lists the covered and non-covered airports, respectively. The second column of

Table 1 lists the year in which each airport was ﬁrst covered by the legislation. Due to the

lag in data collection, coverage in any particular year is determined by enplanement data from

two years earlier. For example, the set of airports ﬁrst covered by the legislation in 2000 was

determined using enplanement data from 1998. This is important for our purposes, since it

would be very unlikely that an airline could perfectly foresee the details of the legislation two

years in advance and manipulate enplanements to avoid coverage of a particular airport. Of

covered airports, LAS was the only airport not covered retroactively by the legislation.

In

Section 4.2.3, we test whether the lack of a signiﬁcant number of airports ﬁrst covered in later

years is due to potential manipulation of enplanements by carriers.

The next 3 Columns of both Table 1 and 2 report the mean fraction of all US enplanements

performed at the airport, the mean and max share of the top-2 carriers from 1998 to 2006

(determines coverage from 2000 to 2008). The maximum of the top-2 carriers’ shares during this

period serves as the predictor of coverage by the legislation since once an airport’s concentration

exceeds this threshold it is required to ﬁle and execute a competition plan. Thus, for each

airport in Table 1 (2) this variable is greater (less) than .5.

It is also important to note that

coverage is not a proxy for the size of the airport. Examining the means at the bottom of

Tables 1 and 2 for the fraction of all US enplanements, we see little diﬀerence in size between

covered and non-covered airports. This is important, as it alleviates some concerns over the

homogeneity of the treatment and control groups in our analysis.

The ﬁnal columns of Tables 1 and 2 report the fraction of gates reserved by the airport

authority for common-use, fraction leased on a preferential or exclusive basis by legacy carriers,

and fraction leased on a preferential or exclusive basis by low-cost carriers.11 Examining the

respective means in 2001 and 2008 of these variables at the bottom of Tables 1 and 2, we see

little evidence that gates moved diﬀerentially at covered and non-covered airports. However,

the large amount of missing data makes drawing any strong conclusions diﬃcult. The lack of

a signiﬁcant movement in the allocation of gates for most airports from 2001 to 2008 suggests

that the FAA and DOT largely followed the recommendations put forth by GAO (2001). GAO

(2001) cautioned that AIR-21 should not be used as a means to force the divestiture of assets

(e.g. boarding gates) from dominant carriers at an airport for two reasons. First, the reallocation

of assets among competing carriers might have little to no beneﬁt if the gates were not allocated

to a low-cost competitor; see Brueckner et al. (2011) and Ciliberto and Tamer (2009) for strong

support for this statement. Second, service in smaller markets would likely be the ﬁrst aﬀected

by divestiture of a dominant carrier’s assets. This is intuitive: we expect a ﬁrm to eliminate or

cut service in the least proﬁtable markets, and the presence of any ﬁxed costs associated with

serving a market and signiﬁcant economies of density in the industry (see Brueckner and Spiller

(1994)) ensure a strong correlation between proﬁtability and size.

The lack of a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the reallocation of gates among carriers at covered and

non-covered airports foreshadows our ﬁnding that coverage by AIR-21 has little eﬀect on the

network of destinations oﬀered out of an airport.

It also suggests that if we are to ﬁnd a signif-

icant eﬀect from coverage by AIR-21 on other dimensions of service, it is due to more eﬃcient

use of existing assets (the focus of most competition plans) rather than to a redistribution of

assets among carriers.

Table 3 summarizes the variables we construct from the DB1B data and other sources, before

and after AIR-21, separately for the set of covered and non-covered airports. Column 3 gives

the means of each variable, for covered and non-covered airports, over the entire sample period.

To motivate our approach in Section 4 and emphasize the importance of controlling for trends in

the data prior to coverage by AIR-21, we summarize the ﬁrst diﬀerence for each variable. More

precisely, for each variable, the diﬀerence before AIR-21 is calculated as the level in the ﬁrst

quarter of 1999 minus the level in the ﬁrst quarter of 1993, while the diﬀerence after AIR-21 is

calculated as the level in the ﬁrst quarter of 2008 minus the level in the ﬁrst quarter of 2002.12

Using the DB1B data, we classify a carrier’s service in each market into one of two types,

nonstop or connecting. For each type of service in a market, Avg.F are is calculated as the

average fare across passengers choosing a type of service. Avg.M kt.F are, 20thP ct.M kt.F are,

50thP ct.M kt.F are, 80thP ct.M kt.F are are constructed similarly for diﬀerent quantiles of the fare

distribution in the market as a whole, aggregating across carriers and types of service. Table 3

shows a signiﬁcant downward trend in fares in both covered and non-covered markets. However,

prior to AIR-21 fares were falling less rapidly at covered airports, while after AIR-21, fares fell

more rapidly at covered airports. These diﬀerential trends are strongest in the upper quantiles

of the fare distribution.

In Section 4, we attempt to identify a causal relationship between

coverage by AIR-21 and these diﬀerential trends in fares, while controlling for a variety of time-

varying covariates. N onstop is an indicator for whether or not a carrier’s service is nonstop.

Distance.T raveled is the average number of miles traveled by passengers purchasing a type of

service from a carrier in a particular market. For nonstop service, Distance.T raveled is equal to

the direct distance between the market endpoints. For connecting service, Distance.T raveled

is strictly greater than the direct distance.

At the airport-carrier level, we construct two variables from the DB1B. F raction.Routes is

the proportion of all the destinations oﬀered out of an originating airport for which a carrier

oﬀers either nonstop or connecting service. For example, suppose that a total of 200 diﬀerent

markets are served out of Atlanta (ATL) by all carriers. Further, suppose Delta and American

serve 180 and 100 markets out of ATL, respectively.

In this example, F raction.Routes is equal

to 0.9 and 0.5 for Delta and American, respectively. Thus, the numerator of F raction.Routes

is the total number of markets served by a carrier out of an airport, N umber.Routes, while

the denominator is the total number of routes served by any carrier out of the airport. This

variable is intended to measure the relative attractiveness of carriers’ networks.

Our measure of the hub premium, similar to the relative price measures used in Borenstein

(1989), in a given market is calculated as the diﬀerence between the fares charged by the carriers

with the largest share of enplanements at the origin and destination airports and the average of

fares charged by all other carriers. For example, in the ATL (Atlanta Hartsﬁeld) to CLE (Cleve-

12Our results are nearly identical if 1993 to 2000 and 2001 to 2008 are used to construct the diﬀerences. Yet
by not using 2000 and 2001, we reduce the possibility of our results being biased from the disruptions to the
industry from the events of 9/11, anticipation by airports regarding the components of the law, or delays in its
implementation.

land Hopkins) market, Delta and Continental are regarded as the dominant carriers (those with

the largest share of enplanements), and Avg.Dominant.P remium is calculated as the diﬀerence

between the average fare charged by Delta and Continental and the average fare charged by all

other carriers. This variable is summarized in Table 3 and suggests that coverage is associated

with a moderate decline in the premium charged by dominant carriers. To measure the availabil-

ity of nonstop service, an important dimension to service quality, we calculate P ct.N onstop as

the percentage of passengers traveling nonstop in a market. We also construct two measures of

competition in a market, Lcc.P enetration and N umber.F irms. Lcc.P enetration, summarized

in Table 3, is an indicator for whether a low-cost carrier is present in the market. As has been

well documented, low-cost carrier penetration has been steadily increasing over the previous

decade and typically results in intense price competition.

In Section 4, and as the descriptives

suggest, we show that in markets where one or both endpoint airports are covered by AIR-21,

the low-cost penetration rate is signiﬁcantly higher as a result of coverage. N umber.F irms is

the total number of ﬁrms serving the market and is a commonly used measure of competition

in the Industrial Organization literature; see Berry (1992) and Ciliberto and Tamer (2009).

We calculate P (Delay (cid:21) 15), using the Airline On-Time Performance data, as the proportion

those variables we construct from the DOT sources, we also collected data on both population

and per-capita income for each MSA from the Bureau of Economic Analysis to serve as controls

throughout our analysis.

4 Empirical Analysis

Our ﬁnal sample includes data from all airports classiﬁed as a medium or large hub by the FAA

(enplaning at least 0.25% of total domestic enplanements), including highly concentrated hubs,

such as Minneapolis and Dallas.13 A legitimate concern here is that these highly concentrated

airports are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the control group (non-covered airports) in both observ-

able and unobservable ways. For example, since airport presence is known to be an important

factor in airline quality, cost, and price competition, it is troubling that we have no airports in

the control group comparable to the likes of Dallas and Minneapolis in terms of presence mea-

sures. Similarly, unobserved airport features, such a geographic location, may aﬀect the network

13Smaller airports, below the 0.25% of total domestic enplanements, are not eligible to be covered by AIR-21.
An analysis including these smaller airports gives nearly identical results. These estimates are available from the
authors upon request.

economies of an airport, leading it both to be highly concentrated and to have diﬀerent com-

petitive mechanics than less concentrated airports. The results from Berry and Jia (2010) also

give an important example of the interaction of unobservable changes in consumer preferences,

i.e. decreasing willingness to pay for quality, with observable airport presence diﬀerences.

To get around these problems we exploit AIR-21’s sharp discontinuity at the 50% two-carrier

enplanement level. Essentially, we assume the distribution of market-level unobservables changes

smoothly across the policy discontinuity. That is, the unobservable features of a randomly

chosen market just below the cutoﬀ have the same distribution as the unobservable features

of a randomly chosen market just above the cutoﬀ. Such an identiﬁcation strategy also has

the advantage of lessening concerns that other events, e.g. September 11th, near the time of

the policy intervention are inﬂuencing our results, as the event would have to have a diﬀerential

eﬀect on airports on either side of the treatment cutoﬀ. A local identiﬁcation approach, also has

the advantage of mitigating concerns regarding “mean-reversion”, or the idea that concentrated

airports tend to deconcentrate over time due to high prices and entry.

With this identiﬁcation strategy in mind we estimate the local average treatment eﬀects

(LATEs) of the law using two approaches. First, we proceed in the spirit of Black (1999)

and estimate a series of diﬀerence in diﬀerence regressions using only those observations in

progressively smaller windows around the concentration cutoﬀs determining coverage. Figure 1

demonstrates this approach. We begin by utilizing the complete sample and then examine the

subset of markets within narrower windows around the coverage cutoﬀs. Using this approach,

we identify market outcomes impacted by coverage in a statistically and economically signiﬁcant

manner. This approach also allows us to use covariates to control for observable diﬀerences in

airports and markets. This is potentially useful because, while we have a large number of

markets, these markets are drawn from a relatively small number of airports, which may create

a small sample problem even if our identifying assumption is correct. For example, New York

(JFK) is always included as a control airport and serves destinations that are larger, richer

and more distant on average than those in the treatment group, and due to the large number

of markets originating or terminating at the airport, it represents a nontrivial fraction of the

sample.

In the top half of Figure 2, we plot the cdf of per-capita income and population of destinations

served out of covered and non-covered airports. Airports covered by AIR-21 tend to serve

destinations with larger populations and higher per-capita incomes.

Figure 2, we plot the cdf of the same observables for destinations served out of airports with

two-ﬁrm concentrations within 0.1 of the treatment cutoﬀ.

In this window, the diﬀerence in

the distribution of population narrows greatly, while the diﬀerence in the right-hand tails of the

distribution of per-capita income also narrows. Figure 3 shows the two-ﬁrm concentration ratios

at each airport in 2000 and 2008, respectively.

In the second step, we employ a true RD approach and allow the window width to collapse to

zero. We ﬁnd that our main conclusions from the ﬁrst step are robust, which one would expect

given the similarity of the distribution of observables in Figure 2.

In addition, our particular

RD implementation allows us to examine variation in the eﬀect of coverage along the cutoﬀs.

We do this by deﬁning treatment eﬀects as functions of an origin’s or destination’s concentration

level, which we describe more fully below, whereas in the ﬁrst step, we identify only an average

eﬀect of coverage, ignoring potential heterogeneity in treatment eﬀects across markets.

In the

case of low-cost entry, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant heterogeneity along the treatment cutoﬀ.

Intuitively,

following implementation of the competition plans and the resulting improvement in access to

airport facilities, we ﬁnd that low-cost carriers enter more concentrated markets with greater

frequency.

4.1.1 Fares

Following Black (1999), we begin under the assumption that coverage is exogenous and homoge-

nous in its eﬀect on fares by estimating the following regression:

∆t log(Avg.F areijmt) = ∆txijmtβ+∆tzmtγ+ψN onstopijmt+τ11[1 coverm]+τ21[2 coverm]+∆tϵijmt,

(1)

using the complete sample. The dependent variable is the long second diﬀerence, the change

from 2002 to 2008 minus the change from 1993 to 1999, of the logarithm of average fares

paid by passengers who purchased product j (nonstop or connecting service) from carrier i in

market m.14 The vectors ∆txijmt and ∆tzmt include the second diﬀerences of F raction.Routes,
Distance.T raveled, and the population and per-capita income at the market endpoint airports.15

In addition, we include an indicator for nonstop service to capture the possibility that fares for

nonstop service changed diﬀerentially relative to connecting service.

To capture the impact of coverage by AIR-21 on the time-path of fares, we include indicators

for whether one or both of a market’s endpoints were covered, 1[1 coverm] and 1[2 coverm],

respectively.16 Under the assumption that coverage is exogenous and homogenous in its eﬀect

on fares, τ1 and τ2 measure the causal eﬀect on the dependent variable in a market with one

and two endpoints covered. To relax these assumptions and ensure a causal interpretation of τ1

and τ2, we estimate the same regression on the subsamples of markets in progressively smaller

windows around the coverage cutoﬀs. For such an approach to give consistent estimates, a

signiﬁcant portion of the data must be located within these windows. Figure 4(a) gives the

relative mass of the number of observations for each combination of the predictors of treatment.

Figure 4(b) provides a contour map of the density and demonstrates that the majority of the

data is in fact immediately around the coverage cutoﬀs. This is of particular importance as we

shrink the window further in the RD analysis.

The estimates of Equation (1) are presented in Columns 1, 3, and 5 of Table 4. For the

regression results presented in Tables 4-9, we calculate robust standard errors using the approach

14The DB1B ﬁrst became publicly available in 1993. The results are insensitive to varying the ﬁrst or last year

of the panel used in the analysis.

15See Berry (1990), Berry et al. (2006), and Berry and Jia (2010) for a discussion of the impact of the size of

a carrier’s network on demand for that carrier’s services.

16In earlier versions of the paper we included speciﬁcations that allowed the 1[1 coverm] treatment eﬀect to
vary according to whether the origin or destination is treated. The eﬀects were highly symmetric, so we opted
for the more parsimonious speciﬁcation.

of Cameron et al. (2007) to cluster on both the origin and destination, allowing for arbitrary

forms of correlation between observations with either the origin, destination, or both in common.

Our estimates of τ1 and τ2 are negative and statistically and economically signiﬁcant in each

window around the coverage cutoﬀ. From Column 5, where we can reasonably interpret our

coeﬃcients in a causal fashion, the results indicate that coverage of a single endpoint by AIR-

21 results in a 13.4% reduction in average fares,17 while coverage of both endpoints results in

approximately a 20.2% change in average fares. This result is robust across diﬀerent window

widths, suggesting we might safely extrapolate our local eﬀects to more highly concentrated

airports. The remaining results in Column 5 are straightforward to interpret and consistent

across all subsamples.

We interpret the results in Columns 1, 3, and 5 as estimates of the total eﬀect, both direct

and indirect, of AIR-21 on average fares.

Since we typically think of the eﬀect of barriers

to entry on fares as being indirect, barriers to entry aﬀect entry/exit and market structure

which in turn aﬀect prices, it is important to the credibility of our identiﬁcation as well as our

evaluation of the policy to try to understand the direct channels through which fares are aﬀected.

Columns 2, 4, and 6 of Table 4 show speciﬁcations designed to partially get at these channels.

17Following Halvorsen and Palmquist (1980), this is calculated as: (cid:0)13:4 = 100 (cid:3) (exp((cid:0)0:144) (cid:0) 1).

and Rose (1994) to control for any changes in the competitive environment in a market. The

set of controls includes the number of competitors in the market, an indicator for whether or

not a low-cost carrier serves the market, airport-level Herﬁndahl indices for both endpoints,

market-level Herﬁndahl indices, and an indicator for whether the carrier oﬀers both nonstop

and connecting service.18 Each of these variables enters the regression as a second diﬀerence

as described above. One can then interpret changes in the estimates of τ1 and τ2, when the

controls are included, as evidence that variation in the competitive environment explains some

portion of the estimated eﬀect of coverage. We ﬁnd that these controls explain between 30%

and 50%, depending on the window width, of the eﬀect from coverage we estimated in Columns

1, 3 and 5. Lcc.P enetration has a statistically signiﬁcant and economically meaningful eﬀect

on fares. This suggests the explanation for the large decline in fares caused by AIR-21 have

come, to a large extent, through exactly the channels envisioned by the law. While, under

our identifying assumptions, our treatment eﬀect estimates are consistent in the presence of

potentially endogenous market structure variables, we do not argue the coeﬃcients on these

variables are consistent estimates of the eﬀect of, for example, low-cost entry. However, we note

the substantial 14% declines associated with the Lcc.P enetration variable are consistent with

the range of estimates presented by Brueckner et al. (2011).19

Estimates of Equation (1) provide insight into how fares for a particular type of service in

market changed as a result of AIR-21. It is also of interest to know how the distribution of fares

in a market, as a whole, changed as a result of AIR-21. Speciﬁcally, performing the analysis

on the distribution of fares in the market as a whole serves as an informal test of whether

sample selection, on carriers serving a market over the entire period, is driving our results. If

the estimated eﬀects for coverage are similar to those of Equation (1), we can be conﬁdent that

selection is not driving our results.

For this purpose, we estimate market-level regressions of the form

∆t log(Qtile.M kt.F aremt) = ∆tzmtγ + τ11[1 coverm]+τ21[2 coverm] + ∆tϵmt,

where the dependent variable, Qtile.M kt.F aremt, is a particular quantile (e.g. 20thP ct.M kt.F are)

18We also estimated a speciﬁcation including an interaction of the nonstop indicator and the indicator for

whether the carrier oﬀers both nonstop and connecting service. This interaction was never signiﬁcant.

19Results from estimating slight variations of Equation (1) using the entire panel of data (every year from 1993
to 2008) and year-on-year ﬁrst diﬀerences are available at http://jonwms.myweb.uga.edu/research.htm. The
results are nearly identical to those presented in Table 4.

21

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1775924

of the distribution of fares in a market. Table 5 presents these estimates. For conciseness and

due to the similarity of the estimates to those in Table 4, we present only those coeﬃcients

of particular interest. Columns 2, 4, and 6 (1, 3, and 5) present the estimates with(out) the

Borenstein and Rose (1994) controls; the number of competitors in the market, an indicator

for whether or not a low-cost carrier serves the market, airport-level enplanement Herﬁndahl

indices for both endpoints, and market-level enplanement Herﬁndahl indices.

The results for Avg.M kt.F aremt, in the top panel of Table 5, are very similar to those

reported in Table 4, suggesting selection is not a concern. Additionally, consistent with the

descriptive evidence in Table 3, we ﬁnd that the estimated decline in fares resulting from cov-

erage by AIR-21 is increasing in the fare quantile. The coeﬃcients in Column 5, which we can

reasonably interpret in a causal fashion, show that there was little decline at the bottom of the

distribution as a result of coverage, while there were large and statistically signiﬁcant declines

in both 50thP ct.M kt.F are and 80thP ct.M kt.F are. 50thP ct.M kt.F are declines 8.6% (19.0%)

when one (both) endpoint(s) is (are) covered, while 80thP ct.M kt.F are declines 10.1% (21.6%).

Inclusion of the Borenstein and Rose (1994) controls, low-cost carrier entry in particular, again

explains away up to 50% of the estimated eﬀect from coverage. Consistent with low-cost carriers

successfully targeting business travelers, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of low-cost entry to be larger in the

upper quantiles of the fare distribution.

The last measure of the impact of AIR-21 on fares that we examine is the eﬀect on the

dominant carrier premium, Avg.Dominant.P remiummt. We measure the hub premium as the

diﬀerence in the logarithm of the average fare charged in a market by the carriers with the

largest presence at the market’s endpoints with that of its competitors. These premia range

from roughly 15-40% in 1999 and, on average, are sharply increasing in the concentration of an

airport. Table 6 reports the results of these regressions. The magnitudes of the estimates are

similar across diﬀerent window widths, but not always statistically signiﬁcant.

If we focus on

Column 5, the narrowest window, we ﬁnd that these premia have fallen slightly faster in markets

with one or both endpoints covered, although, the coeﬃcient on 1[2 cover] is not statistically

signiﬁcant. These results suggest, at most, AIR-21 had a modest impact on reducing premia

charged by dominant carriers, despite the success of AIR-21 in reducing fares overall.

22

4.1.2 Quality

In addition to fares, many other characteristics of service may change as the result of coverage

by AIR-21. GAO (2001) suggests that granting authority to regulators to force dominant

carriers at certain airports to divest critical assets (e.g. boarding gates) introduces uncertainty

and can lead to disinvestment in an airport.

In particular, GAO (2001) suggests service to

smaller airports would be the ﬁrst to be aﬀected, possibly losing service altogether.

If the

fare reductions are accompanied by diminished service quality, then the welfare consequences of

coverage are ambiguous. We focus on three critical dimensions of service quality, the availability

of nonstop service (percentage of passengers ﬂying nonstop in a market), the on-time performance

of carriers (fraction of ﬂights delayed ﬁfteen minutes of more), and the number of markets served

by a carrier out of an airport (number of destinations served on a connecting or nonstop basis

by a carrier out of an airport).

To estimate the impact of coverage on the availability of nonstop service, we estimate the

following regression:

∆tP ct.N onstopmt = ∆tzmtγ + τ11[1 coverm]+τ21[2 coverm] + ∆tϵmt

where ∆tP ct.N onstopmt denotes the second diﬀerence, constructed identically to the dependent

variable in Equation (1), in the fraction of passengers ﬂying nonstop in market m. To examine

the impact of coverage on the frequency of late ﬂights on any nonstop ﬂight segment s, we

estimate the following regression:

∆tP (Delay (cid:21) 15)st = ∆tzstγ + τ11[1 coverm]+τ21[2 coverm] + ∆tϵst,

where P (Delay (cid:21) 15) is the fraction of ﬂights delayed ﬁfteen minutes or more. Finally, to
capture any potential divestiture by carriers in an airport resulting from coverage by AIR-21,

we estimate the following regression:

∆t log(N umber.Routesiat) = ∆tzatγ + τ 1[1 covera] + ∆tϵiat

where the unit of observation is at the carrier (i)-airport (a) level.

The results of these regressions are presented in Table 7. The GAO (2001) was most con-

cerned that AIR-21 might lead carriers to completely cease operations or reduce the number of

destinations served from covered airports. We do not ﬁnd robust evidence that the range of

destinations oﬀered by carriers was impacted negatively by coverage; however, the large amount

23

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1775924

of noise in these regressions and the variation in the point estimates make it diﬃcult to draw

ﬁrm conclusions. With regard to delays, consistent with the ﬁndings of Forbes (2008), we

ﬁnd weak evidence of an increase in the proportion of late ﬂights, however this result is not

robust across all windows.20 This is an intuitive result. Mayer and Sinai (2003) ﬁnd that

carriers controlling the majority of the operations at an airport have an incentive to internalize

congestion-related delays. At covered airports, a number of gates were seized from dominant

carriers and subsequently operated by the airport authority, a third party with a lesser incentive

to minimize delays of any particular carrier or ﬂight. Besides an increase in delays, we ﬁnd

that the proportion of passengers ﬂying nonstop declines slightly as a result of coverage. While

diﬃcult to test, a likely explanation is a change in the composition of passengers in covered

markets, such that those consumers brought into the market as a result of the large declines in

fares are more price sensitive and prefer cheaper connecting service.

If it were not for such a signiﬁcant decline in fares, conclusions regarding consumer welfare

would be-and to a signiﬁcant degree still are-less clear, as it would require an unreasonably high

opportunity cost of time (associated with increased delays and connections) to completely oﬀset

an 19% reduction in the median fare. However, this ﬁnding speaks to the idea that AIR-21 may

have been suboptimally focused on the reallocation of scarce facilities rather than expansion of

the facilities.

4.1.3 Quantity

For the decrease in fares in covered markets to be welfare improving for consumers, we should not

observe statistically signiﬁcant declines in passenger traﬃc in these markets. We have shown

there are only minor declines in measurable aspects of service quality. Observing declines

in passenger volumes would suggest that other, unobserved, aspects of service (e.g. quality)

declined along with fares in covered markets. To measure the eﬀect of coverage on passenger

volumes, we run the following regression:

∆t log(P assijmt) = ∆txijmtβ +∆tzmtγ +ψN onstopijmt +τ11[1 coverm]+τ21[2 coverm]+∆tϵijmt,

where P assijmt is the number of passengers traveling, either nonstop or connecting, j, with

carrier i in market m, as reported in the DB1B data. The vectors ∆txijmt and ∆tzmt include

20In unreported results, we included a variety of measures to attempt to measure congestion and concentration
to try to explain the observed increase in the frequency of late ﬂights.
Interestingly, none of these measures
explain away any portion of the measured eﬀect of coverage. This leaves very few possible explanations other
than a change in control over the management of the scarce airport facilities.

the same controls as in Equation (1).

The results of these regressions are reported in Table 8. Columns 2, 4, and 6 (1, 3, and 5)

report the results with(out) the Borenstein and Rose (1994) controls for diﬀerent window widths.

Column 5 indicates that coverage, on average, had a positive and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect

on passenger volumes. Passenger volumes rose approximately 20.3% (42.2%) in markets with

one (both) endpoint(s) covered, consistent with the large coverage eﬀect for fares reported in

Table 4. The large increase in passenger volumes suggests that the increase in delays did little

to diminish the beneﬁt to consumers resulting from the large decline in fares. Column 6 shows

that inclusion of the Borenstein and Rose (1994) controls explains away much of the estimated

eﬀect on passenger volumes from coverage. Low-cost entry in covered markets drives nearly all

of the increase in passenger volumes.

4.1.4 Competition

The results in Tables 4, 5, and 8 suggest that increased competition, particularly by low-cost

carriers, explains a signiﬁcant portion of the variation in fares and increases in passenger volumes

in covered markets. However, it is not clear whether this increase in competition is driven by

coverage. To test whether the steps taken by covered airports had a signiﬁcant impact on the

number and identify of ﬁrms, we estimate two regressions:

∆tN umber.F irmsmt = ∆tzmtγ + τ11[1 coverm]+τ21[2 coverm] + ∆ϵmt

and

∆tLcc.P enetrationmt = ∆tzmtγ + τ11[1 coverm]+τ21[2 coverm] + ∆ϵmt

where the dependent variables in these regressions are the number of ﬁrms serving the market

and an indicator for whether a low-cost carrier is present, respectively.

The estimates of the coeﬃcients on the coverage indicators are presented in Table 9. We

ﬁnd that for markets with one (both) endpoint(s) covered there is a 0.11 (0.40) increase in

the probability of a low-cost carrier serving the market. While there are obvious caveats in

interpreting the coeﬃcients of a second diﬀerenced linear probability model, at a minimum, this

corroborates our ﬁnding that variation in the low-cost indicator played a major role in explaining

between 30% and 50% of the reduction in fares as a result of coverage. We ﬁnd AIR-21 has no

signiﬁcant impact on the average number of ﬁrms serving a market.

4.2 Regression Discontinuity Design

As discussed above there are many strengths associated with the approach of Black (1999). The

results, however, rely on a number of assumptions, including homogeneity of the coverage eﬀect

and exogeneity of coverage, to estimate the eﬀects of coverage by AIR-21. These assumptions

can be troublesome because more concentrated airports (those with two carriers enplaning more

than 50% of the passengers) are treated, while less concentrated airports are not. Therefore,

any covariation between fares and concentration after the ﬁrst quarter of 2001 (the time of

the treatment) would be empirically indistinguishable from a treatment eﬀect due to AIR-21.

While these assumptions are diﬃcult to test formally, it is possible to measure a local-average

treatment eﬀect (LATE) around the treatment cutoﬀ in the absence of these assumptions using a

RD approach. Examining treatment and control groups “very near”either side of the treatment

cutoﬀ allows us to disentangle those movements in fares that result from coverage from those

that are simply due to correlation between fares and concentration. We discuss our approach

below.21

4.2.1 De(cid:12)ning LATEs

Estimation of the LATEs here is complicated by the two-dimensional predictor vector. Instead
of a point, our LATE estimates are now functions of the predictors or treatment, P orig
m and
m . Let Yijmt(o, d), o, d 2 f0, 1g, denote the outcome variable when the origin treatment
P dest

status is o and the destination treatment status is d. For each observation, we get to observe

one of the four possible values of the variable. When only one endpoint is treated we deﬁne the

LATEs as

m ) = E[Yimt(1, 0) (cid:0) Yimt(0, 0)jP orig
(P dest

and when both endpoints are treated,

(P orig

m = .5P dest

m > .5]

m > .5P dest

m = .5]

Our deﬁnition of treatment eﬀects is motivated by several considerations. First are identiﬁca-

tion considerations. Our data are lumpy in the sense that the predictors of coverage do not vary

21See Imbens and Lemieux (2008) for an introduction to RD and Hahn, Todd, and Van Der Klaauw (2001) for

a detailed discussion of identiﬁcation of treatment eﬀects within an RD framework.

within an airport, so for a suﬃciently small window around a given concentration level, all the

markets in that window will be drawn from a single airport. For example, consider Dallas-Fort

Worth (DFW), which has a predictor value of around 0.8, well away from the coverage cutoﬀ.

The estimate of τ 2

dest(0.8) compares the path of fares over the period since the passage of AIR-21
in markets originating at DFW and terminating at airports just below the coverage cutoﬀ to

those markets originating at DFW and terminating at airports just above the coverage cutoﬀ.

This approach allows us to control, to some extent, for ﬁxed unobserved factors associated with

given airports that are potentially distant from the coverage cutoﬀs. Second, in contrast to

the window regressions, allowing the treatment eﬀect to vary along the treatment cutoﬀ in ad-

dition to the local linear regression implementation, discussed below, we estimate the eﬀect of

coverage more ﬂexibly. Figure 4 shows the majority of the observations are near the treatment

cutoﬀ, making such a ﬂexible approach feasible. Moreover, Berry and Jia (2010) suggest there

is direct evidence that the treatment eﬀects may diﬀer in airport concentration. Of course, the

interpretation of our estimates as a ﬂexible interactive eﬀect is invalid if there is selection inher-

ent in conditioning on the away-from-the-boundary-airport concentration level, which is likely

given that a single airport will dominate any small bin. However, even in the presence of such

selection, we can still interpret the estimates as an estimate of LATE heterogeneity where the

heterogeneity corresponds to interaction with whatever is driving selection.

Our major task in estimation is to adapt the basic RD framework to account for a two-

relates Yimt to fP orig

dimensional predictor vector. This requires ﬂexibly estimating a two-dimensional surface that
g. Local linear estimators are particularly attractive for this type of
problem; see Imbens and Lemieux (2008). At boundary points of the support for the predictor

m , P dest

m

vector, local linear estimators do not suﬀer from the inherent bias of kernel estimators and

achieve faster rates of convergence.

In addition, local linear estimators are easily extended to

multiple dimensions. Fan and Gijbels (1996) provide a detailed discussion of the advantages of

local-polynomial modeling.

To demonstrate our approach, suppose we are estimating τ orig

To simplify the choice of bandwidth in multiple dimensions, we transform the predictors of

Ullah (1999). This allows us to check the sensitivity of our results by varying a single factor of

proportionality, k, such that both horig and hdest are equal to

for all the RD analysis, which allows for a great deal of ﬂexibility, as we will discuss below, yet

adequately smooths the surface.22

22We also explored cross-validation methods for choosing k, but we ﬁnd it performs very poorly in our application
by suggesting a bandwidth near zero that overﬁts the data. A few aspects of our application and the method
(interdependence of observations, multiple dimensional predictor vector, and the slow convergence rate of the
cross-validation method) make this an unsurprising result.

Calculating asymptotically valid standard errors for our estimates is a nontrivial computa-

tional exercise for a number of reasons. First, we are estimating a nonparametric surface in

multiple dimensions. Second, we are most interested in the estimates of this nonparametric sur-

face at the coverage cutoﬀs. Finally, we must account for the dependence in our data resulting

from markets having endpoints in common, as was the case in the window regressions. For these

reasons, we appeal to the resampling with dependent data literature to calculate asymptotically

valid point-wise standard errors. For a detailed treatment of resampling techniques for depen-

dent data, see Lahiri (2003). The clear dependence structure in our data makes application

of these techniques straightforward. We treat the sample as representative of the population

and compute jack-knife standard errors where we leave out blocks of markets with a common

endpoint. Precisely, for each airport we ﬁnd all markets with a common endpoint and drop

them from the sample. Using the resulting sub-sample, we then reestimate the model. We

repeat this process for each market and use the distribution of the estimates across subsamples

to infer moments of the asymptotic distribution of our LATEs.

4.2.2 Results

The results and conclusions of our RD analysis are consistent and nearly identical to our ﬁndings

using the window-regression approach. For this reason, we focus the discussion of our RD results

on the impact of coverage on fares and low-cost competition. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) present the

surfaces relating second diﬀerences of the average fare and low-cost penetration, ∆tAvg.F areijmt

and ∆tLcc.P enetrationmt, respectively, to the predictors of treatment, where we smooth over

the policy discontinuity. Foreshadowing the results from our RD analysis, we ﬁnd the gradient

of the surface changes rapidly around the treatment cutoﬀs in a way that is consistent with the

results from the window regressions.

In particular, there are four clearly visible planes in each

of the surfaces, corresponding to the four quadrants in Figure 1.

Figure 6 shows the estimated surface for a representative region of the surface relating the

second diﬀerence of average fares to the predictors of treatment, along with the data used in

estimation in the same region, when we allow for a break at the coverage cutoﬀ. The ﬁgure makes

clear that our RD is not as clear as many in the literature, in the sense that the discontinuity is

not plainly visible. This is not surprising due to the high variability in fares, two-dimensional

support of our predictors, and clumpiness of the data. This motivates our two-dimensional

smoothing procedure.

Figures 7(a) and 7(b) and Table 10 present the complete results of our RD analysis of fares

and low-cost entry. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) shows the RD surfaces, relating average fares and

low-cost entry to the predictors of treatment, respectively, while allowing for a break in the

surface at the coverage cutoﬀs. Not surprisingly, given the smoothed surfaces in Figures 5(a)

and 5(b), and our ﬁndings from the window regressions, we ﬁnd economically and statistically

signiﬁcant breaks along the coverage cutoﬀs for both market outcomes. Table 10 presents the

point estimates along with standard errors, calculated using the block-bootstrapping procedure

discussed above. Collectively, the results of our RD analysis both corroborate and provide

additional insights to the ﬁndings gleaned from the window regressions.

The RD estimates of the eﬀect on average fares of going from no endpoints treated to one

endpoint treated range from 12 to 15 percent, only slightly larger than our ﬁndings from the

window regressions. The eﬀect of going from no coverage to both endpoints covered, if measured

as the jump right at the vertex of the four surfaces, is about 27 percent (15.8 plus 11.6 or 15.6

plus 11.3). While, strictly speaking, this is the only correct way to measure this eﬀect, averaging

over the surfaces suggests the eﬀect is around 18-21 percent. The reason for this diﬀerences

is that unlike the window regressions we don’t impose symmetric eﬀects for the one-endpoint

treated markets, and, as Figure 7(a) shows, we ﬁnd substantial heterogeneity in the LATEs

for the eﬀect of coverage for the second market endpoint. Speciﬁcally, the eﬀect of coverage

is substantial and statistically signiﬁcant for less-concentrated airports (about 0.5), while not

statistically diﬀerent from zero for more-concentrated airports (0.6 or greater).23

For low-cost penetration, the magnitudes of the estimates are slightly smaller and exhibit

some interesting patterns. As discussed above, one advantage of employing a true RD approach

in our application is the opportunity to look for heterogeneity in the eﬀect of coverage. This

heterogeneity is obvious as one looks at the point estimates of the eﬀect from coverage on low-

cost penetration in Table 10. This heterogeneity is also clearly visible in Figure 7(b). Looking
at the estimates of τ orig

m ), we ﬁnd a nearly monotonic relationship between concentration

(P dest

1

and the eﬀect of coverage on low-cost entry, ranging from a point estimate of 0.024 to 0.218. As

one would expect, coverage had its largest eﬀect on entry in more concentrated markets. This

explains why we get a statistically insigniﬁcant point estimate for the coeﬃcient on 1[1 coverm]

in the window regressions, where we can identify only an average eﬀect of coverage. The eﬀect

of going from no endpoint to both endpoints being covered, again measured at the jump of the

vertex between the four surfaces, is 0.28 and 0.31. This implies that approximately 3 additional

markets out of every 10, with a two-ﬁrm concentration of above 0.5, have a low-cost presence

as a result of AIR-21. Consistent with the fare estimates, we ﬁnd only a moderate increase

23The symmetry of the surface remains and the results are nearly identical if the return legs of roundtrip tickets

are not used in computing fares. See the online appendix for details.

Collectively, our results suggest that coverage had the largest eﬀect, fare declines and increased

low-cost penetration, on moderately concentrated airports.

4.2.3 Regression-Discontinuity Validity

Above, we have discussed why we are comfortable assuming there are no (local) selection eﬀects

associated with AIR-21. The validity of our identifying assumption also requires there be no

problem with incentive eﬀects. That is, that carriers do not manipulate enplanement levels to

avoid treatment. There are a number of reasons why we believe this is a valid assumption.

First, coverage is determined at the airport level, not the airline level. Therefore, no individual

airline can manipulate enplanements and entirely determine coverage; rather it would take a

cooperative eﬀort by airlines serving the airport. Second, coverage in each year was determined

using FAA enplanement data from two years earlier. An airline attempting to avoid coverage by

the legislation would have been required to foresee the exact details of the legislation (including

the exact enplanement cutoﬀ) two years in advance of its passage.24 Finally, manipulating

24We also examined enplanements of airports near the coverage cutoﬀ in the years prior to AIR-21, 1998-2000.
We ﬁnd no evidence that concentration measures changed in a way that would suggest airports or carriers knew
of the particular value of the coverage cutoﬀ.

Figure 8: Test for Strategic Manipulation

enplanements at any one airport, particularly a large airport, has signiﬁcant costs to an airline

in terms of adjusting traﬃc in its entire network.

Extending formal tests to check for the strategic manipulation of enplanements, see McCrary

(2008), with a two-dimensional predictor vector is not immediately clear. However, we develop

an informal test for manipulation of the predictors of treatment and provide evidence that

little or no strategic manipulation of enplanements occurred. The test is based on the simple

observation that those airports just below the coverage cutoﬀ in which one carrier controls a

larger proportion of the traﬃc will be most vulnerable to strategic manipulation of enplanements.

For example, consider two airports where the two largest carriers enplane 49% of the passengers.

Suppose at the ﬁrst airport, the top carrier enplanes 35% of all passengers while the top carrier

at the second airport enplanes 25% of all passengers.

If an airline was attempting to avoid

coverage of an airport by AIR-21 by manipulating enplanements, one would expect this to occur

at the ﬁrst airport. At the ﬁrst airport, the largest carrier would have greater control in ensuring

that the airport was not covered.

One way a carrier can lower enplanements is by raising fares.

If a carrier was seeking to

raise fares and lower its share of enplanements to avoid coverage, one would expect to see less

of a drop in fares in markets near the coverage cutoﬀ where one carrier has a larger share of

enplanements were manipulated.

In Figure 8(a), we plot the joint density of the share of the

two largest carriers and the share of the largest carrier for airports below the cutoﬀ. Given the

high correlation between these two variables, we can plot only the relationship between these

variables and changes in fares (diﬀerence between average fare in the ﬁrst quarter of 2008 and

2001), for a small range of values in Figure 8(b).

If carriers chose to strategically manipulate

enplanements, we would expect to see a surface sloping up in the top carrier’s share at airports

closest to the cutoﬀ. We ﬁnd no evidence to support this claim.

5 Conclusions

High fares at concentrated airports have been a fact of life in U.S. air travel since the deregulation

of the industry in 1979. The welfare implications of these high fares are ambiguous because

consumers value both the size and scope, in the form of frequency and network size, of an airline

when ﬂying out of their home airport. However size and scope lead to market power due to

scarce airport facilities.

In 2000, the U.S. Congress took a stand on the question, deciding

too much market power at highly concentrated airports was generating too much of the fare

diﬀerence and enacted AIR-21. Among other things, AIR-21 required concentrated airports to

take steps to increase competition and make airport facilities available to all carriers wanting to

serve the airport.

We have provided evidence that AIR-21 was successful in encouraging new and intensiﬁed

competition at its targeted airports. Moreover, we have found evidence that Congress was right

in concluding that market power contributed too much to high fares from the perspective of

consumers. That is, we ﬁnd little evidence that increased competition has signiﬁcantly eroded

quality provision, either directly by reducing large incumbent size or indirectly by disincentiving

high frequencies. The only meaningful degradation of service quality we ﬁnd has come in the

on time performance of airlines at treated airports. The magnitude of these changes in service

quality relative to the magnitude of fare declines, along with the fact that we see increases in

passenger volumes suggest AIR-21 had a strongly positive eﬀect on consumer welfare.

Our quasi-experimental approach to analyzing the impact of barriers to entry is somewhat

novel in the Industrial Organization literature, and we think our clean identiﬁcation strategy

represents a signiﬁcant contribution to it. However, our study also highlights some of the

diﬃculties in implementing such a research design. While we can explain between 40% to

34

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1775924

50% of the decline in fares in covered markets, a result of intensiﬁed competition from low-cost

carriers, it remains an open question to identify other determinants. Moreover, if we had arrived

at more nuanced results (e.g. more signiﬁcant declines in quality and no increase in passenger

volumes), we would need more structure to say much about the balance of welfare gains and

losses.

The competition plans and subsequent FAA reports provide at least a subset of the actions

taken by airports and seem to provide a good source for identifying other possible explanations.

A couple candidates that seem likely to have some explanatory power are the reduction of

landing fees for smaller carriers to the levels enjoyed by large presence incumbents as well as

limits on subleasing fees that can be charged by one carrier to another for the use of under-

utilized boarding gates. Both these steps, discussed in the majority of the airports’ competition

plans, could be a signiﬁcant source of cost pass-throughs from carriers to consumers. Carriers

may also simply reduce fares to generate outcomes consistent with the goals of AIR-21 to avoid

additional oversight in the future. We leave more detailed investigation of these channels for

future research.

6 Appendix: Data Description and Construction of Variables

In this appendix, we detail the construction of our sample and calculation of each variable.25

6.1 DB1B Data

Data describing the itinerary and fare paid by each passenger were collected from the Databank
1B (DB1B) of the DOT’s Origin and Destination Survey for 1993 to 2008. The DB1B is a
10 percent random sample of all domestic air travel on U.S. carriers. The DB1B data were
processed as follows:

1. The following itineraries are removed from the sample: those with the ticketing carrier
missing or an inaccurate fare as reported by the DOT (tktdollarcred equals 1), those
associated with interline or open-jaw travel, roundtrip (one-way) itineraries with more than
6 (3) coupons (ﬂight segments), and those with an endpoint that is neither a medium or a
large hub, as classiﬁed by the FAA (at least 0.25% of domestic enplanements). Itineraries
booked with a carrier’s subsidiaries or regional aﬃliates are not regarded as interline travel
and remain in the sample, and are recoded as travel with the parent carrier.

2. Roundtrip itineraries are coded as two separate trips, travel in two separate directional
markets.26 For example, a roundtrip itinerary, originating in Atlanta (ATL) and termi-
nating in Cleveland (CLE), is coded as travel in two markets, ATL-CLE and CLE-ATL.
Roundtrip fares are divided by two and deﬂated to 2008 dollars using the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics’ consumer price index. Itineraries with fares less than $25 or greater than
$2500 are regarded as key-punch errors or redemption of frequent-ﬂier miles and removed
from the sample.

3. Each trip by a passenger is classiﬁed as either nonstop or connecting (at least one connec-

tion) service.

Similar to Berry (1992) and Ciliberto and Tamer (2009), we consider a carrier to oﬀer a
particular type of service (nonstop or connecting) in a market if the carrier reports at least 10
passengers in the DB1B (100 passengers due to 10% sampling) purchasing that particular type
of service. We remove itineraries associated with market-carrier-types of service that do not meet
this threshold. The ﬁnal sample includes the following carriers; AA, AQ, AS, CO, DL, HA,
HP, NW, UA, US, YX, B6, FL, F9, G4, J7,KP, KN, N7, NJ, NK, P9, QQ, SY, SX, TZ, U5,
VX, W7, W9, WN, WV, XP, and ZA,and a total of 2,979 markets.

From this sample of the DB1B data, the variables used in the analysis above are constructed

as follows:

Avg.Fareijmt is calculated as the weighted average (weights are number of passengers paying
a particular fare) of fares for a type of service, j (nonstop or connecting), across all passengers

25The Stata .do ﬁles used to construct the sample from the raw DOT data are available from the authors upon

request.

26The results and conclusions are virtually identical if the return leg of roundtrip tickets are completely removed
from the sample. This is not surprising, as airlines nearly always price roundtrip travel in opposite directions
similarly.

traveling in a market, m, with a particular carrier i. For example, if Delta oﬀers both nonstop
and connecting service in the ATL-CLE market, two separate averages are computed.

Passijmt is calculated as the total number of passengers for a type of service, j (nonstop or

connecting), traveling in a market, m, with a particular carrier i.

Qtile.Mkt.Faremt is calculated for various quantiles of the fare distribution across all carriers
in a market. The number of passengers paying a particular fare are used as weights in computing
these quantiles, using the fweight option in Stata. We compute 3 quantiles, 20thP ct.M kt.F are,
50thP ct.M kt.F are, 80thP ct.M kt.F are, and the average, Avg.M kt.F are.

Avg.Dominant.Premiummt is calculated in two steps. For each market, we identify two
carriers, the carriers with the largest presence at the origin and destination, respectively. A
carrier’s presence at an airport is measured by the number of enplanements at an airport,
measured from the DB1B data.27 For each market, we then compute two averages; one is
the average fare charged by the dominant carriers, while the other is the average fare charged
by all other carriers. These averages are computed in the same fashion as Qtile.M kt.F aremt,
where the number of passengers paying a given fare are used as weights. The dominant carrier
premium is then the diﬀerence between these two averages.

Pct.Nonstopmt is calculated as the fraction of passengers, across all carriers, in a market

that travel nonstop.

Number.Routesiat is calculated as the number of destinations that a carrier serves on either
a nonstop or connecting basis out of airport, a. A destination out of airport a is considered to
be served by a carrier if at least one itinerary appears in the DB1B with this destination that
originates at airport a. For example, if Delta serves 150 markets out of ATL on a nonstop basis
and 100 markets on a connecting basis, while oﬀering both types of service in 50 markets, then
the number of routes is equal to 200.

Fraction.Routesiat is calculated as the fraction of all routes served by any carrier on either
a nonstop or connecting basis that are served by carrier i at airport a. More precisely, the
fraction of routes is NumberRoutesiat divided by the total number of destinations served out
of an airport by any carrier. For example, if Delta serves 200 markets out of ATL and the
total number of destinations served out of ATL by any carrier is 250, then the fraction of routes
served by Delta is 0.8.

Number.Firmsmt is calculated as the total number of carriers serving a market on either a
nonstop or connecting basis. A carrier is included in this total if at least one itinerary in the
DB1B reports this carrier as the ticketing carrier in the market.

Lcc.Penetrationmt is an binary indicator for whether there a low-cost carrier serving a
market. A low-cost carrier is counted as serving a market if at least one itinerary in the DB1B
reports this carrier as the ticketing carrier in the market.28 The following carriers are regarded
as low-cost carriers; B6, FL, F9, G4, J7, KP, KN, N7, NJ, NK, P9, QQ, SY, SX, TZ, U5, VX,
W7, W9, WN, WV, XP, and ZA.

27More accurate enplanement data from the FAA were not available dating back to 1993.
28In deﬁning both the N umber:F irmsmt and Lcc:P enetrationmt, we explored diﬀerent thresholds to deﬁne
whether a carrier ”serves a market”, similar to Berry (1992) and Ciliberto and Tamer (2009), with no diﬀerence
in our results.

39

Distance.Traveledijmt is the average distance, in 1000s of miles, traveled by passengers
purchasing a particular type of service, j, from carrier i in market m. Similar to the calculation
of Avg.F areijmt, the weights are number of passengers traveling a particular distance.29

6.2 On-Time Performance Data

Data on the on-time performance of carriers were collected from the DOT’s Airline On-Time
Database. We collapse the raw data to the segment-quarter level, averaging delays across
carriers within a segment-quarter. We then merge the resulting data set with the DB1B
sample. Similar to the merge of the T100 database, there are nonstop segments that do not
appear in the delays data, but correspond to markets served in the DB1B data, explaining the
smaller sample used in our analysis of delays in the text above. From these data, we construct
one variable:

P(Delay (cid:21) 15)st is calculated as the fraction of delays greater than or equal to ﬁfteen minutes

across all carriers on a nonstop segment, s.

6.3 FAA Enplanement Data

We collected the exact enplanement data used by the FAA to determine coverage for airports by
AIR-21. There are a couple important diﬀerences between these data and the publicly available
data from the DOT; the FAA data include both on-demand (e.g. charter ﬂights) and in-transit
(e.g. plane stops to refuel but does not deplane) passengers. At many airports, this is not a
signiﬁcant source of passengers, often less than 1% at most airports. However, these subtle
diﬀerences are important for our application. First, at some airports these passengers make up
a signiﬁcant proportion of enplanements and one would incorrectly infer coverage from the DOT
enplanement data. Second, we need to know each airport’s precise value for the predictors of
treatment to perform the RD analysis.

We use the enplanement data for two purposes. First, we identify those airports the FAA
classiﬁes as a medium or large hub, enplaning at least 0.25% of enplanements, as they are the
Second, we use the data to calculate each
only airports eligible to be covered by AIR-21.
market’s predictor of treatment, fP orig
m are calculated as the maximum
of the two-ﬁrm concentration from 1998 to 2008 for the origin and destination, respectively.
It
is important to note that once an airport is covered, even if subsequent values of the predictor
falls below the coverage cutoﬀ, it is required to complete and execute a competition plan.

6.4 Airport Survey Data

We collected data on access to boarding gates as part of a survey conducted jointly with the
ACI-NA, a trade organization for airports in North America. The survey was completed by
47% of all airports classiﬁed by the FAA as a medium or large hub between 1998 and 2008.
We observe the number of gates leased by each carrier on an exclusive or preferential basis, and
the number of gates reserved for common-use by the airport authority. We calculated three

changing the routing of connecting service.

variables from these data; the total number of gates leased by low-cost carriers, the number of
gates leased by other (legacy) carriers, and the number of common-use gates. The sum of these
three variables equals the total number of gates at the airport. We observe these data for both
2001 and 2008.
