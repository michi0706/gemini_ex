Can Small Incentives Have Large Effects? The Impact of 

Taxes versus Bonuses on Disposable Bag Use†

By Tatiana A. Homonoff*

This paper examines a simple element of financial incentive—design 
whether the incentive takes the form of a fee for bad behavior or a 
reward for good behavior—to determine if the framing of the incen-
tive influences the policy’s effectiveness. I investigate the effect of two 
similar policies aimed at reducing disposable bag use: a  $0.05 tax 
on disposable bag use and a   $0.05 bonus for reusable bag use. While 
the tax decreased disposable bag use by over 40 percentage points, 
the bonus generated virtually no effect on behavior. These results are 
consistent with a model of loss aversion. (JEL D12, D91, H23)

When can small incentives have large effects on behavior? Standard economic 

theory  suggests  that  financial  incentives  aimed  at  encouraging  desirable 
behaviors  or  discouraging  harmful  behaviors  will  be  effective  only  if  the  magni-
tude of the incentive exceeds the costs an individual associates with changing his 
behavior. While in practice financial incentives can take the form of either a fee for 
bad behavior or a reward for good behavior, the standard model suggests that indi-
viduals should respond similarly to the two types of incentives provided that they 
are of the same monetary amount. In contrast, evidence from the field of behavioral 
economics suggests that individuals perceive losses more strongly than gains, i.e., 
they are “ loss-averse,” implying that a fee would be more effective than a reward 
of the same size (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). A growing body of research aims 
to document this  gain-loss asymmetry using field data in a variety of contexts.1 For 
example, Field (2009) finds that public interest tuition subsidies are significantly 
more effective when framed as a loss than as a gain. Fryer et al. (2012) and Hossain 
and  List (2012)  find  similar  patterns  for   pay-for-performance  bonuses.  However, 
less is known about whether this  gain-loss asymmetry holds in the field for very

small stakes incentives.2 In fact, evidence from a separate area of behavioral eco-
nomics suggests that offering very small incentives for behavior change can actually 
be demotivating by crowding out an individual’s intrinsic motivation (Gneezy and 
Rustichini 2000a, b; Gneezy, Meier, and  Rey-Biel 2011). This paper contributes to 
the literature on  loss-framed nudges in a new policy context where the incentives 
considered are very small in magnitude. Specifically, I investigate whether the fram-
ing of an incentive has an impact on the policy’s effectiveness through the evaluation 
of two  real-world policies aimed at reducing the use of disposable shopping bags: a 
 $0.05 tax on disposable bag use and a  $0.05 bonus for reusable bag use.

Concern  over  the  environmental  impact  of  plastic  bags  has  prompted  several 
governments  across  the  world  to  regulate  the  use  of  disposable  bags.  In  2010, 
Washington, DC became the first city in the United States to pass legislation calling 
for grocery stores to tax customers for the use of disposable bags. Two years later, 
the neighboring County of Montgomery, Maryland also passed a law requiring a 
 $0.05 tax per disposable bag. Since then, similar legislation has been passed in sev-
eral counties and cities across the United States.

While these laws  were the first policies in  the United  States  to tax  disposable 
bags, they were not the first policies to offer financial incentives that discouraged 
disposable bag use. Prior to the implementation of the tax, several stores in the area 
offered their own incentive to reduce the use of disposable bags: a $0.05 bonus for 
reusable bag use. If disposable and reusable bags are substitutes, standard models 
predict that the tax policy and the bonus policy should have the same impact on bag 
use  since  both  policies  provide  customers  a   $0.05  incentive  for  using  a  reusable 
bag instead of a disposable bag. However, if customers are  loss-averse, in that they 
adjust their behavior more in response to losses than to gains, a bonus is likely to be 
less effective than a tax of the same magnitude.

Despite  the  growing  popularity  of  policies  that  incentivize  reusable  bag  use, 
rigorous  empirical  work  measuring  the  effectiveness  of  such  policies  has  been 
lacking.3  To  assess  the  impact  of  these  policies,  I  collected  a  unique  dataset  on 
 individual-level use of disposable and reusable bags by observing shopping behavior 
of grocery store customers during the months before and after the implementation of 
the Montgomery County tax in three counties in the Washington Metropolitan Area: 
Washington, DC (which had a tax throughout the study period), Arlington County, 
Virginia (which had proposed a tax, but never passed one), and Montgomery County, 
Maryland (which changed its policy during the study period). The final dataset con-
tains information on bag use for over 16,000 customers. Using variation in incentive 

2 One exception considers the framing of  pay-for-performance bonuses for standardized test performance for 
Chicago public school children in the range of $10 to $20 and finds similar evidence of loss aversion (Levitt et al. 
2016). However, one could argue that these incentives are actually rather large for the population of interest. 
3 Two  exceptions  are  recent  studies  conducted  in  California  by Taylor  and  Villas-Boas (2016)  and  Chicago 
(http://www.ideas42.org/ wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ Chicagoans-Reduce-Disposable-Bag-Use-by-Over-Forty-
Percent-Since-Implementation-of-Checkout-Bag-Tax.pdf),  both  of  which  follow  the  same  research  design  used 
in this paper. While the tax policies considered are slightly different than those in the Washington metropolitan 
area—the California law banned  single-use plastic bags and required stores to charge a minimum fee of $0.05 for all 
other bags (paper or reusable plastic bags) and the Chicago law required stores to levy a  $0.07 tax for all disposable 
bags—the two studies found very similar effects on disposable bag use as those reported in this paper. Neither of 
these studies compared the effect of the tax to the effect of a comparably sized reusable bag bonus.

policies across time and location, I investigate whether the framing of the incentive 
influences the policy’s effectiveness.

Using a  difference-in-differences analysis, I find that, while 82 percent of custom-
ers in Montgomery County used at least one disposable bag per shopping trip prior 
to the tax, this fraction declined by 42 percentage points after the tax was imple-
mented. Additionally, customers who continued to use disposable bags after the tax 
used fewer bags per trip, leading to an overall reduction in demand of just over one 
disposable bag per shopping trip. If each household in Montgomery County were to 
shop once per week, these effects would imply a reduction of over 18 million dis-
posable bags per year. These results are particularly surprising given the small size 
of the financial incentive—$0.05 per bag.

In  contrast  to  the  overwhelming  impact  of  the   $0.05  tax,  I  find  that  a   $0.05 
bonus  for  reusable  bag  use  had  almost  no  impact  on  disposable  bag  use.  Using 
 cross-sectional  variation  in  policies  across  stores,  as  there  was  no  change  in  the 
bonus policy during the study period, I find that customers shopping in stores that 
offered a bonus were almost as likely to use a disposable bag as in stores that offered 
no  financial  incentive—82  versus  84  percent,  respectively. An  important  concern 
with   cross-sectional  analyses  of  this  type  is  that  differences  in  reusable  bag  use 
between stores may reflect unobserved differences in the stores rather than the bonus 
policy. However, even if one assumes that every customer shopping in a bonus store 
would have used a disposable bag were it not for the policy (and that no customer 
uses a disposable bag if and only if the store offers a bonus), this would suggest that 
the effect of the bonus was still less than half of the effect of the tax.4 Taken together, 
these results are consistent with a model of loss aversion.

While these results are consistent with a model in which customers are  loss-averse, 
there are a number of other reasons why the tax could have been more effective than 
the bonus. I address several competing explanations using survey data from over 
1,600 shoppers collected before and after the implementation of the Montgomery 
County tax. First, I measure whether there are differences in awareness of the two 
policies that could cause the asymmetric response to the incentives. I find that cus-
tomers are much less aware of the bonus than the tax—52 percent of customers are 
aware of the bonus while 98 percent of customers are aware of the tax—likely caus-
ing a substantial portion of the differential response to the two policies. However, 
the differences in awareness cannot fully account for the difference in response to 
the  two  policies:  even  after  adjusting  for   under-awareness  of  the  bonus  policy,  I 
estimate a coefficient of loss aversion that is on the high end of those previously 
found in the literature. Another possibility is that the imposition of the tax shifted 
consumer  attitudes  toward  disposable  bag  use,  whereas  the  bonus  did  not  affect 
consumer attitudes in this way. However, the survey also provides suggestive evi-
dence that customer attitudes toward disposable bag use and pollution regulation 
did not change after the tax was implemented, suggesting that it is unlikely that the 
results are fully explained by a shift in social norms. That being said, I cannot rule 

4 Another concern with the  cross-sectional analysis is that the assignment of customers to stores is  nonrandom. 
As described in more detail below, the most plausible selection stories along these lines would bias my results 
toward finding a larger effect of the bonus.

out that social norms played a contributing role in the relative effectiveness of the 
tax; indeed, the magnitude of the estimated coefficient of loss aversion suggests that 
some other phenomena may also have contributed to the discrepancy between the 
effect of the tax and the effect of the bonus.

This paper is organized as follows. Section I reviews the history of disposable 
bag regulations. Section II presents two models of the customer’s choice to bring a 
reusable bag. Section III describes the data sources used in the empirical analysis. 
Section  IV  presents  estimates  of  the  impact  of  the  tax  and  bonus  policies  in  the 
Washington Metropolitan Area. Section V discusses possible explanations for the 
difference in responses to the two policies. Section VI considers alternative models 
of reference dependence and measures the coefficient of loss aversion. Section VII 
concludes.

I.  Background on Disposable Bag Regulations

Americans consume 100 billion plastic bags each year, with worldwide estimates 
reaching as high as 1.5 trillion (Clapp and Swanston 2009). While these plastic bags 
are  often  recyclable,  the  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA)  estimated  that 
only 5.2 percent of plastic bags in the United States in 2005 were actually recycled 
(USEPA 2007).
In an effort to reduce pollution, policymakers have passed a variety of policies 
to curb disposable bag consumption. Starting in the early 2000s, several countries 
in Europe, Asia, and Africa implemented policies that required retailers to charge 
customers  for  their  plastic  bag  use.5  In  response  to  the  District  Department  of 
the  Environment  report  on  water  pollution  levels  in Washington,  DC (Anacostia 
Watershed  Society    2008),  the Anacostia  River  Cleanup  and  Protection Act  cre-
ated a law that made Washington, DC the first city in the United States to charge a 
fee for the use of disposable bags. As of January 1, 2010, all food retailers in the 
district  were  required  to  charge  $0.05  per   single-use  plastic  or  paper  bag  at  the 
point of purchase.6 Exactly two years later (January 1, 2012), Montgomery County, 
Maryland, which borders Washington, DC to the northwest, enacted a similar  $0.05 
tax on all disposable bags.7 Similar bills have been suggested in other jurisdictions 
in the Washington Metropolitan Area, but none have passed as of the date of this  
study.8

While these policies were two of the first laws in the United States that required 
customers  to  pay  a  tax  for  disposable  bag  use,  they  were  not  the  first  financial 

5 Researchers have evaluated the effects of plastic bag regulations in South Africa (Hasson, Leiman, and Visser 
2007; Dikgang, Leiman, and Visser 2012), Ireland (Convery, McDonnell, and Ferreira 2007), and China (He 2010) 
and find large effects of the policies. However, these policies were implemented countrywide causing these evalua-
tions to suffer from a lack of a counterfactual. 

6 One to two cents of the tax went to the retailer to cover costs associated with the tax’s implementation while 

the remainder entered a fund dedicated to cleaning up the Anacostia River. 

7 Unlike in Washington, DC, the Montgomery County tax applies to all retailers, not just those selling food or 

alcohol. Proceeds from the tax enter the county’s Water Quality Protection Charge. 

8 More recently, jurisdictions in many other parts of the country have passed similar legislation. For example, 
several counties in California charge $0.05 or $0.10 cents for paper bags and ban  single-use plastic bags altogether 
(see Taylor and  Villas-Boas 2016 for a thorough history of the California disposable bag laws).

 incentive policies aimed at discouraging disposable bag use. Prior to the implemen-
tation of either tax, half of the grocery stores in the Washington Metropolitan Area 
with the largest market share offered customers a  $0.05 bonus for each reusable bag 
a customer used in lieu of a new disposable bag. The bonus operated much like the 
tax, but rather than paying $0.05 for each disposable bag, the customers final bill 
was credited $0.05 for each reusable bag the customer used (see Figure 1 for sample 
receipts).

II.  Modeling Responses to Financial Incentives

Consider a customer who is choosing whether to use a disposable or reusable 
bag. Customers have idiosyncratic preferences for bag use and incur a utility cost 
from bringing a reusable bag,   c i    , which can be positive (for example, a psycholog-
ical cost for remembering to bring a bag) or negative (for example, a warm glow 
from helping the environment). For simplicity, customers must use one of the two 
types  of  bags  and  require  only  one  bag.  Let    w i     denote  consumer   i ’s  wealth  and 
let   b i    indicate whether the consumer brings a reusable bag. Assume that utility is 
additively separable between  c  and  w  so that when there is no external incentive, 
utility for consumer  i  can be defined as   U N, i   ( w i  ,  b i   )  =  u( w i   ) −  b i    c i   . Now suppose 
that customers are subject to a tax of magnitude  x  for using a disposable bag. The 
individual’s utility function then becomes   U T, i   ( w i  ,  b i   )  =  u( w i   − (1 −  b i   ) x)  −  b i    c i   .  
Similarly, if we consider a policy where customers receive a bonus of  x  for using a 
reusable bag, the utility function becomes   U B, i   ( w i  ,  b i   )  =  u( w i   +  b i   x) −  b i    c i   .
Consumers will bring a reusable bag when the benefit of doing so exceeds the 
costs:   b i    =  1  ⇔   U i   ( w i  , 1)  ≥   U i   ( w i  , 0) . The table below outlines this condition 
under different policies. If no financial incentives are provided, customers will bring 
a bag if  0  >   c i   , i.e., if they derive a personal benefit from bringing a reusable bag. 
If customers are charged a tax for disposable bag use, they will bring a reusable bag 
if the decrease in utility they suffer from having to pay the tax is larger than the cost 
of bringing a reusable bag. Similarly, if customers are awarded a bonus for reusable

bag use, they will bring a reusable bag if the utility gain from receiving the bonus is 
larger than the cost of bringing a reusable bag.

Should we expect that customers will have the same response to a bonus and a tax 
of the same size? The following section presents two models with different predic-
tions for the relative effectiveness of the tax and bonus policies.

A. Neoclassical Model

In this paper, I consider the effect of tax and bonus policies with a very small  x  , 
i.e., $0.05. Standard economic theory predicts that if   c i    is also very small, a small 
financial incentive could still have a large effect on behavior, i.e., small incentives 
will be effective as long as demand for disposable bags is elastic.
Suppose that customers maximize utility over wealth and that utility is strictly increas-
ing and weakly concave in wealth (  u ′  ( w i  )  >  0  and  u′′( w i  )  ≤  0 ). Then customers will 
derive less utility from a gain in wealth than from a loss of the same magnitude due to the 
curvature of the utility function and the proportion of customers bringing a reusable bag 
will be larger under the tax policy than under the bonus policy. However, Rabin (2000) 
demonstrates that individuals must be approximately risk-neutral over small stakes in 
order for expected-utility models to imply reasonable levels of risk aversion over large 
stakes. His calibrations suggest that the consumption value of a dollar should not change 
significantly over changes in wealth up to $1,000. Given that the incentives considered 
in this study are only $0.05 per bag, it is reasonable to assume that utility is linear, i.e.,  
 u( w i  )  =  γ  w i   , over the change in wealth caused by these incentive policies. With this 
assumption, the conditions under which customers would bring a reusable bag under 
the tax policy and under the bonus policy are exactly the same (see table below).

B.  Reference-Dependent Model

Prospect  theory,  developed  by  Kahneman  and  Tversky (1979),  proposes  that, 
while utility is defined in terms of net wealth, value is defined in terms of deviations 
from a reference point (i.e., gains and losses). This model suggest that individuals 
perceive losses more strongly than gains of the same size, a phenomenon referred 
to as loss aversion. Consider a simple  reference-dependent utility function where 
utility is linear in wealth but with a kink at a reference point,   w   ∗  :

 

 u( w i  )  =   { γ( w i   −  w   ∗ )  
αγ( w i   −  w   ∗ )  

 

if   w i    >   w   ∗ 
   ,  where α > 1. 
  
if  w i    ≤   w   ∗ 

 

If an individual’s reference point is his wealth level in the absence of any incen-
tive policy, then the conditions for using a reusable bag simplify to the equations in 
the following table.

 0  >   c i

Since  α  >  1  , this model predicts that customers are more likely to bring a reus-
able bag when the financial incentive takes the form of a tax rather than a bonus. 
The following sections empirically test whether customers respond similarly to the 
two policies, as predicted by neoclassical theory, or if customers exhibit behavior 
consistent with a model of loss aversion.

III.  Data

To assesses the relative effectiveness of the tax and bonus policies, I use a unique 
dataset on bag use in the Washington Metropolitan Area around the implementation 
of  the  Montgomery  County,  Maryland  tax. To  collect  the  data,  researchers  stood 
by the exit of a grocery store and recorded  individual-level data on the number and 
type of bags each customer used,9 as well as  visually-assessable demographic char-
acteristics, such as sex and race, of all customers exiting the store during the sample 

9 A disposable bag refers to either paper or plastic  single-use bags. I do not consider the two types of bags 
 separately because almost all customers chose to use plastic bags when they were offered. A reusable bag refers 
to any  multiple-use bag. While most customers used standard reusable bags sold by the store, this category also 
includes shopping carts, backpacks, tote bags, or disposable bags brought from home.

period. Researchers visited a given store in 30 minute shifts, randomizing the time 
and location of the visit. The visits took place between eleven in the morning and 
eight at night during weekdays only. Each store received an average of nine visits 
for a final sample of 16,251 individual customers.

The  sample  period  began  approximately  three  months  before  and  ended  three 
months after the implementation of the tax on January 1, 2012.10 The sample includes 
data on bag use from 16 stores, spanning 3 different counties, each with a different tax 
policy regime. Eight stores were located in Montgomery County, Maryland (where 
there was a tax policy change during the sample period), four stores in Washington, 
DC (which  implemented  a  tax  two  years  before  data  collection  began),  and  four 
stores in Arlington County, Virginia (which had proposed a bag tax, but never passed 
one). See Figure 2, panel A for a map of sample stores by county.
The sample stores in this dataset vary not only in whether they charge customers a 
tax for disposable bag use, but also whether they reward customers for reusable bag 
use. The 16 stores belong to 4 of the largest chains in the Washington Metropolitan 
Area, 2 of which offer $0.05 bonuses for reusable bag use both before and after the 
implementation of the Montgomery County tax. These stores were chosen to be com-
parable on all aspects other than bag policy. Comparability is particularly important 
when estimating the effect of the bonus since, unlike with the tax policy, the bonus 
policy had been implemented prior to any data collection, so analyses estimating 
the effect of the bonus rely on  cross-sectional variation in store policy. First, all four 
chains had locations in the three counties considered in this sample. Second, sample 
stores were drawn from neighborhoods with similar demographic characteristics.11 
In fact, most sample stores that offered a bonus were located within a  ten-minute 
walk from a sample store that did not offer a bonus (see Figure 2, panel B for a map 
of stores by bonus policy). Third, since customers who drive to the grocery store 
may differ from customers who use public transportation, all sample stores had a 
parking lot and were also accessible by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit 
Authority’s  Metrorail.  Fourth,  the  stores  were  roughly  the  same  size  containing 
between 15 and 25 lanes. Fifth, all stores sold reusable bags by the checkout counter 
as well as in other locations throughout the store. Lastly, one of the sample chains 
that offers a bonus is an organic food chain. Since customers shopping at organic 
food chains may differ in their reusable bag use, the four sample stores belonging to 
this chain are dropped from certain analyses. Of the 12 stores remaining stores, half 
offer a  $0.05 bonus per reusable bag and half do not. See Table 1 for a list of store 
and customer characteristics by store.

10 Data  in  the   pre-period  was  collected  from  late  September  to  early  November  of  2011,  while  data  in  the 

 post-period was collected from late February to early March of 2012. 

11 Since the main policy change considered in this paper took place in Montgomery County, an affluent county 
with a low proportion of racial minorities, stores were selected to match these demographic characteristics. The 
Montgomery County sample stores are located in the cities of Chevy Chase, Bethesda, and Silver Spring, while the 
Arlington County stores are located in the city of Arlington. These cities border Washington, DC and are popular 
communities for those employed in the district. While the city of Washington, DC is more racially and economi-
cally diverse than these suburban commuter cities, the Washington, DC stores selected for this study are located in 
the northwest quadrant of Washington, DC, an affluent area of the city, in order to maintain comparability to the 
samples from Maryland and Virginia.

Observations
Note:  The  table  reports  the  number  of  observations  per  store,  store  location (Washington,  DC,  Maryland,  or 
Virginia), the date the store implemented a $0.05 tax per disposable bag, whether the store offered a $0.05 bonus 
per reusable bag, whether the store belonged to an organic market chain, and the fraction of sample members who 
were female and white, respectively.

I use two survey datasets to investigate various mechanisms that may have led 
to differential responses to the two policies. First, I collected  in-person surveys of 
 customers as they exited the store after their shopping trip.12 These surveys were 
conducted at 12 different locations at two grocery store chains in Maryland, Virginia, 

12 Researchers approached customers as they exited the store between the hours of noon and six and asked if 
they would be willing to participate in a short survey for a research project on shopping behavior. If a customer 
chose not to participate in the survey, the researcher recorded her as a  nonrespondent and moved on to the next 
customer who exited the store.

and Washington, DC shortly before and after the implementation of the Montgomery 
County tax.13 Data collection took place during September and October of 2011 and 
March of 2012. The survey yielded a response rate of 56 percent for a total of 1,496 
respondents. Respondents completed a  two-minute survey that contained questions 
on how many disposable and reusable bags they used during their shopping trip, 
awareness of the bonus and tax policies, measures of how much they believed each 
of these policies did or would encourage them to use a reusable bag, attitudes toward 
plastic  bag  use,  environmentalism,  and  government  regulation  of  pollution,  and 
personal demographic characteristics. In order to test customers’ response to other 
hypothetical disposable bag regulations, I use data from an online survey adminis-
tered through Amazons Mechanical Turk (Mturk), a  crowd-sourcing web service.14
Lastly, I use  transaction-level scanner data from a large retail chain of grocery 
stores to measure the  long-term impact of the tax policy on disposable bag use. The 
dataset includes a 10 percent sample of all transactions from 11 stores in Washington, 
DC and 16 stores in Montgomery County in the time period following the imple-
mentation of the disposable bag tax in each area. The dataset includes transactions 
from January 1, 2010 (the first day of the Washington, DC tax) to June 30, 2012. 
The total sample includes an average between 2,000 and 2,500 transactions per day 
for each of the two counties. Each transaction includes information on the products 
purchased, date, and store location. In addition, the data includes a line item indicat-
ing if a customer was charged a tax for using a disposable bag.

IV.  The Relative Effectiveness of the Tax and Bonus Policies

A. Tax Policy

As mentioned in the previous section, the primary dataset contains  individual-level 
data on bag use before and after the Montgomery County tax was implemented in 
sixteen stores across Montgomery County and two control counties: Washington, 
DC, which implemented a similar tax two years prior to the Montgomery County 
tax, and Arlington County, which proposed a similar tax, but had not passed the tax. 
Table 1 contains the mean values of the demographic characteristics of customers 
in the sample by store. While the three counties vary slightly in their racial com-
position, all three areas are predominantly white, with a similar fraction of female 
customers. In addition, the demographic composition of shoppers is similar across 
the two time periods.15

Figure 3 presents data on bag use in each of the three counties before and after 
the Montgomery County tax was implemented. While reusable bags are the most 

13 The retail chains are a subset of the chains visited in the main analysis due to store manager cooperation. Many 
of the same stores visited when collecting the observational data were also used in the survey sample. Researchers 
collected data at 10 of the 12 stores in both the pre- and  post-period; however, two stores were only visited during 
one of the two time periods. Exclusion of these two stores does not change the results shown in Section V. 
14 While  Mturk  participants  tend  to  be  younger  and  more  educated  than  the  general  population,  Paolacci, 
Chandler, and Ipeirotis (2010) shows that the sample population is generally representative of the US population 
and  they  are  able  to  replicate  the  findings  of  several   well-known  behavioral  economics  experiments  using  this 
subject pool.

 common substitute for disposable bags, customers may opt to not use any bags at 
all; therefore, the majority of the analyses presented in this paper will include mea-
sures of demand for both disposable and reusable bags to create a complete picture 
of the changes in behavior as a result of the bag regulations.

Figure 3, panels A and B show the percent of customers using any disposable 
and any reusable bags, respectively. In the  pre-period, customers in the Arlington 
County sample used at least one disposable bag 82 percent of the time while custom-
ers in Washington, DC used a disposable bag only 45 percent of the time. Similarly, 
Arlington County customers rarely brought a reusable bag when shopping, only 16 
percent of the time, compared to 46 percent in Washington, DC. Bag use was very 
stable across the two periods in each of these control counties. In contrast, bag use 
in Montgomery County changed dramatically after the implementation of the tax. 
Behavior  in  Montgomery  County  during  the   pre-period  resembled  that  observed 
in Arlington  County,  which  had  no  tax  policy—82  percent  of  customers  used  at 
least one disposable bag, while only 16 percent brought a reusable bag. However,

behavior in Montgomery County in the  post-period mirrored the behavior observed 
in Washington, DC, which did have a tax  policy—40 percent of customers used a 
disposable bag while 49 percent brought a reusable bag.

Table 2 contains the statistics corresponding to those displayed in the figures as 
well as means for additional measures of bag use: demand for the two types of bags 
on the extensive margin (the percent of customers using each type of bag or no bags 
at all), the intensive margin (how many bags each customer uses given that she uses 
that particular type of bag), and overall demand (the unconditional number of bags 
of each type the customer uses). While the effect of the tax seems to be operating 
primarily through changes in bag use on the extensive margin, customers who con-
tinue to use disposable bags after the tax use fewer bags per trip. The data also show 
an increase in the proportion of customers choosing not to use any bags at all.

The  following  model  uses  a   difference-in-differences  strategy  to  evaluate  the 
effect of the Montgomery County tax on bag use controlling for various individual 
characteristics and  location-level controls:

 

  Y isdt    =  α + βMD×Pos t st   + γPos t t   + η  Z s   + λ  X i   + δ Q d   +  ε isdt   ;

implementation of the Montgomery County tax,  MD×Post  is an indicator for cus-
tomers shopping in Montgomery County in the post period,  Z  is a set of  store-level

i  shopping in location  s  during time of day  d  at time period  t .16 The coefficient of 
interest is  β  , which measures the effect of the tax on bag use in Montgomery County 
relative to changes in use in the control stores. Standard errors are clustered at the 
store level to allow for correlation within store across time.17

Table 3 presents results for the effect of the tax on demand for disposable bags on 
the extensive margin using different control variables in each specification.18 The 
model in column 1 controls only for time period, state, and an indicator for shopping 
in Montgomery County in the  post-period. The results show that the tax caused a 
decrease in the proportion of customers using at least one disposable bag by 41.7 
percentage points. Column 2 adds controls for the available  individual-level demo-
graphic characteristics, race and sex. If certain demographic groups are more likely 
to use reusable bags instead of disposable bags, differences in demographics across 
locations and time periods could bias these results. While  nonwhite and male cus-
tomers are more likely to use a disposable bag in general, the estimate of the effect 

16 Time of day is separated into three categories: 11 am to 1:30 pm (“Morning”), 2 pm to 4:30 pm (“Afternoon”), 
and 5 am to 8 pm (“Evening”). 
17 Because the dataset contains data on only 16 stores, clustering at the store level could yield poor approxima-
tions of the true standard errors. As a robustness check, I also calculate  wild-bootstrap  p-values following Cameron, 
Gelbach, and Miller (2008). Accounting for the  small-cluster problem does not change any of the qualitative results 
in the paper. 
18 Regressions presented in this table use a linear probability model to estimate the change in demand. A Probit 

model yields similar results.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the store level are in parentheses. Outcome variables: indicator for using at least 
one bag or no bags (extensive) and number of bags used among users (intensive) for disposable and reusable bags, 
respectively. All regressions control for individual demographics (race and sex), time-of-day fixed effects, and store 
fixed effects.

of the tax is unchanged by the inclusion of these controls. Column 3 adds controls 
for time of day, since the behavior or composition of customers may vary through-
out the day. Again, the estimates are largely unchanged. Finally, column 4 includes 
store fixed effects. As with the other controls, the addition of  store-level fixed effects 
has little impact on the estimated effect of the tax.

Table 4 repeats the analysis for the other measures of bag use using the specifica-
tion from column 4 in Table 3. The outcomes in the first three columns are measures 
of disposable and reusable bag use on the extensive margin, respectively, as well as 
a binary measure for using no bags of either type. These results show that the tax 
led to a decrease in disposable bag use of 42.0 percentage points and an increase 
in reusable bag use of 32.7 percentage points. In addition, the percent of customers 
who used no bags at all increased by 11.1 percentage points.19,20 On the intensive 
margin, I observe smaller, but still statistically significant, effects on bag consump-
tion—the number of bags used by disposable bag users decreased by 0.22 bags and 
the number of bags used by reusable bag users increased by 0.15 bags, a change of 
approximately 8 and 9 percent, respectively.21

19 A small fraction of customers used both reusable and disposable bags, which explains why the increase in 
reusable bag use and customers choosing not to use any bags is not completely offset by the decrease in plastic bag 
use on the extensive margin. 
20 These  results  are  very  similar  to  results  found  in  Taylor  and  Villas-Boas (2016)  who  examine  a  policy  in 
Richmond, California that bans  single-use plastic bags and charges $0.05 for paper bags, as well as a study conducted 
by the Chicago Mayor’s office that evaluates a 2017 tax of $0.07 on all disposable bags. These studies find that dis-
posable bag use decreases by 35 and 33 percentage points, respectively, shortly after the implementation of the policy. 
21 It is important to note that 10 of the 16 stores included in this analysis had a bonus policy in place during the 
time of the implementation of the tax. Stores that offered a bonus did so in the pre- and  post-period and are located

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the store level are in parentheses. Outcome variable: number 
of disposable or reusable bags used. Columns 1 and 2 consider a linear demand model, while 
columns 3 and 4 use a double-hurdle model following McDonald and Moffitt (1980). All regres-
sions control for individual demographics (race and sex), time-of-day fixed effects, and store 
fixed effects.

Table 5 considers two different models that estimate the overall effect of the tax 
on demand. Columns 1 and 2 present results from a simple linear demand model 
where the outcome of interest is the total number of bags used. The results show 
that the tax reduced the number of disposable bags used by just over one bag per 
shopping trip, cutting the average number of disposable bags used roughly in half. 
Columns 3 and 4 use an alternative demand model, a “ double-hurdle” model, that 
combines demand on the extensive and intensive margins to estimate the impact on 
overall demand (McDonald and Moffitt 1980). I decompose the conditional expec-
tation of demand into its extensive and intensive components:
 E [ y | x ]   =  E [ y | x, y  >  0 ]  × Pr(y  >  0 | x), 

 

where  y  represents  demand  and  x  represents  the  covariates. The  total  effect  of  a 
change in one of the covariates on demand is given by

   ∂ E [ y | x] _ 

 

   =    ∂ E [ y | x, y  >  0]

in all three counties (see Table 1). To study whether the effect of the tax is different in stores that offer a bonus and 
those that do not, the Appendix repeats the analysis in Table 4 including an interaction term for whether a store 
offers a bonus or not. Results show that the tax had a similar impact on disposable bag use in both types of stores, 
but that customers in bonus stores were more likely to switch to reusable bag use than to opt to use no bags at all. 

HOMONOFF: CAN SMALL INCENTIVES HAVE LARGE EFFECTS?192 

AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY 

NOVEMBER 2018

Estimates of  Pr(y  >  0 | x)  and  E [ y | x, y  >  0]  come from the data with each eval-
uated at the sample mean the covariates and are combined with the extensive and 
intensive  margin  regression  coefficients  in  Table  4  to  generate  a  rough  estimate 
of the overall effect of the taxes on demand.22 The estimates suggest that the tax 
decreased the number of disposable bags used by 1.26 bags and increased the num-
ber of reusable bags used by 0.62 bags per customer per shopping trip. These results 
are qualitatively similar to the results from the linear demand model presented in 
columns 1 and 2.

One concern with the analyses presented in this section is that the composition 
of customers shopping at a given store may have changed as a result of the tax. For 
example, shoppers in Montgomery County may try to avoid paying the tax by shop-
ping in a different county after the policy was implemented. Scanner data from one 
large retail chain suggests that this is not the case: the number of daily transactions 
in a given store (as well as several measures of purchasing behavior, such as basket 
size) did not change after the tax was implemented. See the Appendix for a detailed 
analysis.

B. Bonus Policy

This section compares the behavior of customers at stores with different incentive 
policies. Each sample store falls into one of four policy types. The first type of store 
provides no incentives for reducing the use of disposable bags. These are grocery 
store chains that do not offer a bonus and were not required to charge a tax. The sec-
ond type of store offers a bonus for reusable bag use, but does not charge a tax for 
disposable bag use. The third type of store does not offer a bonus, but does charge 
a tax. Finally, the last group of stores both offers a bonus for reusable bag use and 
charges a tax for disposable bag use, since all of the stores in the sample that pro-
vided a bonus prior to the tax continued to provide a bonus after the tax was imple-
mented. Again, if disposable bags and reusable bags are substitutes,  bonus-only and 
 tax-only  stores  offer  customers  a   $0.05  incentive  for  using  a  reusable  bag  while 
 bonus-plus-tax stores offer customers a $0.10 incentive for the same behavior.

As  mentioned  in  Section  III,  the  bonus  policy  was  implemented  prior  to  data 
collection,  so  the  estimation  of  the  impact  of  the  bonus  on  bag  use  relies  on 
 cross-sectional variation in whether a store chose to offer a bonus for reusable bag 
use. While the differences in bag use across stores with different incentives may 
reflect omitted  store-level characteristics, these comparisons can still be informative 
if the customers shopping at bonus and  non-bonus stores are similar in terms of their 
shopping behavior.

A few pieces of evidence suggest comparability of customers across the various 
store types. As mentioned in Section III, the sample stores were drawn from the larg-
est four chains in the Washington Metropolitan Area, each of which had locations 
in all three counties considered in this study. Additionally, all sample stores had a 
parking lot, were accessible by public transportation, and had a similar number of

checkout lanes (between 15 and 25 lanes). Bonus and  non-bonus stores were located 
within the same neighborhoods, with most bonus stores located within walking dis-
tance of a  non-bonus store in the sample (see Figure 2, panel B). As a result, cus-
tomers in the two types of stores had very similar demographic characteristics (see 
Table 6). Lastly, this analysis excludes observations from the one organic chain that 
provided a bonus, since reusable bag use among these customers may not be compa-
rable due to the  environmentally-conscious reputation of the company.23

Figure 4, panels A and B show the fraction of customers using at least one dispos-
able bag or at least one reusable bag, respectively, by policy type with each bar repre-
senting a  policy-location-period. For example, bonus stores in Montgomery County 
are included in the  bonus-only category in the  pre-period and in the  bonus-plus-tax 
category  in  the   post-period.  In  Figure  4,  panel A,  an  average  of  84.3  percent  of 
customers use at least one disposable bag in stores with no incentive policy. This 
estimate is much higher than that in stores with both a tax and a bonus—only 40.4 
percent of customers used a disposable bag in these stores.

What is most striking, however, is the comparison of stores that offer only a  $0.05 
incentive but that differ in whether the incentive takes the form of a tax or a bonus. 
Customers in stores with only a tax used a disposable bag 40.8 percent of the time, 
similar to customers in stores offering both a tax and a bonus. However, customers 
in stores that offered only a bonus used a disposable bag 81.9 percent of the time. 
This estimate is much closer to the percent of customers using a disposable bag in 
stores that provided no incentive than it is to stores offering an incentive of the same 
amount, but in the form of a tax instead of a bonus.

Figure 4, panel B tells a similar story for the proportion of customers using a 
reusable  bag.  Customers  shopping  in  stores  with  both  a  bonus  and  a  tax  used  a 
reusable bag 47.8 percent of the time, which is similar to, though statistically sig-
nificantly  larger  than,  the  44.2  percent  of  customers  who  used  a  reusable  bag  in 
stores that charge a tax but do not provide a bonus. However, only 15.4 percent of 
 customers brought a reusable bag in stores that offer a bonus only. This estimate is 

23 Reusable bag use in these stores is slightly higher than in the  nonorganic stores; however, inclusion of these 

stores leaves the results in this section qualitatively unchanged.

much smaller than that in stores that charge a tax, though only slightly larger than 
the 13.1 percent of customers who shop at stores with no incentive policies.

While effort was taken to choose stores that had similar characteristics, unob-
served differences between bonus and  non-bonus stores may bias these results. To 
investigate  the  potential  magnitude  of  this  bias,  suppose  that,  were  it  not  for  the 
bonus,  none  of  the  customers  shopping  in   bonus-only  stores  would  have  used  a 
reusable bag. Note that this assumption provides an  upper-bound for the effect of 
the bonus: at most, the bonus increased reusable bag use from 0 to 15.4 percent.24 
If I compare this  upper-bound estimate to the estimate of the effect of the tax policy 

24 This statement also requires the plausible assumption that no customer uses a disposable bag if and only if the 

store offers a bonus for reusable bag use.

found in Section IVA, the impact of the tax (32.7 percentage points) was still more 
than twice as large as the impact of the bonus. Therefore, while the comparison of 
bag use in Figure 4, panels A and B, is purely  cross-sectional, this example shows 
that even with extreme selection of customers across stores, it is reasonable to con-
clude that a  $0.05 tax is considerably more effective at increasing reusable bag use 
than a bonus of the same amount.25

The comparison of bag use by store policy can be repeated using the following 
econometric model that controls for factors that might confound the simple compar-
ison of means:

 

  Y isdt    =  α + βTa x st   + γBonu s s   + η  Z s   + λ  X i   + δ  Q d   +  ε isdt    ;

 Y  is a measure of bag demand,  Tax  is an indicator for whether a store charges a  $0.05 
tax,  Bonus  is an indicator for whether the store offers a  $0.05  bonus for reusable bag 
use,  Z  is a set of  state-level controls, and  X  is a set of  individual-level demographic 
characteristics for individual  i  shopping in state  s  during time of day  d  at time period  
t . If I assume that, conditional on these controls, there are no unobservable differ-
ences between the customers of bonus and  non-bonus stores that would affect their 
response to the two types of incentives, or to their demand in the absence of a bag 
regulation, then  β  is the effect of the tax policy and  γ  is the effect of the bonus policy.
Table 7 presents the results for disposable and reusable bag use on the extensive 
margin. Columns 2 and 4 control for demographic characteristics and time of day 
while columns 1 and 3 do not. As with the evaluation of the tax policy in Table 3, 
the inclusion of these controls does not change the estimates of the effect of the 
tax  or  bonus  policies.  Customers  are  significantly  less  likely  to  use  a  disposable 
bag in stores that charge a tax—44.5 percentage points lower—whereas customers 
shopping at stores that offer a bonus program do not differ significantly from those 
shopping  at  stores  without  the  program.  While  customers  are  significantly  more 
likely to use a reusable bag in both tax and bonus stores than in stores that offered 
no incentive, the magnitude of difference is much larger in tax stores than in bonus 
stores—32.7 versus 2.9 percentage points.26,27 While, to my knowledge, no other 
studies rigorously test the effect of a reusable bag bonus, these null results are in line 
with anecdotal evidence on the ineffectiveness of reusable bag bonuses. For exam-
ple, Kroger, the largest grocery chain in the United States, discontinued policies that 
offered bonuses for reusable bag use in 2011 citing that “the company has found no 

25 In fact, one of the more plausible scenarios for selection of customers across stores with different policies is 
that customers who would choose to bring a reusable bag in the absence of any incentive policy might choose to 
shop at stores that reward them for doing so. However, this pattern would suggest I am overestimating the causal 
impact of the bonus policy due to selection. 

26 In order to test for possible  nonlinearities in the effect of the incentives, I include a term for the interaction of 
the two policies. This term is positive and significant, though small in magnitude, for reusable bag use and insignif-
icant for disposable bag use. This suggests that increasing the total economic incentive to $0.10 has little effect on 
behavior, at least when the additional incentive is framed as a bonus. 

27 In an effort to avoid issues of comparability across stores with different policies, the Appendix includes an 
additional analysis on how participants of the survey mentioned in Section III reported that they would respond to a 
hypothetical  $0.05 tax or bonus policy. Nineteen percent of respondents said that a bonus would definitely influence 
their decision to use a reusable bag. This estimate increased by 29 percentage points when the hypothetical policy 
was a tax instead of a bonus.

V.  Reasons for Asymmetric Responses to Taxes and Bonuses

A. Loss Aversion

As mentioned in Section II, standard economic models suggest that the tax and 
bonus policies should have the same effect on behavior; however, Kahneman and 
Tversky (1979) suggest that if individuals are  loss-averse, they will respond more 
to a policy in which the incentive is framed as a loss than a gain, even when the 
incentives are the same financial amount. In the context of this paper, if a customer 
is accustomed to receiving a disposable bag for free (i.e., her reference point is a 
price of zero), then a policy that charges customers $0.05  per disposable bag causes 
her to experience a loss, while a policy that offers a $0.05 bonus per reusable bag is 
considered to be a gain.
Recent evidence from the field supports this theory in a wide variety of contexts 
including decisions involving labor supply (Camerer et al. 1997; Oettinger 1999), 

VOL. 10 NO. 4 

197

tax compliance ( Rees-Jones 2018; Engström et al. 2015), sports performance (Allen 
et al. 2017; Pope and Schweitzer 2011), and trading (Odean 1998; Genesove and 
Mayer 2001), to name a few. A second set of papers most related to this study uses 
 gain-loss framing as a policy tool to nudge people toward a desirable behavior. For 
example,  Fryer  et  al. (2012)  finds  that  framing   pay-for-performance  bonuses  for 
public school teachers as a loss (providing all teachers with a bonus upfront, but 
rescinding it if their students  under-performed) is more effective at increasing test 
scores than a traditional bonus framed as a gain. Hossain and List (2012) and Field 
(2009) use a similar experimental design and find evidence of loss aversion in the 
context of productivity bonuses for factory workers and tuition subsidies for law 
students entering public interest careers, respectively.

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  incentives  considered  in  the  studies  above  that 
use loss aversion in a more prescriptive way are quite large—several thousands of 
dollars per year. While the theoretical literature on loss aversion does not suggest 
that the  gain-loss asymmetry should fade as the size of the incentive decreases, a 
second  line  of  literature  from  behavioral  economics  suggests  that  small  financial 
incentives for pro-social behavior can actually be demotivating since the extrinsic 
motivation (i.e., the financial incentive) crowds out an individual’s intrinsic moti-
vation for pro-social behavior. Several studies show that providing small financial 
incentives for pro-social behavior actually decrease the desired behavior (Gneezy 
and Rustichini 2000a, b; Gneezy, Meier, and  Rey-Biel 2011).
To my knowledge, this is the first study to test the effectiveness of nudges that use 
loss aversion as a policy tool when the incentives are very small. One exception is 
Levitt et al. (2016), which provides small  pay-for-performance incentives (between 
$10 and $20) to students for standardized test performance, varying the  gain-loss 
framing of the incentive as in the studies above and finds that incentives framed as 
a loss are more effective; however, while small in magnitude, these incentives may 
actually be quite large for the relevant population. The results presented in this paper 
are also consistent with a model in which customers are loss averse even when the 
incentives are very small—the tax policy is more effective at reducing disposable 
bag  use  than  the  bonus  policy—and  show  no  evidence  of  crowd  out  of  intrinsic 
motivation.

B. Marketing and Awareness

One crucial concern with interpreting the results from Section IV as evidence of 
loss aversion is that awareness of the two policies may differ. For example, the tax 
was covered widely in the press in the weeks leading up to its implementation. In 
spite of the fact that all sample stores marketed the two types of incentives in similar 
ways (e.g., both bonus and tax policies were advertised in announcements posted at 
the register and other locations throughout the store), it is likely that the additional 
marketing involved with the implementation of the tax may have generated a differ-
ence in awareness of the two policies.

To  estimate  these  discrepancies  in  awareness,  I  surveyed  customers  at  sample 
stores  about  their  knowledge  of  the  store’s  tax  and  bonus  policies. While  almost 
all  customers (98  percent)  were  aware  of  the  tax,  only  about  half (52  percent) 

HOMONOFF: CAN SMALL INCENTIVES HAVE LARGE EFFECTS?198 

AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY 

NOVEMBER 2018

of   customers  in  stores  that  offered  a  bonus  were  aware  of  that  program.  This 
 under-awareness of the bonus policy could mute the estimate of the effect of the 
incentive  relative  to  the  tax.  In  order  to  account  for  the  relative  unawareness  of 
the bonus, I rescale the estimate of the effect of the bonus policy from Table 7 by 
dividing the estimate by the fraction of customers who were aware of the policy.28 
However, even after rescaling, the effect of the tax on the proportion of customers 
using a reusable bag was still much larger than the effect of the bonus—33.4 ver-
sus 5.6 percentage points.29 In fact, in order for differences in awareness to fully 
account for the relative effectiveness of the two policies, no more than 9 percent 
of customers who would have switched from disposable to reusable bags had they 
known about the bonus could have actually been aware of the policy. So while it is 
clear that substantial differences in awareness contributed to the relative effective-
ness of the tax policy, this cannot completely account for the observed asymmetry 
in responses to the two policies.

C. Social Norms

Another  possibility  is  that  the  two  policies  led  to  differential  shifts  in  social 
norms. For example, since the tax was a law while the bonus was simply a store 
policy, shoppers may interpret the tax policy as a statement about what behavior 
warrants punishment, a legal theory known as the “expressive function of law.”30

It is difficult to rule out the hypothesis that the tax caused a shift in social norms, 
largely because social norms are difficult to measure. Nonetheless, I collected  survey 
measures of attitudes toward disposable bag use at seven grocery stores before and 
after the implementation of the Montgomery County bag tax. This allows me to use 
the same  difference-in-differences strategy as described in Section IVA to evaluate 
the effect of the implementation of the tax on these  self-reported social norms mea-
sures.31 Table 8 presents the results of this analysis. While the standard errors are 
rather large, none of the measures show a significant change after the tax was imple-
mented; in fact, the signs of the different measures are not even in the same direc-
tion—for  example,  the  percent  of  customers  reporting  that  they  felt  guilty  when 
using a plastic bag increased after the implementation of the tax, while the percent 
reporting that they felt social pressure to use fewer plastic bags decreased. While 
these results are by no means conclusive, they provide suggestive evidence that the 
implementation of the law did not cause a detectable shift in  self-reported social 
norms regarding the use of disposable bags.

28 Note that this method assumes that customers who were unaware of the bonus policy would have responded 

to the policy in the same way as those who were aware of the policy had they known about the bonus. 

29 A  slightly  more  conservative  estimate  assumes  that  customers  who  would  respond  to  the  bonus  policy  if 
they were aware of it have an awareness rate equal to that of survey participants who did not use a reusable bag on 
the day of the survey—38.0 percent. This would imply that the bonus led to an increase in reusable bag use of 7.6 
percentage points, still dramatically lower than the effect of the tax. 
30 For example, Funk (2007) shows that voter turnout in Switzerland decreased significantly after a mandatory 
voting law with negligible penalties (less than one dollar) was repealed. 
31 Customers  were  asked  if  they  felt  guilty  when  they  used  a  disposable  bag (“Guilt”),  felt  social  pressure 
to  use  fewer  disposable  bags (“Pressure”),  got  upset  when  they  saw  other  customers  use  too  many  disposable 
bags (“Upset”), thought the number of disposable bags they used was wasteful (“Wasteful”), and whether they  
would support a law that required stores to tax customers $0.05 for each disposable bag (“Support”).

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the store level are in parentheses. Outcome variable: indicator for responding 
affirmatively to the given social norms survey question. Respondents were asked if they felt guilty when they used 
a disposable bag (“Guilt”), felt social pressure to use fewer disposable bags (“Pressure”), got upset when they saw 
other customers use too many disposable bags (“Upset”), thought the number of disposable bags they used was 
wasteful (“Wasteful”), and whether they would support a law that required stores to tax customers $0.05 for each 
disposable bag (“Support”). All regressions control for store county and respondent characteristics including sex, 
race, age, education, and income.

One additional point to note is that the Montgomery County tax was implemented 
on January 1, 2012, but was passed in May of 2011. The change in behavior esti-
mated in this paper is measured at the law’s implementation. Survey data from the 
 pretax  period  suggests  that  just  over  half  of  survey  respondents  in  Montgomery 
County were aware that the law had been approved and that they would soon be 
charged $0.05 per disposable bag. Additionally, the Montgomery County tax was 
not the first tax of its kind in the Washington Metropolitan Area: DC passed a similar 
tax two years prior. Given that the sample draws from stores in areas that are close to 
DC, it is likely that many of the customers in the sample had been exposed to the DC 
bag tax prior to the implementation of the Montgomery County tax. The survey data 
shows that 73.7 percent of respondents in Virginia and 83.7 percent of Montgomery 
County respondents were aware of the DC tax.32 This suggests that any change in 
social norms among customers shopping at a given store would have needed to take 

32 This question was only asked in the  post-period. While this should not affect the validity of the responses 
from Virginia, the Montgomery County results may be biased upward since they may have learned about the DC 
tax only after the implementation of the Montgomery County tax.

place only when the tax was implemented in that store’s county rather than at the 
passage of the law or the implementation of similar laws in neighboring counties.

D. Utility from Free Goods

Shampanier,  Mazar,  and  Ariely  (2007)  present  an  alternative  model  of 
 reference-dependent preferences in which the benefits derived from receiving a free 
product are larger than the simple reduction in price. For example, individuals may 
receive higher intrinsic benefit from receiving free goods or, conversely, may expe-
rience lower utility costs from not having to pay for a  non-free good. Note that this 
model is a specific case of  reference-dependent preferences in which customers only 
exhibit reference dependence when the reference point in question is a customer’s 
wealth when a good is free. Additionally, their model suggests that there is a dis-
continuous jump in utility at this  zero-price reference point rather than a kink. This 
would imply that a customer’s utility should decrease discretely when a store policy 
shifts from offering no incentive to charging a tax (i.e., when the good is no longer 
free) by some amount  δ :
 

  

 u( w i   )  =   { γ  w i  

γ  w i   − δ  

if  w i    ≥   w   ∗ 
   
if   w i    <   w   ∗ 

  ,  where δ > 0. 

Since the reference point considered in this paper is a customer’s wealth when dis-
posable bags are free, this  model could also explain  the results from Section  IV. 
While my data cannot distinguish between this specific case of  reference-dependent 
preferences or the more general model described in Section IIB, nor can it determine 
whether the change in utility is a kink versus a discontinuous jump, it rejects any 
model that does not predict asymmetry around this particular reference point.

E. Additional Explanations

There are several other possible explanations that may contribute to the difference 
in responses to the two incentive policies. For example, while both policies offer a 
 $0.05 incentive per bag for those who use a reusable bag instead of a disposable bag, 
the incentives are not symmetric for individuals who choose to use no bag—cus-
tomers who change their behavior from using a disposable bag to using no bags are 
$0.05 richer under the tax policy, but are financially unchanged under the bonus pol-
icy. However, the large majority of customers in the sample use one of the two types 
of bags rather than carrying their groceries in their arms. Similarly, if reusable bags 
are larger than disposable bags, the tax policy provides a larger incentive than the 
bonus policy. As with the asymmetries in awareness in Section VB, the difference in 
the size of the two types of bags would need to be substantial—reusable bags would 
need to be roughly ten times as large as a disposable bag—to generate the results 
found in Section IV. Another concern is that the behavior of the cashiers may have 
changed after the tax was implemented, either in how they bagged the groceries or 
how they reminded customers of the tax policy. While I cannot rule out this mech-
anism, I did not observe this type of behavior while collecting data at the sample

stores. Lastly, recent work by Li, Linn, and Muehlegger (2014) and Sussman and 
Olivola (2011) present evidence that consumers are “ tax-averse,” which suggests 
that customers may respond more strongly to the tax simply because it is labeled 
as a tax and not a fee. While there were no existing policies that charged a fee for 
disposable bag use that is not framed as a tax in the sample stores, the Appendix 
presents  evidence  from  an  online  experiment  that  elicited  participants’  responses 
to a hypothetical  store-imposed fee versus a  government-imposed tax and finds no 
differences in responses to the two policies.

VI.  Estimating Loss Aversion

A. The Coefficient of Loss Aversion

As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  there  are  several  explanations  for  the 
asymmetric response to the two incentive policies observed in the data. This section 
accounts for the differences in policy awareness from Section VB then uses esti-
mates from Section IV to measure the degree of loss aversion in the population if 
the remaining asymmetry in responses to the tax and bonus policies were attributed 
to  loss  aversion.  In  the   reference-dependent  utility  function  described  in  Section 
IIB,  α  is the slope of the utility function for wealth levels above the reference point 
(  w   ∗  ) relative to the slope below the reference point, i.e., the sharpness of the kink 
in the utility function at   w   ∗  . This parameter is often referred to as the “coefficient of 
loss aversion” (Tversky and Kahneman 1991).
The table below repeats the conditions required for a customer to choose to bring 
a reusable bag under the three policies assuming reference-dependent preferences 
from Section IIB. To connect the model with the data, I divide through by  γ  so that 
all variables are in money-metric units. If  F  is the distribution of   c i   , the proportion 
of customers bringing a reusable bag when there is no incentive, when there is a 
bonus, and when there is a tax are  F(0) ,  F(x) , and  F(αx) , respectively. Recall that 
we observe these proportions in the data in the previous section.

To provide a  back-of-the-envelope estimate of the coefficient of loss aversion, 
suppose  that   F   is  a  normal  distribution  with  mean μ  and  variance    σ   2  .  Using  the 
first two moments in the above table, μ and   σ   2   are  just-identified, with  μ  =  $0.56  
and   σ  =  $0.50 .  Using  these  parameters,  the  coefficient  of  loss  aversion  can  be 
estimated by choosing  α  to fit the third moment,  F(αx)  =  0.442 . After adjusting 
for   under-awareness  of  the  bonus,  this  approach  yields  an  estimate  of   α  =  5.3 .

In words, this estimated coefficient of loss aversion suggests that a bonus would 
have  to  be  $0.25  in  order  to  have  the  same  behavioral  impact  as  the   $0.05  tax. 
Bootstrapping this approach yields a 95 percent confidence interval of  [3.3, 14.8] .33 
Previous papers that estimate the coefficient of loss aversion using lab experiments, 
such as Tversky and Kahneman (1991), typically estimate values of  α  of just over 2, 
which are exceeded by even the lower end of this range of estimates. The large esti-
mated value of  α  is consistent with loss aversion being stronger in this setting than 
in other contexts in which it has been observed or, alternatively, may suggest that 
one or more of the other explanations discussed in Section V could be contributing 
to the large effect of the tax.

B.  Expectations-Based Reference Points

Up to this point, analyses in this paper involving  reference-dependent preferences 
assume that a customer’s wealth in the absence of an incentive policy serves as her 
reference point, i.e., her reference point is her wealth when disposable bags are free. 
However,  work  by  Ko˝szegi  and  Rabin (2006)  suggests  that  reference  points  are 
generated by an individual’s expectations about their wealth. If a customer believes 
that disposable bags are free, then a $0.05 tax will feel like a loss. Alternatively, if 
a customer expects to pay a  $0.05 tax per bag, this theory of reference point forma-
tion suggests that she will not experience a loss when paying the tax because she 
expected to pay the tax. If reference points are indeed based on expectations, this 
suggests that customers may decrease their disposable bag use before their expecta-
tions have adjusted to the new policy (e.g., in the early days of implementation), but 
that this effect should rebound once customers adjust their expectations.
This section analyzes a  transaction-level scanner dataset from a large retail chain 
in Washington, DC and Montgomery County to estimate the  long-term impact of the 
tax on disposable bag use. This data includes a line item that indicates if a customer 
was charged a tax during a given transaction that can be used to calculate daily esti-
mates of the fraction of customers using at least one disposable bag following the 
implementation of the tax.34 The data includes transactions from January 1, 2010 to 
June 30, 2012, which allows me to track disposable bag use for two and a half years 
in Washington, DC and six months in Montgomery County.

Figure 5, panel A plots the percent of customers using a disposable bag in stores 
located in Washington, DC starting on the first day of the tax policy on January 1, 
2010.35 The  figure shows that 58.1 percent of customers used at least one  disposable 

33 Specifically, I resample from the data without replacement to generate new means for the fraction of con-
sumers bringing a reusable bag, and use the new means to estimate a new value of  α . I repeat this procedure 1,000 
times. The 95 percent confidence interval for  α  is obtained by selecting the values of  α  that correspond to the fifth 
and ninety-fifth percentile of the  αs  generated by this approach. 
34 This data includes information on whether a customer was charged for using a disposable bag during a given 
transaction, which allows me to compute aggregate daily averages of the percent of customers using disposable 
bags, but are not informative as to the number of bags used by a particular consumer. Additionally, since I only have 
a measure of bag use when a customer is charged a tax, I do not have data on disposable bag use in periods prior 
to the implementation of the tax or in locations that did not pass a tax policy. Lastly, this particular chain did not 
offer customers a bonus, so I cannot use this data to analyze the relative effectiveness of a tax versus a bonus policy. 
35 I drop two days in February 2010 where I observe an unusually low number of transactions due to a blizzard 

in the area.

Figure 5. Proportion of Customers Using a Disposable Bag after Implementation of the Tax

bag on the first day the tax was implemented, but that this estimate decreased to 
41.5 percent by the last week of the month. The figure does not show a decrease 
in  disposable  bag  use  during  the  month  of  January  in  the  two  subsequent  years, 
suggesting that the decrease in bag use is likely associated with the implementation 
of the tax and not simply due to seasonal fluctuations in bag use. Figure 5, panel B 
shows a similar pattern in Montgomery County after the implementation of its tax 
on January 1, 2012. On the first day of the Montgomery County tax, 39.8 percent 
of customers used at least one disposable bag, but by the last week in January, this 
estimate decreased to 26.3 percent.

What is particularly remarkable about this change in behavior is its persistence. 
While  disposable  bag  use  in  both  Washington,  DC  and  Montgomery  County 
decreased by roughly 15 percentage points over the first month of the tax, this esti-
mate remained at the new lower level for the rest of the sample period. In  contrast,

a  model  of   expectations-based  reference  dependence  would  predict  that  bag  use 
would  rebound  to  its   pre-tax  level  once  customers  grew  accustomed  to  the  tax. 
While these results do not rule out the possibility of such a model—for example, 
the absence of a rebound effect could be explained by habit formation of using a 
reusable bag—the data is more consistent with a model of reference dependence in 
which a customer’s reference point is fixed at her wealth level when disposable bags 
have a price of zero.

VII.  Conclusion

This paper investigates the relative impact of two incentives aimed at reducing 
the use of disposable shopping bags: a $0.05 tax on disposable bag use and a  $0.05 
bonus for reusable bag use. I find that the tax policy reduced the overall demand for 
disposable bags by over half and prompted consumers to substitute to reusable alter-
natives; this is particularly notable given the relatively small size of the tax itself. 
The large effect of the tax is also striking given that the bonus had almost no impact 
on bag use, a result that is consistent with a model of loss aversion. I present evi-
dence that differences in awareness of the two policies and changes in social norms 
cannot fully account for my results.

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  effect  of  this  tax  is  not  only  large  in  absolute 
terms,  but  also  in  comparison  to  previous  estimates  of  the  impact  of  other  types 
of sin taxes. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the 
elasticity of demand for disposable bags may be substantially greater than the elas-
ticity of demand for other goods—the average consumer may be willing to forgo 
the convenience of using a disposable bag, but not willing to cut back on her con-
sumption soda or other taxed goods. Second, the visibility of the bag tax, which is 
prominently displayed at grocery store registers, may help explain why it has had 
a larger effect than other taxes, which tend to be less salient (Chetty, Looney, and 
Kroft 2009; Goldin 2015). Third, the large change in demand for disposable bags 
following the tax may stem from levying a price on a good that had previously been 
free (Shampanier, Mazar, and Ariely 2007). Finally, even a small initial impact of 
the tax can generate large effects if the reputation costs of using disposable bags 
increases by way of a social multiplier (Benabou and Tirole 2011).
The results from this study have implications for several existing policies that use 
small financial incentives to nudge individuals toward a desirable behavior. Policies 
that  provide  discounts  to  coffee  drinkers  who  use  their  own  mug  may  not  be  as 
effective as those that charge for the use of a paper cup. Similarly, government pro-
grams that award tax credits to customers who purchase  environmentally friendly 
Energy Star products may be less effective than policies that tax  energy-inefficient 
products. Outside of environmental policies,  Rees-Jones (2017) suggests that alter-
ing income tax withholding policies (resulting in fewer taxpayers having a tax lia-
bility versus a refund) could have significant effects on tax evasion. Most recently, 
a Supreme Court case36 challenged state laws that prohibit retailers from imposing

surcharges on credit card purchases to cover “swipe fees,” but allow for discounts on 
 non-credit card purchases. This paper suggests that the framing of the policy—the 
First Amendment issue in question—could have a significant impact on credit card 
use, even when the incentives are very small (credit card companies charge mer-
chants swipe fees of 2 to 3 percent of the sales price). As Justice Breyer pointed out 
during the case, “a discount and a surcharge are the same thing economically. But 
we live in a world in which not everyone is an economist” (Liptak 2017).

B. The Effect of the Tax in Bonus versus  Non-bonus Stores

The main analysis of the effect of the tax in Section IVA includes stores that 
also offered customers a  $0.05 bonus for reusable bag use. This section estimates 
whether the tax had a differential impact in stores that offered a bonus and stores 
that did not by including interactions for whether the store provided a bonus. The 
results  in Table A2  show  that  the  effect  of  the  tax  on  the  likelihood  of  using  a 
disposable bag is slightly smaller (2.2 percentage points) in bonus stores, but this 
difference is not statistically significant. The table also shows that the effect of the 
tax on any reusable bag use is slightly higher in bonus stores while the effect on 
using no bags is significantly lower, though neither effect is statistically signifi-
cant. Taken together, this suggests that the tax has a similar impact on disposable 
bag use in both types of stores, but that customers in bonus stores were somewhat 
more likely to switch to reusable bag use than to opt to use no bags at all.

This  section  investigates  whether  the  tax  policy  had  an  impact  on  store  vol-
ume (total  expenditure  and  the  number  of  transactions)  as  well  as  on  shopping

This store did not offer a bonus at any point during the sample period. Since the data 
spans the implementation of both the Washington, DC and Montgomery County tax, 
I use the following specification:

 

  Y isdmy    =  α +  β DC   D D DC, sy   +  β MD   D D MD, sy   +  γ m   +  δ y   +  μ s   +  ε isdmy    ,

month  m  in year  y  ,  D D DC    is an indicator for stores in Washington, DC after the tax 
was passed (Post DC tax × DC),  D D MD    is an indicator for stores in Montgomery 
County after the tax was passed (Post MD tax × MD), and μ,  γ , and  δ  are a set 
of store, month, and year fixed effects. The coefficients of interest,   β DC    and   β MD    , 
are the  difference-in-difference estimates of the effect of the Washington, DC and 
Montgomery County taxes on shopping behavior, respectively.

Results show that neither the Washington, DC nor the Montgomery County tax 
led to a significant change in the daily store volume measured as either the number 
of transactions (column 1) or the total expenditure (column 2). The taxes also did not 
change the average basket size, i.e., the number of items per transaction (column 3).

D. Survey Measure of Policy Effectiveness

To  investigate  the  relative  effectiveness  of  the  tax  and  bonus  policies  without 
assuming comparability between customers at bonus and  non-bonus stores, I sur-
veyed grocery store customers about how they would respond to a hypothetical tax 
or bonus policy. I asked respondents if a  $0.05 incentive influenced their decision to 
bring a reusable bag when shopping at that store, randomizing whether the incentive 
was framed as a tax or a bonus.37 Participants were instructed to give one of the 
following five responses: definitely, quite a bit, somewhat, very little, or not at all. 
Table A4 presents results of the following linear probability model:

 

  Y i    =   θ 0   +  θ 1    Tax i   + λ X i   +  ε i  , 

where  Y  is the probability that survey participant i gave a response of “definitely;”  
Tax  is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the participant was asked 
about a tax policy and zero for a bonus policy; and  X  is a vector of individual demo-
graphic characteristics including sex, race, age, education, and income. Of the cus-
tomers  who  were  asked  about  the  influence  of  the  bonus  program,  19.4  percent 
responded that the policy would definitely influence their decision. This average is 

37 This question was phrased as a hypothetical for customers in stores that did not already have the policy or for 

customers who were previously unaware of the existence of the policy.

significantly lower—28.6 percentage points lower—than the proportion of custom-
ers who responded similarly when asked about the tax policy.38

E. Tax Aversion

Recent evidence from the lab and field suggests that individuals are more likely to 
avoid taxes than other costs of the same amount, i.e., they are  tax-averse (Li, Linn, and 
Muehlegger 2014; Sussman and Olivola 2011). If customers treat taxes differently 
than other types of incentives, this could generate the differential responses to the tax 
and bonus policies. Since there were no policies that charged a fee for a disposable 
bag (rather than a tax), I rely on data from a randomized experiment using an online 
platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk, to test for tax aversion in this context. The sur-
vey questions mirror the questions asked in the  in-store survey described in Appendix 
Section  D,  in  which  participants  were  asked  about  their  perceived  responses  to  a 
bonus versus a tax. In this survey, participants were randomly assigned to answer how 
they believed they would respond to a  store-imposed fee or a  government-imposed 
tax. Table A5  presents  these  results  using  the  same  specifications  and  controls  as 
in Table A4. While this analysis should be viewed as merely suggestive due to the 

38 The results are qualitatively similar when the dependent variable is the probability that the survey participant 
responded that the incentive would influence his decision to bring a reusable bag “quite a bit” or when using an 
ordered probit.

hypothetical nature of the questions, the results show no differences in the responses 
of participants in the “tax” group compared to the “fee” group.
