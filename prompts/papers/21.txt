Contagious Effects of a Political Intervention
in Debt Contracts: Evidence Using
Loan-Level Data

Prasanna L. Tantri
Indian School of Business

Using an unexpected government regulation that restricted the ability of microﬁnance
institutions to recover loans in one Indian state, I examine whether this intervention affected
bank loan performance. The bank loan delinquency rate signiﬁcantly increased as a result.
In response, the ex post bank credit supply declined by more than half. For identiﬁcation,
I compare loans from branches located in regions subject to this intervention with loans
from nearby branches of the same bank located in regions not subject to the intervention.
I conclude that political interventions in credit markets could have signiﬁcant spillover
effects.

Received October 29, 2016; editorial decision November 28, 2017 by Editor Philip Strahan.
Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University
Press Web site next to the link to the ﬁnal published paper online.

A large body of literature has examined the consequences of political
intervention in private debt contracts (Agarwal et al. 2016; Bolton and Rosenthal
2002; Kroszner 2003; Melzer 2011; Mian and Suﬁ 2014) on ex post outcomes
within the segment of the credit market subject to the intervention. However, the
possibility of such an intervention having a contagious effect on other segments
of the credit market that are not subject to the intervention has not received much
attention. Such an analysis is important to understand the full costs and beneﬁts
of political interventions in debt contracts.1

either the Great Depression (Bolton and Rosenthal 2002; Rucker and Alston 1987) or the recent ﬁnancial crisis
(Mayer et al. 2014) as the economic setting. It is difﬁcult to study spillover effects using such settings, as even
parts of the credit market not subject to interventions were in turmoil in these settings, and many interventions
took place simultaneously.

Contagious Effects of a Political Intervention in Debt Contracts

I use a large shock delivered by an unexpected government regulation
to microﬁnance institutions’ ability to recover loans in one Indian state
as an economic setting and examine the plausible spillover impact of this
intervention on bank loans in the geographic region subject to the intervention.
Speciﬁcally, I ask the following two questions. First, did the performance of
bank loans, deﬁned in terms of the default rate, deteriorate in regions subject
to the microﬁnance intervention? Second, anticipating deterioration in loan
performance, did banks curtail credit in the post-intervention period?

The economic setting for this study is provided by an ordinance issued by
the state government of Andhra Pradesh2 on October 15, 2010. Breza and
Kinnan (2016) study the impact of the above event on the local economy.
They document signiﬁcant negative effects on consumption, employment, and
entrepreneurship. Breza (2012) uses an earlier incident of sudden increase in
microﬁnance defaults in one district of Andhra Pradesh to study the impact
of a borrower’s loan repayment decision on peers. I focus on bank loans.
The government imposed severe restrictions on the loan recovery practices
followed by microﬁnance lenders in the state. That the state government issued
an ordinance3 and did not wait for the legislation to pass shows the urgency
and speed with which the government reacted.

The reason for this quick reaction was an allegation leveled by the opposition
parties and media that the harsh recovery practices adopted by microﬁnance
institutions led 57 individuals to commit suicide in Andhra Pradesh (Kar
2013). As I will discuss in Section 2.1, the numbers compiled by the national
crimes database do not show an abnormal increase in suicides related to high
indebtedness in the state of Andhra Pradesh when compared with neighboring
states. Therefore, it is reasonable to categorize the state government’s reaction
as an exercise to limit political damage caused by the opposition’s propaganda
and not as a reasonable reaction to the sudden implosion of an economic
crisis. Careful analysis of news around the time of the event shows that no
other signiﬁcant economic event affecting only the state of Andhra Pradesh
took place close to the notiﬁcation date. The impact of the regulation
on microﬁnance lending in Andhra Pradesh was swift and signiﬁcant; the
microﬁnance delinquency ratio increased from less than 1% to nearly 90%
(Kar 2013). The lone listed microﬁnance stock, SKS microﬁnance, fell by
6.5% on October 15, 2010, by 26% within one month and by 48% within three
months.4

2 Andhra Pradesh was one of the largest states of India. It is now divided into two states, Andhra Pradesh and

Telangana. I consider the undivided Andhra Pradesh state in this study.

3 An ordinance is issued by an executive to promulgate a law when the legislature is in recess. The ordinance
becomes a law as soon it is signed by the governor of the state and notiﬁed in the state gazette. However, the
ordinance needs to be approved by the state legislature within six months. Otherwise, it lapses and, hence, ceases
to be a law.

4 The stock eventually lost nearly 90% of its original market value. The benchmark market index lost only about

7% during this period.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 31 n 11 2018

I collect proprietary transaction-level data relating to crop loans from a large
government-owned bank in India. I have time series information about all
transactions executed by these borrowers. The data set includes loans made
by bank branches located in Andhra Pradesh and nearby branches located in
the border districts of two other neighboring states, Maharashtra and Karnataka.
All bank branches from which I obtained data are located in border districts of
the above three states.

A crucial aspect of my analysis is that all the loans I examine in this study
are bullet loans with tenure of one year. In other words, repayment of the loans,
along with interest, is expected in one installment. No intermediate payments
are speciﬁed. A loan is considered to be in default if the total outstanding
amount including interest is not repaid on or before the due date. A loan lent
on, say, January 1 of a year, will be considered in default if it is not fully repaid
on or before December 31 of the same year.

I ﬁrst identify loans made before October 15, 2010 (event date, henceforth),
whose due dates were immediately after the event date. I call such loans
“affected loans.” For example, take the case of a loan made on November
15, 2009. The due date for this loan was November 15, 2010, one month
after the event date. Similarly, I identify loans whose due dates were just
prior to the event date. I call such loans “unaffected loans.” For example,
consider a loan made on September 15, 2009. The due date for this loan
was September 15, 2010, one month before the event date. This way of
identifying affected and unaffected loans has two distinct advantages. First,
the decision to provide a loan is made long before the event. Hence, the
loans are not affected by loan ofﬁcer selection after the event. Second,
given the bullet
the decision of whether to default on
affected (unaffected) loans has to be made after (before) the event date. This
requirement signiﬁcantly strengthens identiﬁcation. Using the above facts, I
design difference-in-differences (DID, henceforth) and regression discontinuity
(RD, henceforth) tests to assess the impact of the event on bank loan
performance.

loan structure,

For DID tests, the ﬁrst difference is provided by the difference in default rates
between affected and unaffected loans made by branches located in Andhra
Pradesh. Using the fact that the law change applied only to Andhra Pradesh,
I design a counterfactual difference: the difference in default rates between
affected and unaffected loans made by branches located in the other two
states. The difference between the above two differences is the DID measure. I
examine and ﬁnd the existence of a close to parallel trend between the treatment
and control regions during the pre-event period. All the branches I study are
located in the border districts of their respective states and, hence, are in
close geographical proximity. As expected, I do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences
between the treatment and control regions in terms of pre-treatment observable
characteristics, such as loan performance, loan size, rainfall, crop area and
yield, and agricultural credit.

Contagious Effects of a Political Intervention in Debt Contracts

I ﬁnd that the default rate of treatment loans is about 18.6 (19) percentage
points higher when compared with the default rate of control loans based
on DID estimates when I limit the sample to loans having due dates within
three (six) months on either side of the event date. Here, I compare loans
with due dates between October 15, 2010, and January 15, 2011 (April 15,
2011), with loans with due dates between July 15, 2010 (April 15, 2010), and
October 14, 2010. The above differences are both statistically and economically
signiﬁcant.

I use the classiﬁcation of a loan as a nonperforming asset (NPA) as the second
loan performance measure. A crop loan that remains in default for at least two
crop seasons is considered an NPA. A crop season is deﬁned as six months
for rice, the underlying crop for loans under consideration. Therefore, a loan
will be categorized as an NPA if it remains in default for at least 365 days. A
loan borrowed on, say, January 1, 2010, will be classiﬁed as an NPA if it is not
fully repaid on or before December 31, 2011. The loan would be classiﬁed as
being in default on December 31, 2010. The provisioning requirement goes up
signiﬁcantly if a loan is recognized as an NPA. A loan being classiﬁed as an NPA
impacts the loan ofﬁcer’s appraisal scores negatively (Bhowal, Subramanian,
and Tantri 2014). If one bank loan of a borrower is categorized as an NPA, all
other loans of that borrower with the same bank are also classiﬁed as NPAs.
This impacts the borrower’s credit score signiﬁcantly. For tests that use NPA
status as the dependent variable, I consider loans that were in default but had
not reached the due date for recognition as an NPA as of October 15, 2010, as
“affected loans,” and loans in default whose NPA due dates were just before
October 15, 2010, as “unaffected loans.” I ﬁnd that the NPA rate of “affected
loans” is 30.2 percentage points higher than that of “unaffected loans” based
on DID estimates when I limit the sample to defaulted loans with NPA due
dates within three months on either side of the event date. The results remain
qualitatively similar when I extend the window to six months.

To buttress the ﬁndings further, I use a robust RD design (Calonico, Cattaneo,
and Titiunik 2014). Here, I use the notiﬁcation date, October 15, 2010, as the
cutoff and the distance between the due date of a loan and the cutoff as the
running variable. For example, for a loan with the due date of October 12 (18),
the running variable takes the value of −3 (3). As before, loan performance,
denoted by whether or not a loan defaults (or turns into an NPA), is the dependent
variable. The due date, respectively, refers to the due date for default or for
becoming an NPA when I use default or NPA as the dependent variable. The RD
test detects a 12.4 percentage point jump in the default rate and a 24.5 percentage
point jump in the NPA rate at the cutoff for loans made by Andhra Pradesh
branches. No such signiﬁcant discontinuity is detected in control regions.

I perform several robustness tests to rule out other explanations. First, I
perform placebo tests and ﬁnd that the results are robust. Second, I limit the
treatment and control samples to regions that are contiguous and, hence, are
located very close to each other. The main results are replicated even in this

subsample. Third, I perform two external validation tests. For the ﬁrst external
validation test, I collect data pertaining to the delinquency rates of all listed
banks in India, including private banks, and I compare the delinquency rates of
banks with high exposure to Andhra Pradesh with those of other banks in a DID
setting. The level of exposure and the period (pre- or post-intervention) provide
the two differences. I ﬁnd that banks with high exposure to Andhra Pradesh
experience higher delinquency rates in the post-notiﬁcation period based on
DID estimates. For the second external validation test, I use the Indian farm
debt waiver of 2008 as the economic setting. Gine and Kanz (2017) ﬁnd that the
waiver program led to deterioration in the loan performance of the beneﬁciaries.
Given the ﬁndings described so far, I expect the impact of the waiver to spill
over to the nonbeneﬁciaries as well. Using the RD strategy described above, I
ﬁnd that the waiver program led to worsening of the loan performance of the
nonbeneﬁciaries as well. This supports the thesis that political intervention
could have a contagious impact. Here, the contagion spreads within the
segment.

In the second part of the study, I look at the intervention’s impact on
subsequent functioning of the credit markets. I employ the robust RD design
with a similar setup as described before. Here, I organize the data at a branch-
day level. I calculate the daily loan amount at the branch level, which becomes
the dependent variable. I ﬁnd that the daily loan amount lent by Andhra Pradesh
branches experiences a sharp discontinuity at the cutoff. The daily loan amount
at the branch level falls by 54.8%. However, I do not detect any signiﬁcant
discontinuity in the loan amount lent by branches located outside Andhra
Pradesh. Furthermore, the decline in loans seems to be driven by the intensive
margin, as I do not detect any discontinuity in the number of loans granted per
day.

Although I show that a government intervention in one segment of the credit
market has adverse spillover impacts on loan performance and loan supply in
other segments, due to data limitations, I cannot precisely pin down the exact
mechanism at work. First, it is possible that the curtailment of microﬁnance
credit adversely affected Andhra Pradesh’s agricultural economy (Breza and
Kinnan 2016; Sane and Thomas 2016) and that this impact led to increased
bank loan defaults. The results show a sharp jump in defaults immediately after
the event, implying that at least a part of the result is not caused by the above
mechanism. The real effects of a loan supply shock are likely to take some time
to manifest and spread through economic linkages.5 However, it is not possible
to fully rule out the above explanation.

A second possibility is that bank borrowers defaulted anticipating a future
government intervention in bank loans. In this case, the reaction is likely to be
quick. Therefore, a decline in loan performance immediately after the event

5 I thank an anonymous referee for pointing this out.

Contagious Effects of a Political Intervention in Debt Contracts

is consistent with the moral hazard view. This discussion applies to the ﬂow
of bank credit in the post-event period as well. It is possible that loan ofﬁcers
tightened their lending anticipating deterioration in loan performance. It is
also possible that adverse economic effects of the intervention led to reduced
loan demand. Admittedly, I do not have data pertaining to loan applications,
and, hence, disentangling the impact of demand from supply is a challenge.
However, as stated above, the manifestation of demand effect is likely to take
time, and, hence, an immediate decline in credit ﬂow is likely to be the result
of the tightening of supply. However, the existence of demand effects cannot
be completely ruled out.

I contribute to two distinct strands of literature. First, this study is related
to a large body of empirical literature that examines the consequences of
political interventions in private loan contracts (Agarwal et al. 2016; Bolton
and Rosenthal 2002: De and Tantri 2014; Gine and Kanz 2017; Mayer et al.
2014; Mukherjee, Subramanian, and Tantri 2014; Rucker and Alston 1987). I
contribute to this literature by showing that a government intervention in one
segment of the credit market could cause ripple effects on other segments.
Second, I also contribute to the literature that highlights the possibility of a
ﬁnancial contagion (Acemoglu et al. 2015; Allen and Gale 2000; Bae, Karolyi,
and Stulz 2003; Bekaert et al. 2014; Billio et al. 2012). I argue that a political
intervention in one segment of the credit market could be the source of a
contagion.

1. Institutional Background

1.1 Indian banking
The Indian banking landscape, even to this day, is dominated by public sector
banks. Public sector banks account for more than 70% of the bank credit in
India.6 Banks and micro-ﬁnance institutions are linked directly, as bank loans
are one of the most important sources of funding for micro-ﬁnance institutions
(ET Bureau 2015). Banks in India are tightly regulated by the Reserve Bank of
India.

1.2 Agricultural lending in India
As described earlier, I use crop loan data. The majority of the Indian population,
even to this day, is dependent on agriculture. Agriculture is considered as a
“priority sector,” and, hence, all banks are required to direct at least 18% of their
credit to agriculture (Cole 2009b). Although banking is a federal subject, local
politicians often intervene in the recovery process with an eye on borrowers’
votes (Mukherjee, Subramanian, and Tantri 2014).7 Local politicians are

6 https://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=38738.
7 Moreover, agricultural loans are excluded from the purview of many recent laws that have signiﬁcantly enhanced

creditor rights (Bhue, Prabhala, and Tantri 2015).

The Review of Financial Studies / v 31 n 11 2018

members of state-level bankers’ committees that set broad guidelines regarding
agricultural lending in the state.8

1.2.1 Loan features. Having brieﬂy discussed the broad institutional
framework applicable to agricultural lending in India, I proceed to describe
the relevant loan features. As noted earlier, all the loans I consider are crop
loans with tenure of 12 months. I verify this fact using a sample loan contract
obtained from the bank. The underlying crop is rice. Moreover, the loans I study
are bullet loans to be repaid in a single installment. In other words, there are no
intermediate payments to be made.9 This type of loan structure suits farmers
who are likely to earn most of their revenue within a short interval, that is,
immediately following the harvest season.

1.2.2 Measures of loan performance. Broadly, a crop loan that is not fully
repaid is classiﬁed as either current, in default, or as an NPA. Every loan is
classiﬁed as current until the due date. A loan that is not fully repaid as on
the due date is considered to be in default. Figure 8, presented in the Online
Appendix, depicts the above classiﬁcations. I provide an example to clarify
the above classiﬁcation further. Suppose, three farmers, A, B, and C, borrow
INR10 10,000 each on January 1, 2010. The due date for all three loans will be
December 31, 2010. All three loans are classiﬁed as current until the end of the
day on December 31, 2010. Assume that A repays her/his loan on December
31, 2010, just before the end of the working hours of the bank. A’s loan account
gets closed. Also assume that B and C do not fully repay their loans by the end
of the day on December 31, 2010. Crop loans lent to B and C will be classiﬁed
as loans in default starting from January 1, 2011. It is crucial to note that even a
delay of one day beyond the due date in loan repayment leads to classiﬁcation
of a loan as being in default. Classiﬁcation of a borrower’s loan as a loan
in default negatively impacts the borrower’s credit score, possibly restricting
future access to credit. The default status also triggers recovery procedures,
starting from constant reminders to issue of legal notice.

The next stage of loan classiﬁcation after default is the NPA stage. A loan
that remains in default for at least two crop seasons is classiﬁed as an NPA.11
In case of rice, the underlying crop in the sample, a crop season is deﬁned as
six months. Therefore, effectively, a loan that remains in default for 365 days
or more is classiﬁed as an NPA. Going back to the earlier example, the deadline

8 The state-level bankers’ committee determines the deﬁnition of the season for each crop, reviews the ﬂow
of agricultural credit, and makes nonbinding recommendations to banks regarding the allocation of credit to
agriculture within the state, and constantly monitors the ﬂow of bank credit to agriculture within the state.

9 However, I observe that some borrowers do make partial payments.

for NPA classiﬁcation for loans borrowed on January 1, 2010, is December 31,
2011, that is, one year from the due date of December 31, 2010, and—given
the 365-day loan tenure—two years from the date of loan issuance. Suppose
B repays the loan in full along with interest and penalty before December 31,
2010, but C fails to do so. C’s loan will be classiﬁed as an NPA starting from
January 1, 2011.

The classiﬁcation of a loan as an NPA has signiﬁcant consequences for
the bank, the loan ofﬁcer, and the borrower. From the bank’s point of view,
the provisioning requirement is signiﬁcantly higher for NPAs when compared
with default.12 NPA management gets a weightage of 10% in a loan ofﬁcer’s
annual appraisal. I present a pro forma appraisal form in the Online Appendix.
Classiﬁcation of a loan as an NPA allows a bank to initiate action under
The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement
of Security Interest Act 2002 (SARFAESI Act). The SARFAESI Act allows
the lender to seize collateral without obtaining prior permission from a court
of law. Prior to SARFAESI, a lender needed explicit approval from a court to
seize collateral. A lender can proceed under SARFAESI only after classifying a
loan as an NPA and providing a 60-day notice to the borrower (Alok, Chaurey,
and Nukala 2016; Vig 2013). Mere default does not trigger SARFAESI action.
Finally, if one loan borrowed by a borrower from a bank turns into an NPA,
then all other loans borrowed by the same borrower from the same bank
are considered as NPAs. Therefore, the impact of NPA classiﬁcation on a
borrower’s credit score is much higher than the impact of default.

1.3 Microﬁnance
Microﬁnance is a form of ﬁnancial service for the poor and small enterprises
(Kannan, and Panneerselvam 2013). It is based on the idea of providing ﬁnancial
services to the poor through market-based structures. Muhammad Yunus, who
started the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, pioneered the recent round of the
microﬁnance revolution in emerging and under-developed economies. The key
feature of microﬁnance lending is that the focus is on lending to close-knit
groups and not to individuals (Banerjee et al. 2015; Breza 2012). Such groups
work as informal enforcement mechanisms. As per World Bank’s estimates,
microﬁnance now serves 16 million people all over the world (Longhurst 2013).
Microﬁnance in India grew at an annualized rate of 83% between 2003
and 2010 (M CRILL 2012). The delinquency rate of microﬁnance loans made
during that period was less than 1% (Kaur and Dey 2013). Although industry
insiders attribute this performance to better process, there have been allegations
that microﬁnance lenders adopted coercive recovery practices (Kar 2013;
Shylendra 2006). Andhra Pradesh, the state under consideration in this study,
was at the forefront of microﬁnance growth in India. Lending to close-knit

self-help groups was the delivery model adopted by microﬁnance institutions
in Andhra Pradesh.

2. The Event

2.1 Background
Microﬁnance was not tightly regulated in India in the late 1990s and early
2000s (Singh 2003). In 2006, 10 people who also happened to be microﬁnance
borrowers committed suicide in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. Local
media and politicians blamed the suicides on “coercive” recovery practices
adopted by microﬁnance institutions. This led to the forced shutdown of two
branches of two large microﬁnance lenders (Ghate 2008). The government of
Andhra Pradesh refrained from intervening in the microﬁnance sector until
the year 2010. In 2010, newspapers reported that 57 microﬁnance borrowers
committed suicide due to the “coercive recovery practices” of microﬁnance
institutions and “excessive” borrowing. These reports created a huge furor,
with the opposition parties blaming the government for being a mute spectator
(Bandyopadhyay 2014).

However, a cursory look at the national crimes database shows that, in total,
15,901 individuals committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh in the year 2010, and
this number was not signiﬁcantly different from those of the neighboring states
of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. More importantly, a careful look
at the suicide notes reveals that bankruptcy or a sudden change in economic
status were not the major reasons for the suicides (IANS 2015). Given the above
details, it appears that the government’s decision to intervene was a knee-jerk
reaction to limit political damage.

2.2 Ordinance
As a response, the Andhra Pradesh government issued an ordinance titled “The
Andhra Pradesh Micro Finance Institutions (Regulation of Money Lending)
Rules 2010” on October 15, 2010. This ordinance imposed severe restrictions
on the recovery practices of microﬁnance institutions. Some of the important
restrictions included the following:

• Compulsory registration of all microﬁnance institutions with the district

administration

• Ban on the door-to-door collection of loans
• Public disclosure of interest rates
• Heavy punishment, including imprisonment

The ordinance was ratiﬁed by the state assembly on December 15, 2010.13
The direct impact of the notiﬁcation was stark. Loan performance deteriorated

13 The ordinance was challenged in the High Court and later in the Supreme Court and was upheld by both.

and loan uptake decreased in the microﬁnance sector. The loan repayment rate
fell drastically from 99% to 10%. Microﬁnance loan growth fell from 95%
to 17% per annum (Kar 2013). The enormity of the regulation is evidenced
by the steep fall in the stock price of the only listed microﬁnance stock, SKS
microﬁnance. INR 100 invested in SKS just before the announcement of the
regulation was worth only INR 11 in a year’s time, whereas the benchmark
index lost only about 7% during this period.

3. Data, Variable Deﬁnitions, and Summary Statistics

In this section, I describe the data and provide basic summary statistics.

3.1 Data
I obtain transaction-level data from a large government-owned bank in India.
The bank operates more than 1,000 branches and has more than 70 years of
operating history. Bhowal, Subramanian, and Tantri (2014) use the same data
to study the costs of job rotation. Details about the data are presented in Table 1.
I obtain data from 14 branches of the bank located in three large states of India,
namely, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.14 The data collection
exercise was not undertaken with the view to examine the microﬁnance event.
Its purpose was to study the impact of various institutional changes on farm
loans. Of the 14 branches, one branch located in Andhra Pradesh did not have
any agricultural loans outstanding during the event period. Therefore, I use
loan data drawn from 13 branches of the bank. The data set spans the period
between October 2005 and May 2012. The bank also provided us information
about whether or not a borrower is a beneﬁciary of the national debt waiver
awarded in the year 2008.

14 The data were collected from the branches, and, hence, the sample size is limited to 14 branches. The border

districts were chosen ﬁrst. The bank branches within these districts were selected through a lottery.

Figure 1
Agro-climatic regions of India
This ﬁgure shows the different agro-climatic regions of India. The bank branches from which I obtain data are
all located in zone number 10. Source: Planning Commission of India.

As described earlier, I follow Ponticelli and Alencar (2016) and Banerjee and
Iyer (2005) in designing the identiﬁcation strategy. I compare the outcomes at
bank branches located in areas that received the treatment with outcomes at
bank branches located in neighboring areas that did not receive the treatment.
Therefore, the distance between the treated and control branches becomes a
critical factor for identiﬁcation. As shown in Figure 1, all 14 bank branches are
part of a single agro-climatic region and, hence, are subject to similar weather
shocks.

I calculate the pairwise distance from each branch located in Andhra Pradesh
to the branches located in the other two states. I report the average for these
pairwise distances in Table 1. The average distance, so calculated, between
the Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra branches is 222 miles, and the average
distance between the Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka branches is 277 miles.
This result compares well with the average distance of 150 miles between
branches located within Andhra Pradesh. Furthermore, the three states under
consideration are large states of India, with a combined area of 299,126 square

In this table, I compare Andhra Pradesh districts and the other two states’ districts in
terms of variables ranging from crop yield to rainfall. I consider only those districts
where the bank branches from which I source data are located. I calculate the within-
state average for the years 2009 and 2010. I obtain data related to crop yields and crop
area from the federal agricultural ministry, rainfall from the meteorological department,
credit from the central bank, and inﬂation from the national statistics ofﬁce.

miles.15 Not surprisingly, the treatment and control regions share similar
observable characteristics. I provide these details in Table 2. I compare the
regions on several observable characteristics, such as rainfall, crop yield, area
under cultivation, and agricultural credit, before the intervention.

In total, I have data relating to 37,556 loans lent before the event date by 44
loan ofﬁcers. The data set has information about a total of 43,767 loans. Here,
I report the summary numbers by restricting the sample to loans lent before
the microﬁnance intervention. Out of these, 27,963 loans were lent by bank
branches located in the state of Andhra Pradesh, 4,100 by those in Karnataka,
and 5,493 by those in Maharashtra. These totals correspond to 3,107 loans per
branch for Andhra Pradesh branches, 2,050 for Karnataka branches, and 1,831
for Maharashtra branches. Andhra Pradesh’s average is signiﬁcantly affected
by the Karimnagar branch, which alone accounts for 12,148 loans. If I exclude
this branch, the number of loans per branch for Andhra Pradesh falls to 1,977,
which is comparable with those of the other two states. As noted earlier, the
focus here is on outstanding loans that were lent before October 15, 2010, but
were not in default as of October 15, 2010. There are 3,994 such loans. The
above details are reported in Table 1.

4. Empirical Strategy and Results

I use the fact that the notiﬁcation under study was issued by the state government
of Andhra Pradesh and, hence, was applicable only within the borders of Andhra
Pradesh after a particular date. Several inﬂuential studies (Banerjee and Iyer
2005; Butler and Cornaggia 2011; Ponticelli and Alencar 2016) use regions
that border the treatment regions in order to estimate the counterfactual. The
crucial identiﬁcation assumption is that regions located close to each other are
likely to share similar observable and unobservable characteristics, and, hence,

15 Undivided Andhra Pradesh has an area of 106,195 square miles; Karnataka has an area of 74,122 miles; and

Maharashtra has an area of 118,809 square miles.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 31 n 11 2018

any difference in outcomes that manifests after a treatment can reasonably be
attributed to the treatment. In the same spirit, I consider branches located in
Andhra Pradesh as treatment branches and branches located in regions very
close to the Andhra Pradesh branches but situated in the states of Karnataka
and Maharashtra as control branches.

Both the treatment and control branches are located within a single agro-
climatic zone in India. I illustrate this fact in Figure 1. The Planning Commission
of India16 divided the country into 15 zones based on agro-climatic conditions.
Agro-climatic conditions mainly refer to soil types, rainfall, temperature, and
water availability, which inﬂuence the type of vegetation. All the branches are
located in the southern plateau and hills zone. This zone is denoted by number
10 in Figure 1. All these branches are clustered in the northwest corner of
zone 10. It is well known that weather and other natural factors play a key
role in Indian agriculture (Burgess et al. 2011; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1993).
Moreover, as described in Section 3, all branches of the other states are located
in close proximity to the Andhra Pradesh branches, and, hence, borrowers
from across the border are likely to be similar and subject to similar economic
shocks. In Table 2, I show that the treatment and control regions compare
well in terms of several observable characteristics, such as rainfall, crop
yield, area cultivated, ﬂow of agricultural credit, and literacy in the pre-event
period.

The second part of the identiﬁcation strategy involves identifying the affected
loans. A signiﬁcant identiﬁcation challenge faced by studies that compare the
outcomes of loans made after a natural experiment with those of loans made
before the natural experiment is that post-period loans could be inﬂuenced
by selection by the loan ofﬁcer. For example, if loan ofﬁcers expect borrower
behavior to deteriorate after a debt waiver, then they may tighten credit. Credit
may be liberalized if loan ofﬁcers expect the borrowers to do better in the post-
waiver period. In this situation, a study that ﬁnds the worsening of (improvement
in) borrower behavior after a waiver by analyzing post-waiver loans may not
be able to capture the impact of selection by loan ofﬁcers. This selection may
render pre- and post-waiver loans incomparable.

The natural experiment I study provides us with an opportunity to overcome
the above limitation. The microﬁnance regulation only made loan recovery
difﬁcult in the microﬁnance segment. Prima facie, it had no impact on existing
bank loans. I use this aspect of the natural experiment to identify a group
of affected loans. I ﬁrst identify loans made by Andhra Pradesh-based bank
branches that were outstanding but not overdue as of October 15, 2010, and
whose due dates were immediately after October 15, 2010. I call these loans
“affected loans.”Given that the loans are all bullet loans with a single stipulated
payment at the end of the tenure and that their tenure is one year, these loans

Contagious Effects of a Political Intervention in Debt Contracts

Figure 2
Unaffected and affected loans: Identiﬁcation
This ﬁgure depicts the treatment and control groups. Due dates of loans are represented in the horizontal axis
with October 15, 2010, at the center. Loans with due dates before October 15, 2010, form the control group, and
loans with due dates after October 15, 2010, form the treatment group.

must have been made before October 15, 2010. Since all of these loans were
provided before the passage of the ordinance, there is little chance of a loan
ofﬁcer factoring in plausible borrower reaction to the event when lending these
loans. Therefore, the question of disentangling the borrower reaction and loan
ofﬁcer reaction is less important because the loan ofﬁcer would have made
her/his decision by the time the notiﬁcation was issued. Thus, any outcome that
arises can reasonably be attributed to the borrower.

Next, I identify loans whose due dates were just before October 15, 2010.
I call these loans “unaffected”loans. These loans were made in advance of
the event date, and also the decision to repay or default was made before the
event date. In the case of affected loans, default could have happened only after
the event date. I depict the classiﬁcation of loans into affected and unaffected
groups in Figure 2.

The above classiﬁcation of branches into treatment and control branches and
loans into affected and unaffected loans creates a good set-up for employing
the DID methodology. The difference in default rates between affected and
unaffected loans in the treatment region (Andhra Pradesh) provides the ﬁrst
difference. The counterfactual is the difference between affected and unaffected
loans in the control (Karnataka and Maharashtra) region. The difference
between the two differences is the DID measure. The event also lends itself
nicely to an RD design. In an RD framework, October 15, normalized to zero,
could be used as the cutoff, and the distance from the cutoff, in terms of days,
could be used as a running variable. By design, affected loans fall to the right
of the cutoff, and unaffected loans fall to the left. The RD can be estimated
separately for control and treatment regions.

4.1 DID test
The preceding discussion on empirical strategy sets the stage for tests designed
to establish causality. The results of the univariate tests presented in Table 3
show that the default rate increased signiﬁcantly in treatment regions in the
post-intervention period. No signiﬁcant increase is detected in control regions.

I estimate the following DID regression equation.

made by a branch j. The dependent variable, Yitj, is a dummy variable that
takes the value of one if loan i with due date within month t and provided by
branch j defaults and zero otherwise. The explanatory variable, Andhraij , is
a dummy variable that takes the value of one for loans made by branches
located in Andhra Pradesh and zero otherwise. The explanatory variable,
Affected loansit , is a dummy variable that takes the value of one for loans with a
due date after October 15, 2010, and zero otherwise. The variables Mont hit and
Branchij represent month ﬁxed effects and branch ﬁxed effects, respectively.
Xitj represents loan-level controls, such as loan size and the tenure of the loan
ofﬁcer when the loan was issued. Dtj represents time-varying district-level
controls, such as level of crop yield, total agricultural credit, and inﬂation.

The explanatory variable of interest is the interaction between Andhraij and
Affected loansit . The results are reported in Table 4. In Columns 1 and 2 (3
and 4), I limit the sample to loans with a due date within three (six) months
before and after October 15, 2010. I include branch and month ﬁxed effects
in all speciﬁcations. District and loan-level control variables are included in
Columns 2 and 4. Standard errors are clustered at the branch X month level and
adjusted for heteroscedasticity.

As shown in the table, the interaction term is consistently positive and
statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels. The increase in the default rate
ranges from 17.9 to 22.6 percentage points based on DID estimates. The default

In this table, I present the results of tests that examine the impact of the microﬁnance regulation on bank loan
defaults. The data are organized at the loan level. In Columns 1 and 2, the data are limited to loans whose due
dates are within the range of three months before and three months after October 15, 2010, that is, July 15, 2010,
to January 15, 2011. In Columns 3 and 4, the data are limited to loans whose due dates are within the range of six
months before and six months after October 15, 2010, that is, April 15, 2010, to April 15, 2011. The dependent
variable, default, is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the loan under consideration defaults and
zero otherwise. The explanatory variable, Andhra, is a dummy variable that takes the value of one for loans
made by branches located in Andhra Pradesh and zero otherwise. Affected loans is also a dummy variable that
takes the value of one for loans having due dates immediately after the event date and zero otherwise. The main
explanatory variable is the interaction between the above two variables. I use branch and month ﬁxed effects in
all columns, and I use loan-level and district-level economic variables as controls in Columns 2 and 4. Standard
errors are clustered at the branch X month level and adjusted for heteroscedasticity. t-statistics are presented
inside parentheses. ***, **, and * represent statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

rate during six months immediately before the event in Andhra Pradesh is
close to 48%. An increase in default rate by 22.6 percentage points implies an
increase by 47.08% when compared with the pre-intervention level. Therefore,
the increase is economically signiﬁcant. Furthermore, the results continue to
hold even if I drop the largest branch, Karimnagar.17

From the abovementioned results, it is reasonable to infer that government
intervention in the microﬁnance segment did have a contagious impact on bank
loans.

4.2 Impact on nonperforming assets
Given the institutional details presented in Section 1, it is not surprising that
the default rate of agricultural loans is extremely high at 62% in the overall
sample and 48% during six months immediately before the event. This number
seems abnormally high. However, none of the institutional features relevant
for banking changed during the sample period. Furthermore, I look at changes
based on DID estimates rather than changes in levels. Nonetheless, I reexamine
the results using a second measure of loan performance. As per the Reserve
Bank of India norms, a crop loan is considered as an NPA only if it remains in
default for at least two crop seasons. The loans for which I have data are all crop
loans, and a crop season is deﬁned as six months for rice, the underlying crop

17 The result excluding Karimnagar is presented in Table 14 in the Online Appendix.

for the sample of loans used in this study. The bank is required to signiﬁcantly
increase provisioning once an account is classiﬁed as an NPA, and, hence, the
NPA number is relevant from the point of view of bank proﬁtability. The average
NPA rate is nearly 27%, which is signiﬁcantly lower than the default rate. This
result shows that a large number of defaulters eventually repay. I estimate the
DID regression equation using loan status in terms of NPA as the dependent
variable.

Given the importance of NPAs described in Section 1.2.1, I proceed to test if
the microﬁnance regulation affected NPAs. For the purpose of this test, I deﬁne
affected loans as loans in default but not categorized as NPAs as of October
15, 2010. In line with the spirit of the earlier DID test, I consider loans whose
NPA due dates were immediately after (before) October 15, 2010, as affected
(unaffected) loans.

Univariate results presented in Table 3 show an increase in NPA rate in the
treatment regions in the post-intervention period when compared with the pre-
intervention period. No such increase is found in control regions. Formally,
I estimate regression Equation (1). Here, the dependent variable, NPA, is a
dummy variable that takes the value of one if the loan under consideration
becomes an NPA and zero otherwise. All other terms have the same meanings
as assigned in Equation (1).

The sample used here is not the same as that used in tests whose results
are reported in Table 4. Here, loans lent immediately after October 15, 2008,
form the treatment group, and loans lent immediately before that date form the
control group. These are loans lent close to two years before the event date.
Loans studied in Table 4 are lent close to one year before the event date.

The results are reported in Table 5. The arrangement of rows and columns
exactly mimics the arrangement in Table 4. The main explanatory variable that
I focus on, the interaction between the treatment dummy and affected loan
dummy, is positive in all columns and is statistically signiﬁcant. The NPA rate
seems to be higher based on the DID estimates by 18.7 to 30.2 percentage
points. Given that the average NPA rate in the sample is 27%, the increase
shown here is economically signiﬁcant.

Note also that

the increase in NPAs is signiﬁcantly higher than the
increase in the default rate. As I noted in Section 1.2.1, NPA recognition
leads to signiﬁcant negative consequences for banks, bankers, and borrowers.
Therefore, in the normal course, almost half the defaulters repay before their
loans are categorized as NPAs.18 If the microﬁnance intervention led to an
economic slowdown or an increase in strategic default in anticipation of future
interventions, then it is reasonable to expect that a large portion of defaulters

18 In Figure 7 presented in the Online Appendix, I plot the proportion of defaulted loans that are recovered before
being classiﬁed as NPAs against the time in default in the pre-event period. I ﬁnd that the proportion of loans
recovered increases as the due date for NPA classiﬁcation nears. However, given the data limitations, it is not
possible to disentangle the impact of loan ofﬁcers’ efforts from borrowers’ repayment on their own to avoid the
NPA tag.

In this table, I present the results of tests that examine the impact of the microﬁnance regulation on bank loan
NPAs. The data are organized at the loan level. In Columns 1 and 2, the data are limited to loans whose NPA
due dates are within the range of three months before and three months after October 15, 2010, that is, July 15,
2010, to January 15, 2011. In Columns 3 and 4, the data are limited to loans whose NPA due dates are within
the range of six months before and six months after October 15, 2010, that is, April 15, 2010, to April 15, 2011.
The dependent variable, NPA, is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the loan under consideration
turns into an NPA and zero otherwise. The explanatory variable, Andhra, is a dummy variable that takes the
value of one for loans made by branches located in Andhra Pradesh and zero otherwise. Affected Loans is also
a dummy variable that takes the value of one for loans whose NPA due dates are immediately after October 15,
2010. The main explanatory variable is the interaction between the above two variables. I use branch and month
ﬁxed effects in all columns, and I use loan-level and district-level economic variables as controls in Columns 2
and 4. Standard errors are clustered at the branch X month level and adjusted for heteroscedasticity. t-statistics
are presented inside parentheses. ***, **, and * represent statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,
respectively.

who would have repaid otherwise do not do so in the post-event period. It is
also reasonable to assume that both economic slowdown and spillover of moral
hazard are likely to impact past defaulters more than good borrowers.

4.3 Regression discontinuity test for loan performance
As noted earlier, the event nicely lends itself to an RD test as well. I perform
an RD test to examine the impact of the event on loan performance. I use
October 15, 2010, as the cutoff date and the distance of a loan’s due date from
October 15, 2010, as the running variable. I use a measure of loan performance
as the dependent variable. For tests that use NPA as the dependent variable, the
running variable is deﬁned as the distance of a loan’s due date for recognition
as an NPA from October 15, 2010. Essentially, like in Sections 4.1 and 4.2,
affected loans fall to the right of the cutoff, and unaffected loans fall to the left.
I use the method designed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014).
This method recognizes that routinely employed polynomial estimators are
extremely sensitive to speciﬁc bandwidths employed. Calonico, Cattaneo, and
Titiunik (2014) show that both conventional RD tests as well as recently
developed nonparametric local polynomial estimators make bandwidth choices
that lead to “bias in the distributional approximation of the estimator.” They
ﬁrst bias-correct the RD estimator by recentering the t-statistics. This step leads
to their bias-corrected estimators. They also recognize that this approximation
may lead to a “low-quality distributional approximation.” They devise a novel

method to calculate standard errors that account for the additional variability
introduced by the previous step. They call these standard errors robust standard
errors. I estimate both bias-corrected and robust RD estimators. I also report
conventional RD coefﬁcients.

All three estimates are from local linear regressions. The bias-corrected
and robust coefﬁcients differ from the conventional coefﬁcients due to the
application of bias correction procedure suggested in Calonico, Cattaneo, and
Titiunik (2014).19 The robust and bias-corrected coefﬁcients have the same
values, but their respective standard errors differ. Bandwidth selection is based
on Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2011). I use the results based on robust standard
errors for inference.

To absorb the impact of other related factors, I ﬁrst calculate the residuals
by employing branch and month ﬁxed effects. I exclude the main running
variable, distance, from the above regression. The dependent variable in this
ﬁrst-stage regression is a dummy variable that represents loan performance. The
residuals calculated in this way represent, as closely as possible, the impact of
the running variable on the dependent variable. I use these residuals as the
dependent variable in robust RD tests.

I report the results in panel A of Table 6. In Columns 1 and 2, I use the sample
of loans made by branches located in Andhra Pradesh. A dummy variable
representing default (NPA) is the dependent variable in Column 1 (2). Here, I
expect to see a sharp deterioration in loan performance immediately after the
cutoff. The results show an increase of 12.4 percentage points in the rate of
default and an increase of 24.5 percentage points in the NPA rate at the cutoff.
In Figures 5 and 6, I present the results of an RD regression wherein I use only
one stage and do not employ any control variable. In Figures 2 and 3 presented
in the Online Appendix, I depict the results of RD regressions wherein I adopt
a two-stage procedure by ﬁrst obtaining residuals. The regressions used are
local linear, and the bandwidth used is six months before and after the event in
terms of the due date. Regardless of the method used, I detect a pattern of sharp
deterioration in loan performance at the cutoff followed by a steady increase
in the default and NPA rates.

In Columns 3 and 4 of panel A of Table 6, I estimate the RD test using the
sample of loans from regions not affected by the event. As expected, I do not
ﬁnd any signiﬁcant increase in either the default rate (in Column 3) or the NPA
rate (in Column 4). From the above results, it is reasonable to conclude that
only the affected loans in treatment regions experience a sharp deterioration in
performance. The RD results corroborate the earlier results obtained through
DID tests.

As noted before, bandwidth selection is based on Imbens and Kalyanaraman
(2011). In the spirit of RD, and as a further robustness check, I limit the sample

This table reports the RD results for the impact of the microﬁnance regulation on loan performance. The data
are organized at the loan level. In Columns 1 and 2, I consider only Andhra Pradesh branches, and in Columns
3 and 4, I consider branches located in the other two states. The RD speciﬁcation estimates the signiﬁcance of
E[Yi (1)−Yi (0)|Xi = ¯x]. I use the procedure developed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) to estimate
robust and bias-corrected standard errors. The distance of a loan’s due date for default (due date for NPA) from
October 15, 2010, is the running variable in Columns 1 and 3 (2 and 4), and October 15, 2010, normalized to
zero, serves as the cutoff. Measures of loan performance as deﬁned in Tables 4 and 5 serve as dependent variables
in different speciﬁcations. I ﬁrst obtain the residuals of the regression of the dependent variable on branch and
month ﬁxed effects. I then use the residuals as the dependent variable in the RD test. In panel A, bandwidth
selection is based on the method devised by Imbens and Lemieux (2008). In panel B (C) I use the bandwidth of
three months (one month) on either side of the cutoff. ***, **, and * represent statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%,
5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

to loans having due dates within three months on either side of the cutoff date.
I report the results in panel B of Table 6. For an additional robustness check, I
limit the bandwidth to one month. Results with the one-month bandwidth are
reported in panel C.

In Columns 1 and 2 of both panels B and C, I restrict the sample to loans
lent by branches located in Andhra Pradesh. In line with the earlier results, I
ﬁnd a sharp discontinuity in loan performance immediately after the cutoff. In
non-Andhra Pradesh states, as shown in Columns 3 and 4, I do not observe
any signiﬁcant discontinuity. The number of observations sharply falls to 66

in default in a quarter is the variable of interest plotted in the vertical axis. Quarter −1 (−2) refers to a period
between 1 and 90 (90 and 180) days before the event date. Quarter 1 (2) refers to a period between 1 and 90 (90
and 180) days after the event date.

in Column 3 of panel C. Therefore, I do not use bandwidths closer than one
month.

4.4 Appropriateness of the methodology
4.4.1 Parallel trend. A crucial prerequisite for the validity of the DID method
is the existence of a parallel trend in the pre-event period with respect to the
outcome of interest (Bertrand, Duﬂo, and Mullainathan 2004). I check for the
existence of a parallel trend in two ways.

4.4.2 Parallel trend using raw default data. First, in Figure 3, I plot the
default rates over time. I expect to see a parallel trend in default rates between
Andhra Pradesh-based branches and branches located in other states for loans
having due dates just before the event date.

These are unconditional numbers derived using raw data. The blue line
represents loans lent by Andhra Pradesh branches, and the red line represents
loans lent by branches located in the other two states. Each point in the
horizontal axis represents a quarter. Quarter 1 (2) refers to the period between
0 and 90 (90 and 180) days after the event date. Similarly, quarter -1 (-2) refers
to the period between 0 and 90 (90 and 180) days before the event date. A loan
that has a due date in a quarter is associated with that quarter. Default rate is the
ratio between the number of loans in default and the total number of loans due
in a quarter. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, the default rates in the two quarters

before the event move almost in parallel. The line representing the treatment
region breaks out from quarter 1 and continues its upward movement in quarter
2 as well. On the other hand, the line representing the control regions does not
show any signiﬁcant directional movement in the post-event period. Moreover,
notice that the difference between the default rates of Andhra Pradesh (treatment
region) and the other two states (control regions) in the pre-event period ranges
from -2% to -3%, and the same during the post-event period ranges from 15%
to 18%. These numbers are broadly in line with the DID coefﬁcient values
presented in Table 4. In Figure 1 presented in the Online Appendix, I plot the
default rates at monthly frequency by limiting the sample to three months before
and after the event. The ﬁgure shows a parallel trend between the treatment and
control regions during the pre-event period.

4.4.3 Parallel trend using a simple regression framework. Following,
Following, Barrot (2016), I break the pre-period into subperiods. I then interact
each subperiod with the treatment dummy.
I estimate the following regression equation:
Yitj = αitj +β1×Andhraij ×Pre-Period=−3

+β2×Andhraij ×Pre-Period=−2+β3×Andhraij ×Pre-Period=−1
+β4×Andhraij ×Post-Periodit +β5×Monthit +β6×Branchij
+β6×Xitj +β7∗Dtj +ij t .

The data are organized at the level of a loan i. The dependent variable is a
dummy variable that takes the value of one if loan i with a due date in a quarter
t and made by a branch j defaults and zero otherwise. I report the results in
Table 7. Each observation is a loan. The sample period spans three (six) months
before and after the event date in Columns 1 and 2 (3 and 4). The Post-period is
a dummy variable that takes the value of one for loans having due dates after the
event date. In Columns 1 and 2, Pre-period 3 is a dummy variable that takes the
value of one for loans having due dates between 61 and 90 days before the event
date. Similarly, Pre-period=2 (Pre-period=1) is a dummy variable that takes
the value of one for loans having due dates between 31 and 60 (1 and 30) days
before the event date. In Columns 3 and 4, the pre-period is counted in quarters.
Pre-period=2 (Pre-period=1) is a dummy variable that takes the value of one
for loans having due dates between 1 and 90 (91 and 180) days before the event
date. Andhra is a dummy variable that takes the value of one for loans lent
by Andhra Pradesh-based branches and zero otherwise. The main explanatory
variables of interest are the interaction terms between the pre-periods and the
Andhra dummy.

If a parallel trend exists between the treatment and control regions, I expect
the interaction between the pre-event period dummies and treatment region to
be statistically indistinguishable from zero. As expected, all the pre-period

In this table, I present the results of tests that examine the impact of the microﬁnance regulation on bank loan
defaults. Speciﬁcally, I test if any pre-trend exists. Each observation is a loan. The sample period spans three (six
months) before and after the event date in Columns 1 and 2 (3 and 4). The Post-period is a dummy variable that
takes the value of one for loans having due dates after the event date. In Columns 1 and 2, Pre-period 3 is a dummy
variable that takes the value of one for loans having due dates between 61 and 90 days before the event date and
zero otherwise. Similarly, Pre-period=2 (Pre-period=1) is a dummy variable that takes the value of one for loans
having due dates between 31 and 60 (1 and 30) days before the event date and zero otherwise. In Columns 3 and
4, the pre-period is counted in quarters. Pre-period=2 (Pre-period=1) is a dummy variable that takes the value
of one for loans having due dates between 1 and 90 (91 and 180) days before the event date and zero otherwise.
The dependent variable, default, is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the loan under consideration
defaults and zero otherwise. The explanatory variable, Andhra, is a dummy variable that takes the value of one
for loans made by branches located in Andhra Pradesh and zero otherwise. Standard errors are clustered at the
branch X month level and adjusted for heteroscedasticity. t-statistics are presented inside parentheses. ***, **,
and * represent statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

interaction terms are statistically indistinguishable from zero. Expectedly,
interaction between the Post-Period dummy and the Andhra dummy indicates
an increase in the default rate in the post-event period in a DID sense.

The results from comparing the default rate using raw data and from
estimating the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression equation in line with
Barrot (2016) help us address the concern regarding pre-trends inﬂuencing the
results.

4.4.4 Validity of the regression discontinuity: McCrary test. For the RD
design to be valid, it is important to rule out the possibility of bunching around
the cutoff, plausibly in anticipation of the event (Imbens and Lemieux 2008). I
perform the test prescribed by McCrary (2008) to see whether bunching around
the cutoff exists. I depict the results in Figure 4. There is no evidence of any
signiﬁcant bunching around the cutoff.

As noted in Section 4.3, there are differences between the samples used in
RD tests that use NPA classiﬁcation as the dependent variable and those that
use default as the dependent variable. Therefore, I perform the McCrary (2008)
test using the sample used for the NPA test. I report the results in Figure 6

presented in the Online Appendix. I do not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant bunching close
to the cutoff.20

4.5 Placebo tests
To address any residual concerns regarding the existence of pre-trends, I
perform several placebo tests. I ﬁrst estimate the DID regression Equation (1)
using placebo event dates. I report the results in Table 7 presented in the Online
Appendix. I consider October 15, 2009 (October 15, 2008), as the placebo
event date in Columns 1 to 4 (Columns 5 to 8). All variables have the same
meanings like in Equation (1). As before, I focus on the interaction between the
treatment region dummy and the affected loan dummy. As shown in the table,
the interaction term is statistically insigniﬁcant in all eight columns. I perform
another set of placebo tests using the RD design and ﬁnd similar results. Here,
I use 12 placebo event dates. I use the 15th of every month from September
2010 to October 2009 as placebo event dates. I report these results in Table 8
presented in the Online Appendix. I do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant jump at the cutoff
after any placebo event date. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the

20 A large-scale national-level debt waiver was awarded in February 2008 and executed by the end of June 2008. I
restrict the sample to loans lent after the waiver in both the above tests. This explains the difference in bandwidths
in Figure 4 of the main draft and Figure 6 of the Online Appendix.

Figure 5
RD plot: Impact on default
This ﬁgure depicts the results of the RD test that examines the impact of the event on loan default rates in the
treatment region. I use the method designed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014). I use October 15, 2010,
as the cutoff date and the distance of a loan’s due date for default from October 15, 2010, as the running variable.
The RD test uses local linear regression. The economic magnitude of the discontinuity is 25.2 percentage points.

phenomenon I detect in this study is not an event that occurs every year after
October 15 or every month after the 15th day.

4.6 Addressing identiﬁcation concerns and external validity
I perform a series of robustness tests to ameliorate the concern that the results
are driven by some other correlated shock that affected only Andhra Pradesh.
A careful reading of local newspapers and ofﬁcial gazettes of the three state
governments under consideration does not reveal the existence of any such
shock. Nonetheless, to rule out any residual concerns, I perform additional
tests.

4.6.1 Close branch test. All bank branches I study are located close to the
borders of the respective states. I further tighten identiﬁcation by limiting
the sample to branches that are closest to each other on either side of the
border. I include branches located in the Mahbubnagar and Medak districts
of Andhra Pradesh, the Raichur district of Karnataka, and the Nanded district
of Maharashtra. Mahbubnagar district shares its borders with Raichur district
of Karnataka, and Medak district shares its border with Nanded district of
Maharashtra.

Figure 6
RD plot: Impact on NPA
This ﬁgure depicts the results of the RD test that examines the impact of the event on loan NPA rates in the
treatment region. I use the method designed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014). I use October 15, 2010,
as the cutoff date and the distance of a loan’s due date for NPA from October 15, 2010, as the running variable.
The RD test uses local linear regression. The economic magnitude of the discontinuity is 13.7 percentage points.

I estimate the DID regression Equation (1) using the above sample of nearby
branches and report the results in Columns 1 to 4 of Table 8. The arrangement of
rows and columns exactly mimics that of Table 4. In line with the earlier results
that use the entire sample, I ﬁnd that the loan default rate increases by between
22.4 to 33.6 percentage points. The economic magnitude of the coefﬁcients of
interest is slightly higher than what I ﬁnd using the entire sample. However,
in one of the four speciﬁcations, the coefﬁcient of interest narrowly misses
the conventional signiﬁcance level of 10%. I repeat the tests using the entire
sample, like in Table 4, and control for the distance from each branch to the
Andhra Pradesh border. The results remain materially unchanged. I report these
results in Columns 3 and 4 of Table 14 presented in the Online Appendix.

4.6.2 External validity: Impact on banks highly exposed to Andhra
Pradesh. Admittedly, all the sample loans are made by a single government-
owned bank. This fact raises a concern that the results could be driven
by features peculiar to government-owned banks. However, I exploit the
differences between branches of the same government-owned bank located
in areas that received the treatment and branches located in other areas.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the results are caused by peculiar government

In this table, I present the results of tests that examine the impact of the microﬁnance regulation on bank loan
defaults. I restrict the sample to branches that are close to each other on either side of the border. The data are
organized at the loan level. In Columns 1 and 2, the data are limited to loans whose due dates are within the range
of three months before and three months after October 15, 2010, that is, July 15, 2010, to January 15, 2011. In
Columns 3 and 4, the data are limited to loans whose due dates are within the range of six months before and
six months after October 15, 2010, that is, April 15, 2010, to April 15, 2011. The dependent variable, default, is
a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the loan under consideration defaults and zero otherwise. The
explanatory variable, Andhra loans, is a dummy variable that takes the value of one for loans made by branches
located in Andhra Pradesh and zero otherwise. Affected loans is also a dummy variable that takes the value of one
for loans having due dates immediately after the event date and zero otherwise. The main explanatory variable
is the interaction between the above two variables. I use branch and month ﬁxed effects in all columns, and I use
loan-level and district-level economic variables as controls in Columns 2 and 4. Standard errors are clustered at
the branch X month level and adjusted for heteroscedasticity. t-statistics are presented inside parentheses. ***,
**, and * represent statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

bank characteristics. Nonetheless, to address any residual concerns, I collect
data relating to the delinquency rates of all listed banks in India for the period
between 2008 and 2011. I obtain these data from the website of the Reserve
Bank of India, the Indian central bank. The choice of sample period is dictated
by the availability of the data. The data set includes 39 banks in total, of which,
23 are government owned and 16 are privately owned.

I estimate the following regression equation.

Yitj = αitj +β1×Exposure to Andhrai×Postit
+β2∗Exposure to Andhrai +β3∗Postit
+β4∗Publici +β5∗Xitj +ij .

(3)

Here, the data are organized at the bank-year level. The dependent variable
is the ratio between the value of delinquent loans and that of total loans at
the bank-year level. Exposure to Andhra is the ratio between the number of
branches of a bank located in Andhra Pradesh and total number of branches at
the beginning of the ﬁnancial year 2010. Post is a dummy variable that takes
the value of one for loans made in the year 2011 and zero otherwise. Public is
a dummy variable that takes the value of one for government-owned banks and
zero otherwise. Standard errors are clustered at the bank level and adjusted for
heteroscedasticity. I focus on the interaction between the Exposure To Andhra
and the Post variables.

level of exposure of a bank to Andhra Pradesh state by using the ratio of the number of bank branches located in
Andhra Pradesh and total number of branches as of the beginning of the year 2010. This ratio is the independent
variable, exposure. Post is a dummy variable that takes the value of one for years after the intervention and
zero otherwise. Public is a dummy variable that takes the value of one for government-owned banks and zero
otherwise. The main independent variable is the interaction between post and exposure. I include year ﬁxed effects
in all columns. In Column 4, I include bank ﬁxed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the bank level and
adjusted for heteroscedasticity. t-statistics are presented inside parentheses. ***, **, and * represent statistical
signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

The results are reported in Table 9. In Column 1, I include only year ﬁxed
effects and ﬁnd that banks with high exposure to Andhra Pradesh experience
higher delinquency in the post-intervention period. In Column 2, I include
the P ublic dummy, which absorbs time-invariant factors common to public
sector banks. In Column 3, along with the P ublic dummy, I also include
the P ublicXP ost variable, which absorbs any shock to public sector banks
that is correlated with the microﬁnance intervention. Finally, in Column 4, I
include bank and year ﬁxed effects. Regardless of the speciﬁcation used, I ﬁnd
that banks with high exposure to Andhra Pradesh experience a higher default
rate in the post-micro-ﬁnance-intervention period. The variables P ublic and
P ublicXP ost ensure that the phenomenon detected is not driven by factors
peculiar to government-owned banks.

As a further robustness test, I check whether the impact is any different
between government-owned and private banks by including a triple interaction
between Exposure To Andhra, P ost, and P ublic. I report the results in Table 12
presented in the Online Appendix. As shown in the table, the triple interaction
is statistically insigniﬁcant. There does not seem to be a signiﬁcant difference
between government-owned and private banks in terms of borrower response.

This table reports the RD results regarding the impact of the debt waiver program of 2008 on loan performance
of nonbeneﬁciaries. The data are organized at the loan level. The sample is drawn from all 14 branches. The RD
speciﬁcation estimates the signiﬁcance of E[Yi (1)−Yi (0)|Xi = ¯x]. I use the procedure developed by Calonico,
Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) to estimate robust and bias-corrected standard errors. In Columns 1 and 2, the
distance of a loan’s due date for default from February 29, 2008, is the running variable, and February 29, 2008,
normalized to zero, serves as the cutoff. I use the placebo cutoff date of February 28, 2007, in Columns 3 and 4.
Measures of loan performance as deﬁned in Tables 4 and 5 serve as dependent variables in different speciﬁcations.
I ﬁrst obtain the residuals of the regression of the dependent variable on branch and month ﬁxed effects. I then
use these residuals as the dependent variable in the RD test. t-statistics are presented inside parentheses. ***, **,
and * represent statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

defaulters announced in the year 2008.21 Crucially, to obtain waiver beneﬁts, it
was stipulated that a borrower should have defaulted on or before December 31,
2007, a full two months before the waiver. Several studies (Kanz 2015, De and
Tantri 2014) that examine the program ﬁnd that the program led to signiﬁcant
moral hazard in loan repayment among the beneﬁciaries. Given the ﬁndings
using the microﬁnance event, I hypothesize that even the nonbeneﬁciaries are
likely to default more.

I test the above hypothesis using the regression discontinuity framework
described in Section 4.3 on a sample of nonbeneﬁciaries. The waiver was
announced on February 29, 2008. In the RD tests, I compare nonbeneﬁciary
borrowers having due dates immediately prior to February 29, 2008 (“affected
borrowers”) with those having due dates immediately after February 29, 2008
(“notaffected borrowers”). As before, both categories of loans were lent before
the announcement of the waiver. The event date, February 29, 2008, is the
cutoff, and the distance of a loan’s due date from the cutoff is the running
variable.

As a prerequisite to the RD test, I perform the test recommended by McCrary
(2008) and report the results in Figure 5 presented in the Online Appendix. I do
not detect any signiﬁcant bunching at the cutoff. I then perform the RD test and
report the results in Table 10. The data are organized at the loan level. The data
belong to all 14 branches located in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
and Maharashtra.

21 The waiver was awarded to past defaulters. Those with a landholding of less than 2 hectares received full waiver.
Defaulters with a landholding of more than 2 hectares received only a partial waiver, which was limited to 25%
of the total debt owed.

Contagious Effects of a Political Intervention in Debt Contracts

In Column 1, the dependent variable is the default dummy. As reported in
the Table, I ﬁnd that the default rate of waiver nonbeneﬁciaries having due
dates after the waiver is 34.2 percentage points higher than that of comparable
nonbeneﬁciaries having due dates just before the waiver. In Column 2, I use NPA
status as the dependent variable and ﬁnd similar results. Here, the economic
magnitude of the discontinuity is 24.1 percentage points.22 Finally, I perform
placebo tests by using February 28, 2007, as the placebo event date and report
the results in Columns 3 and 4 of Table 10. I do not detect any signiﬁcant jump
at the cutoff in these tests. These results support the thesis that the impact of
the waiver spills over to nonbeneﬁciaries.

I present the above ﬁndings as part of the robustness exercise and not as the
main results. This is because the waiver of 2008 was a nationwide program, and,
hence, unlike in the case of the microﬁnance event, wherein I use the border
regions of non-Andhra Pradesh states to calculate the counterfactual difference,
it is very difﬁcult to obtain the counterfactual difference.

4.6.4 Other robustness tests.
I perform several other robustness tests to
address any residual concerns. First, there could be a concern that the results are
driven by an unobserved economic shock that is not related to the microﬁnance
event but moved in tandem with it. The close branch test, whose results
are reported in Section 4.6.1, helps in addressing this concern substantially.
Nonetheless, as a further robustness check, using a separate within-Andhra
Pradesh loan-level dataset, I ﬁnd that the deterioration in loan performance is
limited to types of loans that are known to be subject to political intervention
(Cole 2009b). A general economic shock is likely to impact all sectors and
not just sectors where the chances of political intervention are high. I describe
these results in Section 1 of the Online Appendix and report the same in Table 1
presented in the Online Appendix. Second, I test and ﬁnd that the deterioration
in loan performance is higher in regions having high microﬁnance coverage
before the event. I describe these results in Section 1.3 of the Online Appendix
and report the same in Table 3 presented in the Online Appendix.

5. Flow of Bank Credit After the Event

5.1 Impact on Andhra Pradesh branches
In the second part of the study, I focus on loan ofﬁcers’ (banks’) responses to
deterioration in loan performance. I examine the impact of the intervention on
the ﬂow of credit. An important caveat that needs to be mentioned at this stage

22 I cannot perform a test using the NPA due date as the cut-off as in Section 4.3. In other words, I cannot use the
sample of borrowers whose due dates for recognition of NPA fall on either side of the cutoff date of February 29,
2008. This is because defaulting borrowers are eligible for the waiver regardless of whether or not their loans were
classiﬁed as NPAs as on February 29, 2008. Therefore, I do not have a category of defaulting nonbeneﬁciaries
whose loans are close to be classiﬁed as NPAs. Thus, I test for the long-term impact using the due date for default
as the cutoff and NPA status as the dependent variable.

This table reports the RD results regarding the impact of the microﬁnance regulation on the daily loan amount
disbursed by the bank. The RD speciﬁcation estimates the signiﬁcance of E[Yi (1)−Yi (0)|Xi = ¯x]. I use the
procedure developed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) to estimate robust and bias-corrected standard
errors. The distance from October 15, 2010, is the running variable, and October 15, 2010, normalized to zero,
serves as the cutoff. The dependent variable, Loan Amount, is the natural logarithm of the daily loan amount.
I ﬁrst obtain the residuals of the regression of the dependent variable on branch and month ﬁxed effects. I then
use these residuals as the dependent variable in the RD test. Loans made by the Andhra Pradesh branches are
covered in Columns 1 and 2. Loans made by branches located in the other two states are covered in Columns
3 and 4. t-statistics are presented inside parentheses. ***, **, and * represent statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%,
5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

is that I observe only equilibrium outcomes in the post-intervention period and,
hence, are unable to fully disentangle demand and supply effects. A second
crucial difference between this part of the study and the previous part is that,
in the previous part, the treatment loans had already been provided when
the regulation was issued. In this part, I look at new loans issued after the
announcement of the intervention.

The RD setup is similar to the one used in Section 4.3. The dependent variable
is the natural logarithm of the daily value of loans made at the branch level. An
observation represents a branch-day.

As before, I use the robust RD framework developed by Calonico, Cattaneo,
and Titiunik (2014). To absorb the impact of other time-invariant and time-
varying factors, I ﬁrst calculate the residuals from a regression of the daily
loan amount on branch and month ﬁxed effects. I exclude the main running
variable, distance, from the above regression. The residuals calculated in this
way represent, as closely as possible, the impact of the running variable on the
dependent variable. I use these residuals as the dependent variable in robust RD
tests. I estimate the RD tests separately for the treatment and control regions.
The results are reported in Table 11. In Columns 1 and 2, I perform RD
tests using loans made by the Andhra Pradesh branches. In Column 1, I include
branch and month ﬁxed effects in the ﬁrst stage, whereas in Column 2, I include
other loan-level and district-level covariates. The daily loan amount is lower
by 47.9% to 54.8% as one crosses the discontinuity from left to right. In other
words, the daily loan amount falls by nearly half immediately after the issue of
the notiﬁcation. This result is depicted in Figure 7. Notice a sharp fall around
the cutoff. From the ﬁgure, it appears that the supply of credit did not recover
to previous levels even six months after the event date.

Figure 7
RD plot: Impact on lending-intensive margin
This ﬁgure depicts the results of the RD test that examines the impact of the event on the quantity of loans made
in the treatment region. I use the method designed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014). I use October 15,
2010, as the cutoff date and the distance of the day under consideration from October 15, 2010, as the running
variable. To absorb the impact of other related factors, I ﬁrst calculate the residuals by employing branch and
month ﬁxed effects. I exclude the main running variable, distance, from the above regression. The dependent
variable in this ﬁrst-stage regression is the natural logarithm of the value of loans made at a branch-day level. I
use the residuals as the dependent variable in robust RD tests.

A sudden and discontinuous decrease in bank credit immediately after
the event indicates that the results could be driven more by supply than by
demand. As discussed before, the demand side effects, if any, are likely to take
time to manifest. However, it is not possible to fully rule out demand-based
explanations.

5.2 Impact on branches located in neighboring states
To rule out the possibility that the results presented in Section 5.1 are the
result of a common economic shock other than the microﬁnance intervention, I
conduct RD tests on the sample of loans from branches that are located outside
Andhra Pradesh but close to the Andhra Pradesh border. All other details about
the speciﬁcations used remain the same as before. The results are reported in
Columns 3 and 4 of Table 11. As reported in the table, I do not observe any
signiﬁcant discontinuity at the cutoff. Thus, there is unlikely to be any other
shock working in tandem with the microﬁnance intervention.

6. Discussion

The results presented so far indicate that deterioration in loan performance and
reduction in the ﬂow of credit are a result of the microﬁnance intervention.
The chances of these results being caused by some other factor are remote.
In one of the robustness tests reported in Section 4.6.1, I compare branches
located in districts that are very close to each other and ﬁnd that the results
continue to hold. It is unlikely that an economic shock from a source other than
the microﬁnance intervention discussed in this paper would hit one side of the
border and not the other side. Second, a careful newspaper search around the
event did not ﬁnd reports of any other economic shock hitting only Andhra
Pradesh during October 2010.

I now discuss the plausible mechanisms through which the spillover effects
could have spread. One possibility is that the curtailment of microﬁnance loans
created economic distress in Andhra Pradesh (Breza and Kinnan 2016), and this
distress in turn led to increased bank loan defaults. Suppose a farmer borrows
from both a bank and a microﬁnance institution; if microﬁnance loans are
suddenly cut off, the farmer may experience distress. Farmers may not have
sufﬁcient funds to invest in critical inputs, and, hence, their production may
suffer. This may lead to a situation wherein the farmer is forced to default on
bank loans as well. However, it is likely that the impact of credit constraints will
take some time before the real outcomes manifest. However, I see an immediate
increase in the default rate after October 15, 2010. Therefore, the real impact
of the curtailment of microﬁnance credit is unlikely to explain the results of
this study fully.

Another plausible channel is a change in bank borrowers’ behavior in
anticipation of government
intervention in bank loans as well. Political
intervention in bank loan contracts is quite common in emerging economies
(Cole 2009b; Gine and Kanz 2017; Khwaja and Mian 2005; Mukherjee,
Subramanian, and Tantri 2014). It is possible that borrowers considered the
microﬁnance intervention as a signal regarding the government type and,
hence, expected further intervention in bank loans. In addition, the effects of
this channel are likely to manifest quickly. Borrowers who are on the verge
of repaying their loans could stop repayment as soon as they learn about
the intervention and understand its implications. Although this explanation
certainly seems plausible, I are unable to test it given data limitations. It is
difﬁcult to detect strategic default in the absence of a survey. Even with a
survey, there is no guarantee that participants will reveal their true intentions.
The moral hazard is likely to manifest quickly, while the indirect impact of
economic distress caused by the virtual shutdown of microﬁnance is likely to
manifest with a lag. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the results are more
in line with the moral hazard argument than with the demand-side economic
distress argument. At least a part of the result is caused by increased expectation
of future political intervention in bank loans and change in borrower behavior

Contagious Effects of a Political Intervention in Debt Contracts

in anticipation. However, it is difﬁcult to disentangle the impact of increased
expectations of the government intervention and change in borrower behavior.
Loan performance is likely to deteriorate if both occur simultaneously.

This discussion also applies to the second part of the study, wherein I attempt
to identify bank response in terms of subsequent credit. From the results
presented in Section 5 and timing of the response, it appears reasonable to
infer that the decline in credit is a supply response in anticipation of bad loan
performance. It is also possible that loan ofﬁcers resort to ever-greening of loans
in order to limit the damage to their appraisal scores. Tantri (2017) shows that
ever-greening, as identiﬁed by their measure, increased in Andhra Pradesh after
the microﬁnance intervention. The purpose of ever-greening is to show lower
defaults, and hence a discontinuous increase in ever-greening could understate
the actual deterioration in loan performance and actual reduction in the ﬂow of
credit. Ever-greening also involves granting of ﬁctitious loans to show that the
previous loans have been repaid and new loans have been issued. Therefore,
an increase in ever-greening also implies an overstatement of actual new credit
lent. This suggests that, in reality, the ﬂow of credit could have declined more
than what I show in this study.

7. Conclusion

In this study, I ask if a political intervention in debt contracts in one segment
of the credit market becomes contagious, thereby negatively affecting other
segments of the credit market as well. The empirical setting for this study is
provided by a sudden order issued by one Indian state government on October
15, 2010. The order imposed severe restrictions on the loan recovery processes
to be followed by microﬁnance institutions. This sudden action was driven by
media reports of suicides committed by microﬁnance borrowers, allegedly due
to harsh recovery practices followed by the lenders. Using proprietary loan-level
data provided to us by a bank, I test the implications of this intervention on the
repayment of bank loans. I use a sample of loans made by bank branches situated
outside Andhra Pradesh but close to its border to assess the counterfactual.

I ﬁnd that bank loans made by Andhra Pradesh branches that were
outstanding but not overdue as on October 15, 2010, defaulted signiﬁcantly
more when compared with similar loans made by other comparable branches
of the same bank located outside Andhra Pradesh. I establish the results using
the DID and RD methods. In the second part of the study, I look at the impact
on new loans made after the intervention. I detect a sharp decline of about 54%
in the average daily value of loans lent by Andhra Pradesh-based branches. I
attribute this to the rational anticipation of adverse loan performance by loan
ofﬁcers. It appears that political intervention in the microﬁnance segment of
the credit market adversely affected bank loans because of spillover effects.

This study points out an important cost of political intervention in debt
contracts. By costs, I mean the increased default rate on bank loans and

reduction in the ﬂow of credit. Policymakers are likely to weigh in costs and
beneﬁts of an intervention such as the one examined in this study. I point out
that it is not sufﬁcient to only factor in the impact on borrowers who deal with
the segment of the credit market that is likely to be subject to an intervention.
As I show in this study, borrowers who deal with other segments of the credit
market may also be affected by the intervention. Depending on the strength of
the intervention and linkages, the spillover impact may vary. Therefore, it is
advisable that policymakers consider the contagious effect pointed out in this
study before designing any such intervention.
