We study how technological shocks to the cost of starting new businesses have led the 
venture capital model to adapt in fundamental ways over the prior decade. We both doc- 
ument and provide a framework to understand the changes in the investment strategy of 
venture capitalists (VCs) in recent years – an increased prevalence of a “spray and pray”
investment approach – where investors provide a little funding and limited governance 
to an increased number of startups that they are more likely to abandon, but where ini- 
tial experiments signiﬁcantly inform beliefs about the future potential of the venture. This 
adaptation and related entry by new ﬁnancial intermediaries has led to a disproportionate 
rise in innovations where information on future prospects is revealed quickly and cheaply, 
and reduced the relative share of innovation in complex technologies where initial exper- 
iments cost more and reveal less.

1. Introduction 

Although  technological  change  is  increasingly  seen  as 
the  primary  driver  of  productivity  growth  ( Aghion  and 
Howitt, 1992 ), adaptation by ﬁnancial intermediaries may 
be equally important to realizing the beneﬁts of these new 
technologies ( King and Levine, 1993; Laeven et al., 2015 ). 
For example, Chandler (1965) documents the adaptation by 
specialized  investment  banks  as  a  response  to  the  “vast 
sums  of  capital” required  to  ﬁnance  the  construction  of 
railroads and govern industrial corporations needing arm’s-

length  capital  from  distant  investors. 
(2016) shows how the modern venture capital model arose 
in the mid-20th century in order to channel capital to the 
myriad new technologies emerging outside of the corpo- 
rate research and development (R&D) model.

We  provide  evidence  that  the  venture  capital  invest- 
ment  model  has  evolved  in  fundamental  ways  over  the 
last  decade,  particularly  in  the  early  stage  ﬁnancing  of 
software and service oriented startup ventures. For these 
sectors,  we  document  an  increased  prevalence  of  an  in- 
vestment  strategy  that  has  been  colloquially  referred  to 
as  “spray  and  pray,” where  early  stage  investors  provide 
a  little  funding  and  limited  governance  to  an  increased 
number  of  startups,  most  of  which  they  abandon  after 
their initial investment. The “spray and pray” investment 
approach  is  a  signiﬁcant  shift  away  from  the  traditional 
value-added ‘governance’ in the early stages of a venture’s 
life and is particularly signiﬁcant because venture capital 
investors are not just passive, but typically play a central 
role in monitoring and governing new ventures through a 
successful exit ( Hellmann and Puri, 20 0 0; Sorensen, 20 07 ). 
We argue that this change in the investment strategy 
of early stage investors has been driven by technological 
shocks that have substantially lowered the cost of starting 
new businesses, opening up a whole new range of invest- 
ment opportunities that were not viable before, but also 
necessitating new ways of ﬁnancing them. To understand 
the need for this adaptation by early stage investors, it is 
helpful to recognize that a key feature of the venture cap- 
ital context is a combination of extremely skewed ex post 
returns  and  an  inability  to  tell  the  biggest  successes  ex 
ante  ( Hall  and Woodward,  2010;  Kerr  et  al.,  2014b ).  VCs 
therefore  stage  their  investment  across  multiple  rounds, 
and each round of investment can be seen as an experi- 
ment that generates information about the ultimate value 
of the startup. Critically, staging also allows VCs to aban- 
don their investment if intermediate information is nega- 
tive,  so  that  each  investment  stage  is  akin  to  a  real  op- 
tion ( Gompers, 1995; Cornelli and Yosha, 2003; Bergemann 
and Hege, 2005; Fluck et al., 2007; Bergemann et al., 2008; 
Tian, 2011 ). From a theoretical perspective, therefore, the 
falling cost of starting ﬁrms has a ﬁrst-order effect on the 
value of these real options. We provide a simple theoreti- 
cal framework to highlight how the falling cost of starting 
ﬁrms can alter the way VCs select and govern their port- 
folio of investments due to the higher value of these aban- 
donment options. 

Our paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of 
how the changing cost of starting new ventures has im- 
pacted venture-capital backed entrepreneurship in the US. 
While  anecdotal  accounts  of  this  phenomenon  and  the 
changes in the market  for early  stage ﬁnance have been 
documented  in the  press (e.g.,  Economist,  2014 ) and the 
managerial  implications  popularized  in  frameworks  such 
as the “lean startup model,” we are not aware of any sys- 
tematic work examining how the changing cost of start- 
ing  businesses  impacts  the  early  stage  ﬁnancing  market. 
Our approach combines rich data on the investments and 
composition of venture capital portfolios with a theoretical 
framework that emphasizes a core mechanism driving our 
ﬁndings. 

We begin by providing evidence of a changing invest- 
ment approach by VCs following the advent of Amazon’s 
Web  Services  (AWS)  in  early  2006.  The  introduction  of 
cloud  computing  services  by  Amazon  is  seen  by  many 
practitioners as a deﬁning moment that dramatically low- 

ered  the  initial  cost  of  starting  Internet  and  web-based 
startups. Cloud computing allowed startups to ‘rent’ hard- 
ware space in small increments and scale up as demand 
grew, instead of making large ﬁxed upfront investments in 
hardware when the probability of success for the startup 
was  still  extremely  low.  This  allowed  entrepreneurs  and 
investors  to  learn  about  the  viability  of  startups  before 
making  large  ﬁxed  investments,  and  hence  can  be  seen 
as lowering the  costs  of initial experiments. Importantly, 
this technological shock impacted only a subset of ﬁrms. 
The  cloud  services  provided  by  AWS  provided  scalable 
bandwidth, storage, and computing resources for compa- 
nies  with  a  strong  online  presence  such  as  software-as- 
a-service, social networks, or retail e-commerce websites. 
This cross-sectional variation in the changing cost of start- 
ing ﬁrms allows us to systematically document our ﬁnd- 
ings in a differences-in-differences framework. 

We  show  that  subsequent  to  the  shock,  startups 
founded in sectors beneﬁting most from the introduction 
of AWS raised signiﬁcantly smaller amounts in their ﬁrst 
round of VC ﬁnancing. On average, initial funding size fell 
20%,  but  quantile  regressions  demonstrate  that  this  fall 
was  across  the  board  and  even  larger  for  many  parts  of 
the funding-size distribution. Importantly, we ﬁnd that the 
fall is  conﬁned to  initial startup costs. While startups in 
treated sectors raised less capital in their initial two years, 
total capital raised by ﬁrms in treated sectors that survived 
three or more years was unchanged. This is consistent with 
the notion that the primary effect that AWS had was on 
the initial fundraising by startups rather than on the cost 
of running the business at scale – effectively allowing star- 
tups to shift their large capital investments to later stages 
when uncertainty had been resolved. 

We turn next to showing how this fall in the cost of 
starting businesses impacted the way in which VCs man- 
aged  their  portfolios.  We  show  that  in  sectors  impacted 
by  the  technological  shock,  VCs  responded  by  providing 
a  little  funding  and  limited  governance  to  an  increased 
number  of  startups,  which  they  were  more  likely  to 
abandon after the initial round of funding. The number of 
initial investments made per year by VCs in treated sectors 
nearly doubled from the pre- to the post-period, without 
a  commensurate  increase  in  follow-on  investments,  and 
VCs  making  initial  investments  in  treated  sectors  were 
less likely to take a board seat following the technological 
shock. In a reference to the large number of startups that 
receive  an  initial  investment,  the  lower  governance,  and 
the smaller proportion of ventures that receive follow-on 
funding, this investment approach is colloquially referred 
2 
to as one where investors “spray and pray”. 

Our  ﬁndings  are  consistent  with  anecdotal  accounts 
of  entry  by  several  new  ﬁnancial  intermediaries  such  as 
‘Micro-VCs’ and ‘Super Angels’ who specialize in early stage 

2 This “spray and pray” investment strategy is typiﬁed by a quote from 
Naval Ravikant, a prominent angel investor and founder of the platform 
AngelList, who noted that “making an [early stage] investment is like 
throwing darts in the dark.” Source: Fatima Yasmine, February 22, 2011,

3  However, 
investing  using  such  an  investment  approach. 
the inclusion of VC ﬁxed effects in our regressions shows 
that this was not just a compositional shift in the types of 
investors before and after the shock – VCs who were active 
in  the  pre-period were also  involved in  deals  where the 
initial funding size had fallen relative to their own deals in 
untreated sectors. Moreover, VCs who were active investors 
in  the  pre-period  were  more  likely  to  invest  through  a 
spray  and  pray  investment  strategy  in  sectors  that  ben- 
eﬁted  from  the  technological  shock.  As  noted  above,  the 
“spray and pray” investment approach is a signiﬁcant shift 
away from value-added ‘governance’ in the early stages of 
ventures to more passive ‘learning’ about startup potential. 
The  falling  cost  of  starting  new  businesses  allowed  a 
set  of  entrepreneurs who  would  not  have  been  ﬁnanced 
in  the  past  to  receive  early  stage  ﬁnancing.  While  these 
marginal ventures that just became viable had lower ex- 
pected value, they seemed to be largely comprised of ven- 
tures with a lower probability of success, but a high re- 
turn  if successful  (what we  refer to  as “long shot bets”) 
rather  than  just  ‘worse’  ventures  with  a  lower  gross  re- 
turn when successful. We ﬁnd that in sectors impacted by 
the technological shock, VCs increased their investments in 
startups run by younger, less experienced founding teams. 
While  these  characteristics  are  consistent  with  anecdo- 
tal  accounts  of  “long  shot  bets” such  as  Google,  Face- 
book, Airbnb, and Dropbox being founded by young, inex- 
4  it is of course also consistent more 
perienced founders, 
broadly with alternative mechanisms that would point to 
the marginal ﬁrm just being a worse investment. To help 
distinguish  between  these,  we  exploit  the  insight  that 
“long  shot  bets” will  see  a  greater  increase  in  valuation 
in the event that they receive another round of funding. 
This  is  because  long  shot  bets  have  a  small  chance  of  a 
huge payoff, so the relatively infrequent states of the world 
where  the  initial  experiment  generates  positive  informa- 
tion  will  lead  investors  to  update  their  posterior  beliefs 
about the startup’s expected value much more – and hence 
lead to higher step-ups in value from the ﬁrst to the sec- 
ond round of funding. Our empirical results document that 
relative to the pre-period, startups in treated sectors were 
more  likely  to  fail,  but  conditional  on  another  round  of 
funding,  had  nearly  20%  higher  step-ups  in  value  across 
rounds than equivalent startups in untreated sectors. This 
ﬁnding is consistent with the notion that on balance, there 
was  an  increase  in  long  shot  bets  being  ﬁnanced  and  is 
harder to reconcile with other potential channels through 
which  VCs  might  respond  to  the  falling  cost  of  starting 
new ventures. We supplement our empirical results with a 
simple theoretical model that formalizes the intuition out- 
lined above. 

An  interesting  implication  of  our  results  is  that  the 
value-added role of VCs may have fallen at precisely the 
point  in  the  startup’s  lifecycle  that  value-add  is  needed 

3 Note that the term ‘Super Angel’ is somewhat of a misnomer, as these 
investors raise professionally managed funds from limited partners, oper- 
ating effectively as early stage VCs rather than as angel investors. 

4 See Kerr et al. (2014b) for a description of how such ventures were 
not seen as sure bets and how reputable investors chose to pass on the 
chance to invest in them. 

the  most.  Moreover,  younger  and  more-inexperienced 
founders,  who  have  a  technology  that  holds  a  lot  of 
promise  but  are  not  experienced  at  running  a  ﬁrm,  ar- 
guably need mentorship and governance even more than 
those  run  by  more  experienced  entrepreneurs.  Yet  the 
fact  that  VCs  need  to  “spray  and  pray” to  make  the  in- 
vestment  proﬁtable  implies  that  these  startups  only  get 
ﬁnanced  with  limited  governance.  This  ﬁnding  helps  to 
explain  the  rise  of  new  ﬁnancial  intermediaries  such  as 
accelerators  that  provide  scalable ,  lower  cost  forms  of 
mentorship to inexperienced founding teams (and which 
have  only  emerged  in  the  last  decade),  as  these  are  a 
natural response to the gap in governance created by the 
evolution  of  VCs’  investment  behavior  in  early  rounds 
to  a  more  passive  spray  and  pray  approach  ( Hochberg, 
2016 ).  A  second  implication  of  our  result  points  to  a 
disproportionate increase in investments made in sectors 
with more discriminating early experiments, even if there 
is no change in the number of investments in sectors with 
a slower, or more costly, revelation of ﬁnal project value. 
This change nevertheless alters the trajectory of aggregate 
innovation and is consistent with a common refrain in the 
popular press and among some prominent entrepreneurs 
that  VCs  are  not  devoting  suﬃcient  attention  to  backing 
‘fundamental’ innovations in recent years. 

Our work is related to the literature on early stage ﬁ- 
nancing  ( Kerr  et  al.,  2014a;  Hellmann  and  Thiele,  2015; 
Puri  and  Zarutskie,  2012 )  and  the  emergence  in  recent 
years of new ﬁnancial intermediaries that select and shape 
startups  at  the  earliest  stages  in  their  life  ( Cohen  and 
Hochberg, 2014; Bernstein et al., 2017; Gonzalez-Uribe and 
Leatherbee, 2017 ). Our paper provides a framework within 
which to view the emergence of these new ﬁnancial in- 
termediaries.  Our  results  are  also  related  to  a  small  lit- 
erature  on  ﬁnancial  innovations  and  the  important  role 
they  play  translating technological  change  into  economic 
growth  ( Allen  and  Gale,  1994;  Laeven  et  al.,  2015 ).  His- 
torical work on entrepreneurship in the United States has 
documented the central role of the ﬁnancial innovations to 
commercialize new technologies as early as cotton and the 
railroads ( Cain, 2010 ). More recently, Janeway (2012) notes 
how  venture  capital  evolved  to  support  the  funding  of 
biotechnology  ventures.  Our  work  builds  on  this  line  of 
research and documents the important feedback between 
technological change and ﬁnancial intermediaries – tech- 
nological shocks to investment opportunities require adap- 
tation  by investors. Indeed, without  such  adaptation, the 
beneﬁts of new technologies may not be fully realized. Yet, 
this adaption also has consequences for the future trajec- 
tory of innovation by shaping the way in which ﬁnancial 
intermediaries select and manage their investments. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  In 
Section  2 ,  we  describe  how  the  introduction  of  Amazon 
Web  Services  impacted  the  cost  of  starting  ﬁrms  in  cer- 
tain  industries,  and  provide  a  simple  theoretical  frame- 
work to guide the interpretation of our results. For inter- 
ested readers, we note that a more comprehensive model 
on  which  the  framework  is  based  is  available  in  an  In- 
ternet  Appendix .  In  Section  3 ,  we  describe  the  data  we 
use  to  more  systematically  test  these  ideas  and  outline 
our  identiﬁcation  strategy.  Section  4  outlines  our  results

and Section 5 provides robustness tests. Section 6 discusses 
how new intermediaries are responding to the gaps cre- 
ated  by  the  evolution  of  traditional  venture  capital  and 
Section 7 concludes. 

2. Descriptive evidence and theoretical framework 

2.1. Cloud computing 

We  ﬁrst  motivate  our  choice  to  use  the  introduction 
of cloud computing as the technological shock to identify 
adaptation by venture capital investors. A number of prac- 
titioners have pointed to the introduction of cloud com- 
puting as a deﬁning moment when the initial cost of start- 
5 Cloud computing services were

ﬁrst  introduced  by  Amazon  in  early  2006.  Our  research 
suggests that the products included in Amazon’s Web Ser- 
vices (AWS) were “developed ﬁrst and foremost for Ama- 
zon’s internal infrastructure” before opening these services 
up to developers outside Amazon in 2006, the timing of 
which was not anticipated by entrepreneurs or investors 
( Clark, 2012; Vogels, 2011 ). Amazon’s Chief Technology Of- 
ﬁcer (CTO) Werner Vogels recalled that 

“At  Amazon  we  had  developed  unique  software  and 
services  based  on  more  than  a  decade  of  infrastruc- 
ture work for the evolution of the Amazon E-Commerce 
Platform.  This  was  dedicated  software  and  operation 
procedures that drove excellent performance, reliability, 
operational quality and security all at very large scale... 
The thinking then developed that offering Amazon’s ex- 
pertise  in  ultra-scalable  system  software  as  primitive 
infrastructure building blocks delivered through a ser- 
vices interface could trigger whole new world of inno- 
vation as developers no longer needed to focus on buy- 
ing, building and maintaining infrastructure. AWS deliv- 
ered the ﬁrst storage service (Amazon S3) in the spring 
of 2006 and compute (Amazon EC2) in the fall of that 
year” ( Vogels, 2011 ). 

The ability to freely rent hardware in small increments 
that  could  scale  with  demand  was  not  possible  before 
2006.  Firms  had  to  make  large  upfront  investments  in 
hardware to prepare for the small chance that they would 
be a success. The following quote by Mark Andreessen, a 
prominent venture capital investor and serial entrepreneur 
describes this process and the change: 

“In the ‘90s, if you wanted to build an Internet com- 
pany,  you  needed  to  buy  Sun  servers,  Cisco  network- 
ing gear, Oracle databases, and EMC storage systems... 
and those companies would charge you a ton of money 
even just to get up and running. The new startups to- 
day, they don’t buy any of that stuff... They’re paying 

5 As described by Hardy (2014) , “Cloud computing refers to an eﬃcient 
method of managing lots of computer servers, data storage and network- 
ing. [This technological leap led to] immediate performance gains, since 
stand-alone servers typically used only a fraction of their capacity in case 
there was a surge in demand. By linking the machines together into a 
larger “virtual” system, the surge problem eased and a lot of computation 
was freed.”

somewhere between 100x and 10 0 0x [less] per unit of 
compute, per unit of storage, per unit of networking.”

Andreessen also notes that the rise of services such as 
Amazons Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) transformed many 
infrastructure  costs  from  upfront  capital  expenditures  to 
subscription services that could scale with a company as 
it grew, thereby reducing the ﬁxed costs associated with 
6 
starting new ﬁrms. 

Of  course,  ‘renting’  hardware  is  more  expensive  on  a 
unit cost basis than buying the hardware outright. How- 
ever, the ability to rent hardware allowed entrepreneurs to 
initially raise smaller amounts of capital to test technologi- 
cal viability and customer demand, only making large cap- 
ital  expenditures  in  hardware  once  their  startup  showed 
initial success and had achieved some scale. Thus, the pri- 
mary  effect  of  cloud  computing  was  not  to  lower  total 
costs, but rather to lower the cost of initial experiments 
when the probability of failure was high. A prominent ex- 
ample is that of Dropbox, which was founded in 2007, yet 
stored all of its ﬁles on Amazon’s Cloud Computing servers 
until 2015, rather than on hardware that it owned and op- 
erated itself. Once it reached scale, however, management 
migrated  to  its  own  servers  to  improve  unit  economics. 
As Dropbox’s vice president noted in an interview about 
why it stopped renting from Amazon, “Nobody is running 
a cloud business as a charity. There is some margin some- 
where.” ( Metz, 2016 ). 

2.2. A simple model of multi-stage ﬁnancing 

We  turn  next  to  providing  a  simple  model  of  multi- 
stage ﬁnancing in order to illustrate how a fall in the cost 
of  starting  ventures  might  impact  the  investments  made

7 While this simple model provides a theoretical framework within 
which to view our results, a more ﬂeshed out equilibrium model of multi- 
stage ﬁnancing in the Internet Appendix outlines how a shift in the cost 
of experimentation can not only impact marginal ventures but also have 
an impact on infra-marginal investments, thereby having a much larger 
impact on the way in which venture capital investors manage their port- 
folios. 

8 This might be the building of a prototype, initial traction with cus- 
tomers, or the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) regulated Phase I trials 
on the path of a new drug, etc. 

9 One particular functional form that is sometimes used with this set 
up is to assume that the ﬁrst and second stage have the same underlying 
probability of success, p . In this case p 1 can be thought of as the uncon- 
ditional expectation of p , and E [ p 2 | S ] and E [ p 2 | F ] just follow Bayes’ rule.

investor. Failure in the second stage yields a payoff of zero. 
The  probability  of  ‘success’  (positive  information)  in  the 
ﬁrst stage is p 1 
. 

The startup requires $ X of capital in the ﬁrst round and 
$ Y in the second round of ﬁnancing. The entrepreneur is 
assumed to have no capital while the investor has enough 
to  fund  the  project  for  both  periods.  An  investor  who 
chooses not to invest at either stage can instead earn a safe 
return of r per period (investor outside option) which we 
normalize to zero for simplicity. The extensive form of the 
game played by the investor is shown in Fig. 1 .

In order to focus on the interesting cases, we assume 
that if the project ‘fails’ in the ﬁrst period (i.e. interme- 
diate information is negative), then it is NPV negative in 
∗
the second period, i.e., p F 
 Y . Further, if the project ‘suc- 
ceeds’ in the ﬁrst period (i.e., intermediate information is 
positive),  then  it  is  Net  Present  Value  (NPV)  positive  in 
∗
the  second  period,  i.e.,  p S 
 Y .  Without  these  assump- 
tions the ﬁrst stage ‘experiment’ is not relevant as, for ex- 
∗
ample, p F 
 Y would imply that the investor will make 
the second-round investment no matter what the result of 
the ﬁrst stage investment is. We therefore assume that VCs 
will always abandon the investment if intermediate infor- 
mation is negative and always invest Y if intermediate in- 
formation is positive. We further assume that VCs compete 
away rents, so that the NPV of their investment in each 
stage is always zero.

It is intuitive that a fall in the cost of starting ventures, 
X , would lead to a larger number of investments from a 
VC’s portfolio and – given partner time is a scarce resource 
– that this should lead to a fall in governance at the initial 
round of funding. However, note that the composition of 
ventures that get funded will also change. To see why, note 

that the denominator of Eq. (1) is the expected value of the 
startup at the second stage conditional on success in the 
ﬁrst stage experiment, also referred to as the “pre-money 
valuation” of the venture at the second round of ﬁnanc- 
ing. Thus, the marginal venture which just becomes NPV 
positive when X falls is either one with a lower expected 
value conditional on initial success – we refer to these as 
“worse” startup ventures – or one with a lower p 1 
. Note 
that startups with a lower p 1 
are ventures with greater op- 
tion value, or “long shot bets,” since they are more likely 
to fail, but conditional on positive intermediate informa- 
tion are equally likely to have a big success. 

∗ V 

Of  course,  these  are  not  mutually  exclusive  outcomes 
in  that  both  “worse” ventures  and  “long  shot  bets” be- 
come viable investments when X falls. However, the model 
generates discriminating predictions that can help distin- 
guish whether, empirically, on average, the increase in in- 
vestments when X fell was driven by one type of venture 
or another. In particular, if the dominant driver is an in- 
crease in “long shot bets”, we should see this manifested in 
three ways. First, we should ﬁnd ex ante evidence of long 
shot bets, which we aim to capture empirically through the 
age and experience of founding teams when they are ﬁrst 
funded. Secondly, if the increase in investments is domi- 
nated by ventures with a lower p 1 
(as opposed to a lower 
− Y ), we should see an increase in failure rates fol- 
p S 
lowing  the  initial  round  of  funding  (as  opposed  to  ini- 
tial failure rates remaining roughly constant). Finally, con- 
ditional on not failing after the ﬁrst round, ﬁrms with a 
lower p 1 
should see a higher step-up in value if they do 
get another round of funding and should have the same, or 
higher exit values when they eventually reach a liquidity 
event. The intuition behind a lower p 1 
leading to a higher 
step-up is that if investors put a lower probability on the 
startup demonstrating intermediate success, seeing success 
after the ﬁrst round of funding leads them to update their 
priors more, thereby leading to a higher change in valua- 
tion from the ﬁrst round to the next. This intuition can be 
seen formally in the model by noting that the step-up in 
value – calculated as the pre-money valuation in round 2

divided by the post-money valuation in round 1 – is in- 
10 Hence if the VCs’ new invest-

. 
ments are comprised mostly of long shot bets, we should 
see higher step-ups in value for treated ﬁrms in the post- 
period. On the other hand, if the dominant driver of the 
increased funding is worse investments, then p 1 
will not 
change much and hence we should see little change in the 
step-ups of ventures being funded in the post-period. 

3. Data and estimation strategy 

We turn next to a systematic analysis of VC ﬁnancings. 
Our  analysis  is  based  on  the  VentureSource  database  of 
venture  capital  ﬁnancings,  investors,  and  entrepreneurial

Founders  were  identiﬁed  with  data  from  VentureSource 
and additional data collection detailed in Ewens and Fons- 
Rosen (2015) . 

We  begin  by  including  every  ﬁrst  round  of  funding 
among  VC-backed  startups  that  occurred  between  2002 
and 2010 and was labeled as an early stage round of ﬁ-

Descriptive statistics. This table reports descriptive statistics on 
US-based startups that received Seed or Series A ﬁnancing from an 
investor in the VentureSource database between 2002 and 2010. 
The characteristics of ﬁrms and entrepreneurs are reported as of 
the date of ﬁrst funding. “First capital (m)” is the ﬁrst capital 
raised in the ﬁrm’s ﬁrst VC ﬁnancing. “Firm age (yrs.)” is the age 
of the startup at the time of ﬁrst ﬁnancing. “Team age (yrs.)” is 
the average age of the founding team at the time of ﬁrst ﬁnanc- 
ing. “Serial founders” is the fraction of ﬁrms that have at least one 
repeat founder on the founding team. “% Failed” is the fraction of 
ﬁrms that went out of business by the end of 2015. “% Follow-on”
is the fraction of ﬁrms that had a follow on investment by the end 
of 2015. “Step-up in value” reports the ratio of pre-money in the 
subsequent round to the post-money of the current round (if both 
are available). “Exit value to capital” is the reported exit valuation 
divided by the total capital raised by the entrepreneurial ﬁrm. “% 
First board” is the fraction of ﬁrms that had at least one investor 
who took a board seat in the ﬁrst ﬁnancing round. The “# Firms”
reports the total number of ﬁrms for which we can calculate the 
variable.

10 To put this in terms of a numerical example, suppose there is a 20% 
chance of success in round 1 and a 40% chance of success in round 2. 
Initially, it takes $4 million to reach round 2 and it takes a further $10 
million in round 2 to reach an exit of $100 million. Assume that if the 
ﬁrm fails in either round 1 or round 2 it is worth zero. Working back- 
∗
wards, the post-money valuation in round 2 will be $40 million (40% 
$100 million) and the pre-money valuation in round 2 will be $30 mil- 
lion. Since the probability of success in round 1 is 20%, the post-money 
valuation in round 1 is $6 million and the pre-money valuation in round 
1 is $2 million and the VC would take 66.7% of the company in the ﬁrst 
round of funding. Note also that the lowest probability of ﬁrst-round suc- 
cess that a VC would be willing to fund in round 1 would therefore be 
/
 5, which is 
4 
inversely proportional to the probability of success from getting from one 
round to the next (1/20%). Suppose now that the ﬁrst round of ﬁnancing 
can be done with $2 million instead of the original $4 million. The mini- 
=
 6.67%. That 
mum possible probability of ﬁrst round success falls to 2/30 
is, startups with a probability of initial success between 6.67% and 13.33% 
now become viable investments. But note that for a ﬁrm whose probabil- 
ity of initial success is 10% (not viable before but now viable), the step up 
from round 1 to round 2 (if the ﬁrm shows intermediate success) will be

11 The coverage of ﬁnancing rounds is extremely comprehensive in Ven- 
tureSource and particularly so during our period of analysis, because 
scanned pdf versions of Form D ﬁlings were available on the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) website for much of our sample period, 
making it much easier for data providers to collect comprehensive infor- 
mation.

ing a data-driven quantitative model.

employment, person age, education background, and gender. Lexis Nexus

presents descriptive statistics for the key variables used in 
the analysis. 

3.1. Assigning treated and control using industry variation 

Importantly for our analysis, the advent of cloud com- 
puting  in  2006  did  not  impact  all  industries  equally.  Its 
effects were conﬁned to businesses with a strong online 
presence such as software-as-a-service, social networks, or 
retail e-commerce websites. 

Paul Graham, the founder of prominent accelerator, Y- 

Combinator, noted in 2008 that 

“[the  reason]  no  one  was  doing  quite  what  we  do  is 
that till recently it was a lot more expensive to start 
a startup. You’ll notice we haven’t funded any biotech 
startups. That’s still expensive.”15 

pacted by the introduction of AWS and hence are endogenous. Neverthe- 
less, we note that the results presented below are robust to dropping the 
small number of ﬁnancings greater than $25m or considering only seed 
rounds of ﬁnancing. 

15 Source: http://paulgraham.com/ycombinator.html . Note also that in 
the past few years technological advances in other sectors – for exam- 
ple, CRISPR/Cas genome editing techniques for biotechnology startups –
have made it cheaper to start companies in biotechnology as well. This is 
why we limit our sample to a few years before and after 2006 to ensure 
a robust identiﬁcation strategy. 

428 

M. Ewens et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 128 (2018) 422–442 

We exploit this cross-sectional heterogeneity in the im- 
pact of cloud computing across industry sectors to identify 
the effect on venture capital investors. Speciﬁcally, we use 
narrow industry classiﬁcations assigned to entrepreneurial 
ﬁrms in the VentureSource database. VentureSource tracks 
venture  capital  activity  in  the  United  States  and  assigns 
industries to  entrepreneurial ﬁrms  by looking at  the an- 
swer to the question “What is the essential product or ser- 
vice that the company provides?” We use the 26 distinct 
industry-segments in VentureSource to create our deﬁni- 
tions  of  “treated” and  “control.” Such  segments  include 
“Consumer  Information  Services,” “Renewable  and  Non- 
Renewable Energy,” and “Biopharmaceuticals’.’ The goal is 
to  assign  each  one  of  the  26  categories  to  “treated” or 
“control” based on whether the typical ﬁrm in that indus- 
try classiﬁcation beneﬁted from the introduction of AWS. 
Firms that would beneﬁt include those that provided on- 
line services, high-traﬃc websites, ﬁle storage or services, 
web hosting, or online retail. 

To facilitate assignment of industry to treated and con- 
trol, we begin with an analysis of the companies in each 
industry-segment.  Table  A.1  in  the  Appendix  provides  a 
summary of the top ten words in the one paragraph com- 
pany  descriptions  available  in  VentureSource  across  all 
ﬁrms in each industry-segment from 2002 – 2010. Panel 
A  presents  the  list  of  keywords  associated  with  the  ﬁ- 
nal eight treated industries from our classiﬁcation. Popular 
words  include  “software,” “web,” “online,” and  “service.”
The introduction of the Amazon cloud effectively allowed 
ﬁrms such as these to outsource their backend online ser- 
vices in ways that were not possible prior to 2006. In Panel 
B, the 19 control industry segments exhibit words that ref- 
erence tangible goods such as “drug,” “devices,” and “sys- 
tem.” The control classiﬁcation includes ﬁrms who produce 
semiconductors or develop cancer drugs and thus have lit- 
tle to gain after the new cloud technology became avail- 
able. 

To  formalize  this  intuition  of  ﬁrms  that  are  most 
likely  to  beneﬁt  from  AWS,  we  measure  the  fraction  of 
ﬁrms whose description has at least one of the keywords 
“Online,” “E-commerce,” “Hosting,” or  “Web” in  each 
industry  segment,  to  provide  an  industry-segment-level 
exposure to the treatment. We deliberately choose not to 
deﬁne treatment at the ﬁrm-level as this is endogenous. 
Rather, we deﬁne treatment based on likelihood of beneﬁt 
based  on  the  description  of  activity  among  pre-period 
ﬁrms  and  show  a  strong  correlation  between  this  and 
activity among ﬁrms in the same industry-segment in the 
post-period. Table 2 provides the number of ﬁrms in each 
industry-segment and the share of ﬁrms with at least one 
of  the  keywords  above.  As  can  be  seen  from  Column  4, 
the industry-segments categorized as “Treated” have a sig- 
niﬁcantly higher share of the keywords compared to those 
in “Non-treated” industries, where the prevalence is close 
to zero. In addition, it can be seen by comparing Columns 
2  and  4  that  the  incidence  of  these  words  increased  in 
most  of  the  Treated  segments  in  the  post  period,  while 
they  remained  equally  non-existent  in  the  Non-treated 
segments. Finally, by comparing Columns 1 and 3, it can 
be seen that there is a disproportionate growth in number 
of  ﬁrms  entering  treated  segments  in  the  post-period 

compared to those in Non-treated segments. This provides 
us with conﬁdence that the words we are picking up are 
indeed good markers of industry-segments that beneﬁted 
from the introduction of AWS. 

With this cross-sectional separation of entrepreneurial 
ﬁrms  by  exposure  to  the  introduction  of  the  Amazon 
cloud  technology,  the  eight  industry-segments  classiﬁed 
as  treated  are  “Business  Support  Services,” “Consumer 
Information Services,” “Financial Institutions and Services,”
“Media  and  Content,” “Medical  Software  and  Informa- 
tion  Services,” “Retailers,” “Software,” and  “Travel  and 
Leisure.” Importantly,  nearly  all  of  these  industry  clas- 
siﬁcations  signal  a  service  rather  than  production  of 
good,  and  are  likely  to  beneﬁt  from  cloud  computing 
due  to  their  delivery  of  the  service  over  the  web.  The 
remaining  19  industry  segments  classiﬁed  as  controls 
include  “Aerospace  and  Defense,” “Biopharmaceuticals,”
“Communications and Networking,” “Electronics and Com- 
puter  Hardware,” “Healthcare  Services,” “Machinery  and 
Industrial  Goods,” “Materials  and  Chemicals,” “Medical 
Devices and Equipment,” “Renewable and Non-Renewable 
Energy,” and “Semiconductors.”16 Importantly, the category 
“Communications  and  Networking” includes  ﬁrms  that 
produce  hardware  or  sell  services  such  “leased-line  and 
dial  up  services,” “optical  connectivity  solutions,” and 
“high-performance  tunable  lasers.” Similarly,  Healthcare 
Services were less likely to be delivered over the web due 
to privacy concerns over this period. 

3.2. Estimation strategy 

Our  estimation  strategy  is  a  standard  differences-in- 
differences regression. Given the timing of the technologi- 
cal shock, our analysis compares VCs’ investments between 
2006–2010 with the investments from 2002 to 2005. Also, 
since the technological shock disproportionately impacted 
early stage investments, our analysis focuses on the ﬁrst, 
early  stage  round  of  funding  among  VC-backed  startups, 
although  as  we  show  in  the  robustness  section,  we  run 
placebo  tests  on  later  rounds  of  ﬁnancing  to  highlight 
that indeed the shifts are driven by changes in the initial 
rounds of ﬁnancing rather than changes across the board. 
Estimations are run at the VC ﬁrm-startup-year level and 
take the form:

Table 2 
Treated vs. non-treated industry segments. This table documents the categorization of industry- 
segments to “Treated” or “Non-Treated” for the sample of ﬁrms described in Table 1 . It uses the 
description of each ﬁrm to characterize the degree to which the introduction of AWS was likely to 
be beneﬁcial to the ﬁrm in its early stages. In particular, it measures the fraction of ﬁrms whose 
description has at least one of the keywords “Online,” “E-commerce,” “Hosting,” or “Web” in each 
industry-segment, to provide an industry-segment-level exposure to the treatment. We deliberately 
choose not to deﬁne treatment at the ﬁrm-level as this is endogenous. Rather, we deﬁne treatment 
based on likelihood of beneﬁt based on the description of activity among pre-period ﬁrms, show a 
strong correlation between this and activity among ﬁrms in the same industry-segment in the post- 
period. The column “# Firms” presents the count of ﬁrms with the industry classiﬁcation, while the 
column “Word share” provides the ratio described above. “2002–2010” refers to ﬁrms in the full 
sample period, while “20 02–20 05” refers to the measure based on pre-period ﬁrms only. We lose 47 
ﬁrms because they lack a business description or industry classiﬁcation.

Note  that  since  the  deﬁnition  of  treated  and  control 
ﬁrms is based on industry-segments, which is more gran- 
ular  than  broad  industry  group  classiﬁcations,  the  inclu- 
sion of industry group ﬁxed effects (such Biopharmaceu- 
ticals and Healthcare, Information Technology, etc.) in all 
our  estimations  effectively  provides  within-industry  im- 
pacts of the treatment. This is particularly useful as ven- 
ture capital ﬁrms often have a broad industry or sector fo- 
cus for their investments. Note also that since (2) includes 
year  ﬁxed  effects,  the  main  effect  of  Post  is  not  identi- 
ﬁed. 

As with any differences-in-differences estimation strat- 
egy,  our  key  identifying  assumption  is  one  of  parallel 
trends  – that  is,  that  the  “untreated” industry-segments 
provide an appropriate counterfactual for what would have 
happened to the treated ﬁrms had they not beneﬁted from 
the  introduction  of  cloud  computing.  While  the  parallel 

trends assumption, by deﬁnition, cannot be proven, we aim 
to  validate  it  in  several  ways.  First,  Columns  1  and  3  of 
Table 2 document that the rate of investment in the Non- 
treated sectors was quite comparable across the pre- and 
post-periods.  Post-period  investment  in  the  Non-treated 
sector rose by about 30% compared to the pre-period, ris- 
ing from 350 ﬁrms per year in non-treated sectors receiv- 
ing ﬁrst ﬁnancing from VCs to about 450 ﬁrms per year in 
the post-period. On the other hand, investment into ﬁrms 
in treated sectors rose from about 375 ﬁrms per year to 
over 700 ﬁrms per year, showing that the changes we ob- 
serve  are  driven  by  ﬁrms  in  the  treated  sectors,  as  op- 
posed to, for example, a smaller fall in investments in the 
control group. In addition, we show in dynamic speciﬁca- 
tions that there is no evidence of pre-trends (and ﬁnd in 
unreported ﬁgures that there was no differential trend by 
industry across any of the outcome variables in the pre-

period),  providing  further  support  for  the  parallel  trends 
assumption. 

of our ﬁndings as they cannot account for the full set of 
patterns we see. 

Our  identiﬁcation  is  also  predicated  on  a  second  key 
assumption that no other systematic change in 2006 im- 
pacted precisely the set of ﬁrms we classify as treated, in 
a manner consistent with our ﬁndings but through some 
other channel. We address three such potential channels in 
detail in the robustness tests, documented in Section 5 of 
the paper, but brieﬂy outline them here as well. First, we 
document that our results are not driven by any changes 
due  to  the  ﬁnancial  crisis,  which  manifested  itself  rela- 
tively brieﬂy in the venture capital industry towards the 
end of our sample and was mostly conﬁned to 2009. 

Second,  we  examine  other  potential  technological 
changes  to  the  VC  opportunity  set,  for  example,  the  in- 
troduction of the iPhone and its related apps. Consistent 
with the view that very few of these apps were funded by 
VC investors, we ﬁnd that excluding ﬁrms in any way re- 
lated to the iPhone appstore does not impact our results 
at all. Finally, we address other potential channels – such 
as  younger  entrepreneurs  needing  more  governance  and 
hence needing more staging, or entry by new intermedi- 
aries  driving  up  prices,  leading to  smaller  investments –
that are consistent with some of our results. We provide 
extensive evidence that these are unlikely to be the drivers 

4. Results 

4.1. Capital raised in ﬁrst ﬁnancing 

We ﬁrst document that the cost of starting businesses 
did fall following the introduction of Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) in 2006, as suggested by practitioners. Table 3 re- 
ports the estimation results from (2) where the dependent 
variable  is  log  size  of  the  investment  in  the  ﬁrst  round 
of funding for VC-backed ﬁrms in the period 2002–2010. 
Columns  1–3  include  VC  ﬁrms  that  were  active  at  any 
point in the sample period. Columns 4–6 are run on the 
subset of VCs that had at least three investments in the 
pre-2006 time period (i.e., were active in the pre-period). 
For each set of ﬁrms, the ﬁrst column includes only indus- 
try ﬁxed effects, the second column adds year ﬁxed effects 
and the third column further adds VC-ﬁrm ﬁxed effects. As 
can be seen from Table 3 , there is a signiﬁcant decrease in 
the capital invested by VCs in ﬁrst ﬁnancings for startups 
in treated industry segments. Relative to the non-treated 
industry ﬁrms, capital invested in treated startups is be- 
tween 15% to 27% lower. This difference represents a $670

Table 4 
Initial funding size: quantile estimates. This table reports results from quantile regressions where the depen- 
dent variable is the log of initial investment for the startup in which a given VC invested. A unit of observation 
is an entrepreneurial ﬁrm ﬁnancing associated with an investor. VCs who are active in the pre-period are de- 
ﬁned as those investors with at least three investments prior to 2006. Industry ﬁxed effects control for the ﬁve 
industry groups: Biotechnology and health-care, Business and ﬁnancial services, Consumer goods and services, 
Energy and industrials, and Information technology. “Treated” industries are deﬁned at a more granular-level 
than these industry classiﬁcations so there is within-industry variation in startups that are deﬁned as “treated”
vs. not. “Year FE” indicate dummies for ﬁnancing year, “Industry FE” are dummies for the ﬁve major indus- 
tries, and “VC ﬁrm FE” are VC ﬁrm ﬁxed effects. Bootstrapped standard errors (500 repetitions) are reported in

thousand to $1.3 million fall in the average capital invested 
17  We can 
in the ﬁrst round of funding in the pre-period. 
also see that the smaller investment amount was a func- 
tion  of  both  entry  by  new  investors  who  wrote  smaller 
checks as well as a change in behavior from incumbents. 
We will continue to see this in all of the regressions below. 
Thus the effects we ﬁnd seem to stem both from entry as 
well as adaptation. 

Table 4 reports the results from quantile regressions es- 
timated at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, again for 
any VCs in the sample and for the subset that were most 
active.  It  documents  that  the  initial  funding  size  fell  in 
these  industry-segments  across  all  points  in  the  funding 
size distribution, not just on average as seen in Table 3 . 
Fig. 2 reports the results from a dynamic speciﬁcation of 
Eq. (2) where each point is an estimate of the interaction 
of  year  and treated  dummies,  relative to  year  2006.  The 
bands correspond to 95% conﬁdence intervals. The patterns 
in the ﬁgure demonstrate there is no pre-trend and that 
the timing of the falling cost of ﬁrst ﬁnancings is consis- 
tent with the introduction of AWS. 

17 Note that these magnitudes may seem small relative to what industry 
practitioners describe as the importance of the shock. This is likely in part 
due to the fact that we are assigning ‘treated’ status to industries rather 
than to ﬁrms to address concerns about endogeneity. Since not every ﬁrm 
in a treated industry is treated, this measurement error will tend to bias 
estimates towards zero. 

4.2. VC response: “Spray and pray” investing 

4.2.1. Changes in the number of investments 

Having  shown  the  falling  cost  of  starting  businesses 
in“treated” industry-segments,  we  turn  next  to  under- 
standing its consequences for the investment strategies of 
VCs and the composition of their portfolios. First, we pro- 
vide descriptive evidence of this by calculating the number 
of newly ﬁnanced ﬁrms in treated and non-treated indus- 
tries from 2002 to 2010. The ratio of these treated to non- 
treated numbers is reported in Fig. 3 , where a ratio of one 
implies that there were an equal amount of ﬁrms ﬁnanced 
in the two categories. There is a marked increase in invest- 
ments that persists in the post-period suggesting a shift in 
the ﬁnancing rates of treated industry startups. 

We next test for this change in a regression context by 
studying the total number of ﬁrst-time investments in en- 
trepreneurial ﬁrms made by VCs in each year and indus- 
try. The count is scaled by the total investors in the round 
so large syndicated investments do not receive additional 
weight. A unit of observation is thus a VC ﬁrm, year, and 
one of two industry groups – “treated” and “non-treated.”
For years with no investment activity by a given investor, 
the count is zero so that we have a balanced panel across 
investor-year-industry cells. The dependent variable of in- 
terest is the log of one plus this count. Table 5 reports the 
results for the sample of all VCs and those with pre-2006 
investment activity.

Fig. 2.  Difference-in-difference estimates for ﬁrst capital raised: treated and non-treated. The ﬁgure plots the coeﬃcients for the interaction terms of each 
ﬁnancing year and the treated industry dummy for an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression where the dependent variable, K it , is the log of the ﬁrst VC 
capital raised and the unit of observation is an entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s ﬁrst ﬁnancing event. The sample includes US-based startups that received Seed or 
Series A ﬁnancing from an investor in the Venture Source database between 2002 and 2010. The 2006 interaction term is the excluded category, reported 
as zero in the ﬁgure. The vertical lines represent the 95% conﬁdence interval for the coeﬃcient estimates with robust standard errors. 

Fig. 3.  New VC-backed ﬁrms in treated industries. This ﬁgure reports the ratio of treated companies to untreated companies receiving a ﬁrst, early stage 
ﬁnancing as reported by VentureSource. The sample includes US-based startups that received Seed or Series A ﬁnancing from an investor in the Venture 
Source database between 2002 and 2010. A treated company is in one of the following industries (from VentureSource): “Business Support Services,”
“Consumer Information Services,” “Financial Institutions and Services,” “Media and Content,” “Medical Software and Information Services,” “Retailers,”
“Software,” and “Travel and Leisure.” A ratio of one implies that there were an equal amount of new entrepreneurial ﬁrms ﬁnanced in that year in treated 
and untreated industries. The vertical line represents the approximate date of the introduction of Amazon Web Services, our treatment event.

Table 5 
Total investments by investors. This table reports results from results of OLS and VC 
ﬁrm ﬁxed effects regression of total investments made by investors. Total investments 
are scaled by the number of investors in each ﬁrst-round investment to ensure that 
entrepreneurial ﬁrms with more investors do not receive additional weight. A unit of 
observation is a quarter and industry, where industry is treated or non-treated as de- 
ﬁned in Table 2 . For Columns 1 and 2, all VCs are included in the analysis in OLS and FE 
speciﬁcation, respectively. Columns 3 and 4 have the same speciﬁcations for the sample 
of VCs who have investments in the pre-period (i.e., “Active” VCs). Industry ﬁxed ef- 
fects control for the ﬁve industry groups: Biotechnology and health-care, Business and 
ﬁnancial services, Consumer goods and services, Energy and industrials, and Informa- 
tion technology. “Treated” industries are deﬁned at a more granular-level than these 
industry classiﬁcations so there is within-industry variation in startups that are deﬁned 
as “treated” vs. not. “Year FE” indicate dummies for ﬁnancing year and “VC ﬁrm FE” are 
VC ﬁrm ﬁxed effects. Standard errors clustered by quarter are reported in parentheses.

Column 1 of Table 5 shows an increase in investments 
in treated industries after 2006 across all VCs. Column 2 
show a similar magnitude when comparing changes in in- 
vestment rates within a VC’s portfolio over the sample pe- 
riod. When we condition on the sample of VCs who have 
pre-2006 investments (Columns 3 and 4) the magnitudes 
are  slightly  larger  and  still  positive.  The  economic  inter- 
pretation of the estimate in the ﬁnal column suggests 1.5 
additional investments every two years in a VC fund. As 
the typical VC fund invests in 10–15 investments, this in- 
crease  represents  a  meaningful  change  in  the  composi- 
tion of the portfolio. When combined with the results in 
Fig.  3 ,  these  ﬁndings  suggest  that  the  VC  industry  as  a 
whole substantially increased investments to treated sec- 
tors  after  2005,  although  importantly,  this  increase  did 
not  come  at  the  expense  of  investments  in  non-treated 
sectors. 

18 

4.2.2. Changes in governance 

An increase in the number of investments implies that 
VCs are less likely to actively govern their portfolio compa- 
nies, and instead emphasize a more passive learning role 

18 In unreported analyses, we also examine fund raising by VC investors. 
We assign a fund as being focused on treated sectors if at least 75% of 
its investments in the ﬁrst year are made in treated segments. Similarly, 
we deﬁne a fund as focused on non-treated sectors if less than 25% of its 
investments in the ﬁrst year are made in treated segments. The remaining 
funds are those that are not specialized in either treated or non-treated 
segments. Studying both the number of funds raised and the total capital 
raised by funds over the sample period, we ﬁnd no evidence of crowding 
out of non-treated segments. 

in the earliest stages of their investments. To measure gov- 
ernance, we identify whether any investor in the ﬁrst ﬁ- 
nancing took a board seat. Unfortunately, we cannot always 
date the timing of the board’s creation and an individual 
investor’s start date on the board. The sample of ﬁnanc- 
ings is thus smaller than that of the main analysis. If none 
of the investors in the ﬁrst ﬁnancing are ever listed as a 
board member, then we label the ﬁnancing as having no 
board seat. If at least one investor can be identiﬁed as a 
ﬁrst ﬁnancing board member, then the ﬁnancing is labeled 
as such. Table 6 presents the results from linear probabil- 
ity models where the dependent variable takes the value 
of one if the VC is listed as a board member. 

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 present the main results 
where we ﬁrst include all investors active in 2002–2010. 
The  coeﬃcient  on  “Treated  X  Post-2005” shows  a  lower 
probability  that  a  ﬁrst  ﬁnancing  has  an  investor  with  a 
board  seat.  The  economic  magnitude  of  these  estimates 
suggests a 14% lower probability of an investor joining the 
board.  The  remaining  columns  of  the  table  include  only 
those  ﬁnancings  with  active  investors  with  and  without 
VC  ﬁrm  ﬁxed  effects.  Column  3  shows  that  on  average, 
the use of boards fell. Here, the economic magnitude is a 
21% lower probability an investor takes a board seat in the 
ﬁrst ﬁnancing. The last column indicates that this change 
is  also  present  within-VC,  including  for  the  more  active 
investors. Overall, the results indicate that the changes in 
governance styles are not just driven by a changing com- 
position of investors with different governance styles, but 
also due to adaptation by existing investors to focus less 
on governance in the early stages of a ﬁrm’s life.

4.3. Characteristics of portfolio companies 

4.3.1. Characteristics of founding teams 

We  next  examine  empirically  how  the  characteristics 
of VC-backed entrepreneurial ﬁrms changed after startup 
costs fell. 

Table  7  presents  the  exante  characteristics  of  invest- 
ments  made  by  VCs  to  see  if  they  shift  in  the  post- 
2005 period. In particular, we consider two attributes of 
the  portfolio  companies  – average  age  of  the  founders 
(to  proxy  more  broadly  for  founder  experience)  and  the 
speciﬁc entrepreneurial experience of the founding team. 
Columns  1  and  2  of  Table  7  examine  whether  the  av- 
erage  age  of  the  founding  team  in  newly  ﬁnanced  en- 
trepreneurial ﬁrms changes after the introduction of AWS. 
A  decrease  in  the  average  age  of  entrepreneurial  ﬁrm 
founders would suggest that investors are investing in less 
experienced, riskier founding teams. The coeﬃcient on the 
interaction term in both samples “Treated X Post” indicates 
a statistically signiﬁcant drop in the relative age of found- 
ing teams in VC ﬁrm portfolios. 

Next, Columns 3 and 4 of Table 7 study the relationship 
between the post-period treated investments and the en- 
trepreneurial experience of founding teams. Here, the de- 
pendent variable is an indicator that takes the value of one 
if  at  least  one  of  the  founding  team  members  has  prior 
founding experience (i.e., serial entrepreneur). The coeﬃ- 
cient estimates on the interaction terms are again negative 

and  statistically  signiﬁcant,  suggesting  that  VC  investors 
in  treated  segments  are  more  willing  to  back  founders 
with less startup experience. While younger and less ex- 
perienced founding teams could be consistent with either 
‘worse’ teams or teams that are ‘long shot bets,’ we note 
that  one  might  have  thought  that  investing  in  younger 
founders  with  less  entrepreneurial  experience  would  re- 
quire increased governance. This makes the falling gover- 
nance as evidenced by the fall in board activity early in the 
life of startups even more remarkable, and is a fact that we 
return to in the following section. 

4.3.2. Outcomes of investments 

Having  shown  that  the  exante  characteristics  of  en- 
trepreneurial ﬁrms backed by VC changed after 2005, we 
next  investigate  whether  these  differences  translate  into 
outcomes  and  success  rates.  Recall  that  the  theoretical 
framework highlighted how an increase in ‘long shot bets’ 
should  be  associated  with  an  increase  in  failure  rates 
following the ﬁrst round of funding, but with higher step- 
ups  in  value  for  ﬁrms  that  did  in  fact  receive  follow-on 
ﬁnancing.  Table  8  shows  ﬁrst  that  initial  investments  in 
startups  in  “treated” industries  in  the  post-period  were 
less likely to receive a follow-on investment (i.e., reinvest- 
ment  by  VCs),  and  were  more  likely  to  fail.  The  results 
in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 8 show the fall in follow-on 
rates in the treated group and also suggest that this effect 
was  stronger  for  those  that  receive  capital  from  active,

Table 7 
Ex ante characteristics of portfolio companies. This table reports results from results of VC 
ﬁrm ﬁxed effects regression for founder characteristics at the time of ﬁrst ﬁnancing. A unit 
of observation is an entrepreneurial ﬁrm ﬁnancing associated with an investor. The de- 
pendent variable in Columns 1 and 2 is the log of the average entrepreneurial team age 
at the time of ﬁnancing. The dependent variable in Columns 3 and 4 is an indicator that 
equals one if at least one of the founders is a serial entrepreneur at the time of the ﬁnanc- 
ing event. VCs who are active in the pre-period (Columns 2 and 4) are deﬁned as those 
investors with at least three investments in the pre-period. Industry ﬁxed effects control 
for the ﬁve industry groups: Biotechnology and health-care, Business and ﬁnancial services, 
Consumer goods and services, Energy and industrials, and Information technology. “Treated”
industries are deﬁned at a more granular-level than these industry classiﬁcations so there 
is within-industry variation in startups that are deﬁned as “treated” vs. not. “Year FE” indi- 
cate dummies for ﬁnancing year and “VC ﬁrm FE” are VC ﬁrm ﬁxed effects. Standard errors

incumbent investors. This result is particularly interesting 
in  light  of  evidence  that  suggests  that  experienced  VCs 
are  potentially  more  likely  to  be  failure  tolerant  ( Tian 
and  Wang,  2014 ).  Consistent  with  anecdotal  accounts, 
this suggests that even experienced VCs may be adapting 
their investment style towards more “spray and pray” in 
the early stages, particularly in industries where the cost 
of starting ﬁrms has fallen substantially and hence made 
abandonment options more valuable. The last two columns 
of Table 8 also show an increased likelihood of ultimate 
failure,  again  particularly  driven  by  active  incumbents 
19 
changing  their  investment  strategies  in  treated  sectors. 
The  lower  likelihood  of  receiving  follow-on  funding  is 
consistent with the notion that the marginal investments 
were longshot bets, rather than just being worse ﬁrms. 

We next also consider two measures of success to as- 
certain if those ﬁrms that did not fail differ in their out- 
comes.  The  ﬁrst  measure  is  the  step-up  in  value  across 

19 The large rise in initial number of ﬁnancing events, combined with a 
smaller follow-on rate has been colloquially referred to as the “Series A 
crunch.” However, investors seem to share the perspective that compa- 
nies deserving of the next round of funding were receiving capital ( http: 
//www.geekwire.com/2014/deserving- companies- will- weather- series- 
crunch- vcs- say/ ). 

rounds, which captures the change in valuation from the 
post-money valuation in the initial round of ﬁnancing to 
the pre-money valuation of the subsequent round of eq- 
uity ﬁnancing. 

The second measure is the ratio of exit value to total 
capital  invested  (or  “total  economic  return”)  for  startups 
that ultimately had a successful exit. Columns 1 and 2 of 
Table 9 show that the increase in equity valuation – “step- 
up” – is 15%–20% larger for the treated industry ﬁrms af- 
ter 2005. The last two columns of Table 9 show that this 
increased valuation change manifests itself in higher exit 
valuations to capital raised. Thus, both interim valuations 
increase  and  the  economic  returns  are  larger.  Combined 
with the higher failure rates found in Table 8 , the evidence 
is  in  favor  of  a  shift  to  higher  option  value  rather  than 
just  lower  quality  investments  after  the  treatment  event 
of AWS. We further validate this hypothesis by looking at 
whether the step-ups in value and higher exit valuations 
are particularly high for younger teams and teams with no 
serial entrepreneurs (that is, those that we considered to 
be ex ante long shot bets). These results are documented 
in Table 10 and again provide support for the idea that it 
was the longer-shot bets that were driving the outcomes 
we see.

5. Robustness checks 

Thus far we have documented that post-2005, startups 
in industry-segments that beneﬁted from the introduction 
of  cloud  computing  experienced  a  shift  towards  ‘long 
shot  bets’  and  that  VCs  changed  the  way  in  which  they 
managed their portfolios towards a ‘spray and pray’ invest- 
ment strategy. We posit that a core channel driving these 
results was the fall in initial cost of founding new ventures 
following the introduction of cloud computing services by 
Amazon Web Services. Since this technological shock sub- 
stantially lowered the initial costs needed to be incurred in 
order to learn about startups’ viability, this was equivalent 
to  a  falling  cost  of  experimentation  and  made  the  real 
options taken by VC investors in the ﬁrst round of funding 
much more valuable. We show how an increase in ‘long 
shot  bets’  due  to  the  fall  in  cost  of  starting  ﬁrms  arises 
as a natural consequence of this experimentation channel. 
Viewed through this lens of experimentation, it can also 
be  seen  that  a  natural  response  by  VCs  to  long  shot 
bets is to shift to a ‘spray and pray’ investment strategy, 
putting a small amount of money into a larger number of 
ﬁrms, but reducing their governance of these ﬁrms until 
they have learned whether the startup ﬁnds intermediate 
success. 

An important element of the narrative presented above 
is  that  the  introduction  of  AWS  primarily  impacted  the 

initial investment decisions of investors – thereby chang- 
ing  the  cost  of  initial  experiments.  To  validate  this,  we 
provide  direct  evidence  to  conﬁrm  that  the  shock  had  a 
ﬁrst-order impact on the size of ﬁrst rounds, but had little 
measurable  effect  on  total  fundraising  by  startups  over 
the  subsequent  ﬁve  years.  Table  11  presents  regression 
estimates of log of total capital raised for each year after 
the  ﬁrm’s  ﬁrst  ﬁnancing  event  (up  to  ﬁve  years).  The 
sample  includes  ﬁnancings  of  VCs  who  are  active  both 
pre-  and  post-shock  and  the  models  include  VC  ﬁrm 
ﬁxed effects. The estimates make clear that the relatively 
smaller  ﬁnancings  in  treated  industries  are  conﬁned  to 
the early years of ﬁrms. By three years after their initial 
capital  raise,  ﬁrms  in  treated  and  untreated  industries 
exhibit  no  difference  in  capital  raised.  This  is  important 
because many alternative explanations that relate to differ- 
ent investment opportunities are about the level of capital 
required to run a business. Our evidence strongly suggests 
that  AWS  impacted  initial  startup  cost  rather  than  total 
cost, and hence restricts the set of potential explanations 
considerably. Relatedly, in unreported results we repeat the 
exercise studying ﬁrst capital raised in Table 3 for second- 
round ﬁnancing size. We again ﬁnd little evidence that the 
funding size changes outside of ﬁrst-round ﬁnancings. 

While our results are consistent with an experimenta- 
tion channel and the timing consistent with the introduc- 
tion  of  AWS,  our  identiﬁcation  is  also  predicated  on  the

assumption that no other systematic change in 2006 im- 
pacted precisely the set of ﬁrms we classify as treated, in 
a manner consistent with our ﬁndings but through some 
other channel. We therefore examine the predictions from 
a  set  of  alternative  channels  and  discuss  the  extent  to 
which they can also explain our ﬁndings. We address three 
such potential channels in detail below. 

First, we document that our results are not driven by 
any changes due to the ﬁnancial crisis, which manifested 
itself relatively brieﬂy in the venture capital industry to- 
wards the end of our sample and was mostly conﬁned to 
2009. For example, while there was a 25% fall in the num- 
ber of deals from 2008 to 2009, deal volume actually in- 
creased 15% from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, since our speci- 
ﬁcation includes year ﬁxed effects, alternative explanations 
must  include  a  reason  why  treated  industries  were  im- 
pacted differentially in a manner that accounts for our re- 
sults. If anything, one might expect the crisis to have had 
the opposite effect, by leading investors to cut back more 
on the most capital-intensive industries such as biotech- 
nology and energy – which were unaffected by AWS. Nev- 
ertheless, we ﬁnd that excluding new ﬁnancings in the ﬁrst 
full year of the ﬁnancial crisis (2009) has no material im- 
pact on our results. 

Second,  we  examine  other  technological  shocks  that 
may have changed investment opportunities for VCs. Two 

potential  candidates  are  the  growth  of  open-source  soft- 
ware and the iPhone and its resulting mobile ecosystem. 
We perform several tests to show these are unlikely to be 
the drivers of the changes we see in our context. We use 
the Google feature that has tracked search term frequency 
on their search engine since 2004 to compare search traﬃc 
for Amazon EC2 to these alternative events. Fig. A.1 in the 
Appendix shows the rapid increase in the search for “EC2”
after 2005, which is in line with our identiﬁcation assump- 
tions. The next two ﬁgures in the Appendix show search 
traﬃc for the App Store ( Fig. A.2 ) and open-source soft- 
ware ( Fig. A.3 ). For the App Store, the interest level only 
rose in 2008, well after the shock we study and towards 
the end of our sample period. As a second test, we exclude 
ﬁrms from our sample that had a mention of mobile appli- 
20 
cations, iPhones, Android, and other similar technologies. 
This is to ensure that what we capture is not simply the 
impact of smart phones and mobile applications changing 
the opportunity set for VCs, impacting both the character- 
istics of portfolio companies and the investment strategy 
of  VCs.  The  exclusion  of  this  subsample  has  no  material 
impact on our estimates, so we conclude that our results

customers provided by VentureSource to identify such ﬁrms.

are not primarily driven by the introduction of the iPhone. 
Turning next to open-source, there is a perception that im- 
provement and dissemination of certain programming lan- 
guages such as Ruby on Rails, PHP, and Python may have 
increased during our sample period, making it cheaper to 
start  and  staff software  startups.  Our  search  for  the  fre- 
quency of the terms “open-source” as well as for Python, a 
popular programming language used for many VC-backed 
ﬁrms’  websites,  suggests  these  were  prevalent  well  be- 
fore  the  introduction  of  AWS  and  were  largely  constant 
across our time period. Fig. A.3 shows this pattern for the 
“open-source software” search. Ruby on Rails, which is an- 
other popular web programming framework introduced in 
July 2004, shows rapid increases in search frequency two 
years prior to the introduction of AWS and so is also un- 
likely to have driven these changes. More generally, how- 
ever,  we  should  note  that  the  role  that  these  program- 
ming languages may have played is in fact consistent with 
the  thrust  of  our  model.  The  cost  of  starting  businesses 
has fallen in software and other industries as well, making 
abandonment options more valuable for VCs and leading to 
a shift towards a new investment strategy. Empirically, we 
need to look for a large shock that differentially impacted 
some industries but not others, and we believe that AWS 
is such a shock and is one that practitioners have argued 

drove a large change in the cost of starting new ﬁrms. This 
analysis does not discount the potential role of other fac- 
tors such as open-source that may have also impacted the 
initial cost of starting businesses and impacted VC invest- 
ment through the experimentation channel. 

Third,  we  address  other  potential  channels  – such 
as  younger  entrepreneurs  needing  more  governance  and 
hence needing more staging, or entry by new intermedi- 
aries  driving  up  prices,  leading to  smaller investments –
that explain some of our results. To do so, we ﬁrst note 
that  the  experimentation  channel  predicts  that  a  fall  in 
the cost of learning should lead to less governance as in- 
vestors ‘spray and pray’ and that conditional on initial suc- 
cess, ﬁrms should receive higher step-ups in value across 
rounds – since ﬁrms that in fact succeed when they had 
a  small  chance  of  success  generate  a  signiﬁcant  amount 
of  information  that  is  incorporated  in  the  next  round’s 
prices. These two predictions are diﬃcult to generate to- 
gether through other channels. For example, if initial com- 
petition bid up prices, we should expect to see lower step- 
ups for ﬁrms that ultimately succeeded, while in fact, we 
ﬁnd the opposite is true. Alternatively, if the composition 
of entrepreneurs changed in ways that required more gov- 
ernance, we should see the increased staging (and smaller 
associated  rounds  of  funding)  come  hand  in  hand  with

Table 11 
Log capital raised by ﬁve years after ﬁrst VC. This table reports results from VC ﬁrm ﬁxed 
effects regressions of the log of total capital raised by each year after the entrepreneurial 
ﬁrm’s ﬁrst ﬁnancing event for ﬁrms that survived at least three years. Column 1 effectively 
reports the main capital raised result found in Table 3 . Column 2 measures capital stock as 
of two years later (similarly for the remaining columns). The sample considers only those 
investors that had investing activity before and after 2006. Industry ﬁxed effects control for 
the ﬁve industry groups: Biotechnology and health-care, Business and ﬁnancial services, Con- 
sumer goods and services, Energy and industrials, and Information technology. “Treated” in- 
dustries are deﬁned at a more granular-level than these industry classiﬁcations so there is 
within-industry variation in startups that are deﬁned as “treated” vs. not. “Year FE” indicate 
dummies for ﬁnancing year and “VC ﬁrm FE” are VC ﬁrm ﬁxed effects. Standard errors clus-

other forms of increased governance, such as VCs taking 
more board seats. Again, we ﬁnd the opposite is true. 

6. Entry of new intermediaries and trajectory of 
innovation 

Aside from examining alternative channels, we also run 
robustness checks on our estimation equation, by modify- 
ing the difference-in-difference speciﬁcation in two ways. 
To address the concern that our controls for industry and 
time are insuﬃcient to capture aggregate trends that co- 
incided with the introduction of AWS, we include a linear 
time trend in each of the models. Doing so does not im- 
pact the results. It is possible that AWS simply coincided 
with other events in the 20 0 0s that were not proxied by 
the  cloud  or  open-source  measures  discussed.  First  note 
that the patterns observed in Fig. 2 provide no evidence 
that  the  results  are  driven  by  years  immediately  around 
the treatment date. As an alternative test, we thus move 
the treatment year back and forward one year – 2005 and 
2006  – to  understand  whether  the  results  are  a  general 
phenomenon  of  the  time  period.  We  estimate  the  main 
models  where  2005  is  the  treatment  year  and  2006  is 
the post-treatment year. Similarly, we estimate the mod- 
els where 2006 is the pre-treatment year and 2007 is the 
post-treatment  year.  If  there  was  no  other  shock  in  the 
years surrounding the introduction of AWS, then these es- 
timates should be signiﬁcantly attenuated relative to our 
core results. For capital raised and the other major vari- 
ables, the results are insigniﬁcant with these speciﬁcations, 
further bolstering the effect being related to a shock expe- 
rienced in 2006. 

6.1. Entry 

A natural implication of our results is that we should 
see  an  increase  in  ﬁnancial  intermediaries  who  special- 
ize  in  ‘spray  and  pray’  investing.  This  is  consistent  with 
a  rise  in  VC  funds  focusing  on  early  stage  investing,  of- 
ten referred to as ‘Micro VCs’ or ‘Seed Funds.’ Our analysis 
also highlights the counterintuitive notion that governance 
by VCs seems to have fallen for precisely the stages and 
the types of entrepreneurs who might need it the most. It 
suggests that a natural response to the fact that VCs have 
shifted their emphasis from governance to learning in the 
early stages of a venture would be entry of ﬁnancial inter- 
mediaries that specialize in scalable forms of mentorship 
and governance in the early stages of a venture’s life. 

In  fact,  there  has  been  massive  entry  by  new  in- 
termediaries  known  as  accelerators,  deﬁned  as  “ﬁxed, 
cohort-based  programs,  including  mentorship  and  edu- 
cational  components  that  culminate  in  a  public  pitch  or 
demo day” ( Hochberg, 2016; Cohen and Hochberg, 2014 ). 
Cohen and Hochberg (2014) note that the ﬁrst accelerator, 
Y-Combinator,  was  founded  in  2005.  Today,  estimates  of 
the number of accelerators range from 300 to over 20 0 0. 
Accelerators also help to screen deal ﬂow for VCs through 
forums  such  as  ‘demo  day,’  making  the  search  process 

440 

M. Ewens et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 128 (2018) 422–442 

for  long  shot  bets  more  eﬃcient.  In  fact,  Paul  Graham, 
referring to Y-Combinator, notes that “We’re not a replace- 
ment for venture capital funds. We occupy a new, adjacent 
niche... our m.o. is to create new deal ﬂow, by encouraging 
hackers  who  would  have  gotten  jobs  to  start  their  own 
startups instead. We compete more with employers than 
VCs.”21  Similarly,  in  studying  a  prominent  accelerator, 
Gonzalez-Uribe  and  Leatherbee  (2017)  ﬁnd  the  primary 
role it plays is that of mentorship, and ﬁnd limited direct 
effect of ﬁnancing it provides to new ventures. 

6.2. Trajectory of Innovation 

The  effect  that  such  a  shift  in  the  investment  strat- 
egy  has  on  innovation  is  ambiguous.  On  the  one  hand, 
it  is  likely  to  increase  the  chances  of  radical  new  busi- 
ness models – companies such as Airbnb, that was founded 
by young, inexperienced entrepreneurs and was by all ac- 
22  On the 
counts a “long shot bet” when it was founded. 
other  hand,  the  shift  in  investment  strategy  is  likely  to 
make it much harder for more complex technologies where 
the costs of experimentation are higher or where there is 
a slower revelation of information about the startup’s ﬁnal 
value. For example, the very long time frames and costs 
associated with learning about the potential of renewable 

21 Source:  http://paulgraham.com/ycombinator.html .  Cohen  et  al. 
(2017) provide further empirical support for this notion by documenting 
the extremely small amounts that accelerators invest on average, if they 
invest at all. 
22 For example, Kerr et al. (2014b) highlight how Fred Wilson of Union 
Square Ventures wrote about his “regret” at passing on Airbnb, a startup 
that lets people rent rooms or homes to prospective guests online. Started 
in 2008, Airbnb currently lists 500,000 properties in more than 34,0 0 0 
cities across 192 countries, far larger than any hotel chain, thereby mak- 
ing it the largest lodging company and brand in the world ( Levere, 2013 ). 
Fred Wilson writes of Union Square Ventures’ decision to pass on the 
deal in 2009 that “we couldn’t wrap our heads around air mattresses on 
the living room ﬂoors as the next hotel room.... Others saw the amaz- 
ing team that we saw, funded them, and the rest is history.” (Source: 
http://avc.com/2011/03/airbnb/ ). 

energy technologies or cancer therapies have led to rela- 
tively little ﬁnancing of such ventures, despite intense so- 
cietal interest ( Fernandez et al., 2012; Nanda et al., 2015 ). 

7. Conclusion 

We study rich, novel data on the characteristics of VC- 
backed ﬁrms to show how technological shocks to the ini- 
tial cost of starting new ﬁrms have had a fundamental im- 
pact on the way in which investors manage their portfo- 
lios  and  the  types  of  companies  they  choose  to  ﬁnance. 
The  falling  cost  of  experimentation  makes  abandonment 
options for investors much more valuable and this directly 
impacts the types of ﬁrms that investors are willing to ﬁ- 
nance, as well as the investment strategy they choose to 
use.  In  particular,  we  show  how  technological  shocks  to 
the cost of experimentation can play a central role in shap- 
ing both the rate and trajectory of startup innovation, by 
allowing more long shot bets to receive initial funding and 
thereby also reducing the chance of ‘false negatives’ in the 
economy. Nevertheless, this comes hand in hand with an 
investment strategy where several startups receive a small 
initial investment, but who do not get follow-on funding 
when intermediate information is negative. We show how 
this adaptation of investors towards a “spray and pray” in- 
vestment strategy will tend to increase VC investment in 
startups where information is revealed quickly and cheaply 
and hence may adversely impact the extent to which more 
complex technologies, where information is revealed more 
slowly, are funded. In doing so we document the important 
feedback between technological change and ﬁnancial inter- 
mediaries – technological shocks to investment opportuni- 
ties require adaptation by investors, but this adaption has 
consequences for the future trajectory of innovation.
