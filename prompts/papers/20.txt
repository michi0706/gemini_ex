Congressional committees play a central role in policymaking, and the members of the most important com-
mittees are thought to be particularly powerful, but committee chairs have received less scholarly attention. We
study the eﬀects of congressional committee positions on legislative inﬂuence—analyzing legislative eﬀective-
ness, campaign contributions, and the implied value of being lobbied—and utilizing a within-member design
that allows us to distinguish the eﬀects of committee positions from selection into committee positions. We ﬁnd
little evidence that a seat on an important committee makes a member of Congress more powerful, but members
do experience a signiﬁcant increase in power when they become chair of a committee. Our results suggest that
much of the power associated with committee positions in Congress is concentrated among a small set of chairs
that play a disproportionate role in policymaking.

Because of their importance for policymaking, legislative commit-
tees are a central topic of study in political economy. For the U.S.
Congress, the consensus is that committee membership is a key driver of
legislative inﬂuence—particularly membership on historically im-
portant committees like Appropriations, Rules, and Ways and Means in
the House. Surprisingly, committee chairs have received relatively little
attention in the literature. In this paper, we attempt to provide the most
comprehensive study of committee positions, including chairs, on a
member's power and inﬂuence in Congress. Our results suggest that
much of the power of committees is concentrated among chairs.

Committees and committee chairs received signiﬁcant attention in
sociological, ethnographic, and qualitative studies of committees ex-
empliﬁed by Fenno (1966, 1973), Manley (1970). This scholarship fo-
cused on the internal workings of speciﬁc committees and the re-
lationships between committees and the full chamber. A general theme
is that committees matter but they diﬀer in their inﬂuence and their
internal operations. The role and inﬂuence of chairs varies across
committees, but chairs always play a prominent role as leaders who use
their formal and informal powers guide the committee's operation and
decisions. Among other things, chairs are thought to have their own
unique leadership styles (Evans, 1991), inﬂuence the roll-call votes of
other members (Matthews and Stimson, 1975), creatively expand the

jurisdiction of their committee (Talbert et al., 1995), and participate
more in committee deliberations (Hall, 1987, 1996), and all of these
factors are thought to inﬂuence a committee's legislative success.

Chairs have received less attention with the emergence of formal
models of Congress (e.g., Cox and McCubbins, 1993; Shepsle and
Weingast, 1981). In these accounts, the focus is often on committee
members or party leaders, and chairs are sometimes described as agents
of the majority party. To the extent that the recent quantitative lit-
erature has devoted attention to chairs, the main topic has been the
process by which chairs are selected. Although committee assignments,
including chair positions, are formally chosen by majority vote in the
chamber, chairs have historically been allocated by seniority. Violations
of the seniority rule were rare through most of the 20th century, but the
seniority norm weakened with a series of reforms initiated in the 1970s
and further eroded following the election of a new Republican majority
in 1994 (Aldrich et al., 2013; Jenkins and Stewart III, 2016). The in-
dependent inﬂuence of chairs is thought to have decreased in recent
decades due to their increased reliance on the support of their party.
While the idea that committee chairs are important is not new, prior
empirical studies have typically focused on only one committee or one
outcome, and often do not account for selection bias. Committee chair
positions are clearly desirable, as evidenced by low retirement rates

(Hall and Van Houweling, 1995). Chairs have higher legislative eﬀec-
tiveness scores (Volden and Wiseman, 2014, 2016) and are lobbied
more often (Hojnacki and Kimball, 1999). Some studies have docu-
mented increases in campaign contributions for committee chairs
(Ansolabehere and Snyder, 1998–1999; Ansolabehere et al., 2002;
Romer et al., 1994), although these analyses are often not the primary
focus of these studies. Cohen et al. (2011) ﬁnd that chairs of important
committees generate more federal spending in their states, but Snyder
and Welch (2015) call that study into question. Gropper et al. (2013)
ﬁnd that banks achieve higher returns when the chair of a congressional
banking committee is from the state of their headquarters. Roberts
(1990) examines the death of the ranking minority member of the
Senate Armed Services committee and concludes that it harmed ﬁrms
connected to the former senator but beneﬁted ﬁrms connected to his
successor on the committee. Berry and Fowler (2016) ﬁnd that the
chairs of Appropriations subcommittees but not the chairs of author-
izing committees generate more federal spending for their constituents
within the domain of their subcommittee. Examining state legislatures,
Fouirnaies (2017) ﬁnds that committee chairs garner more campaign
contributions, and this eﬀect is greater when the chair has more formal
power.

To further understand the role of committees and chairs in the
policymaking process, we attempt to provide the most comprehensive
study of committee positions, including chairs, on a member's power
and inﬂuence in Congress. We utilize a within-member diﬀerences-in-
diﬀerences design that allows us to disentangle the eﬀects of committee
positions from selection into committee positions, and we utilize sev-
eral diﬀerent outcome measures—legislative eﬀectiveness
scores,
campaign contributions, and the implied value of being lobbies—that
capture various aspects of a member's inﬂuence. In general, gaining a
seat on an important committee only modestly increases a member's
inﬂuence, but becoming chair of a committee signiﬁcantly increases a
member's inﬂuence. When possible, we test whether the eﬀect of
committee positions changed after the 1994 election, as predicted in the
literature, and although we do detect some changes, we still detect
meaningful eﬀects of chairs in the modern era. In the case of campaign
contributions, we conduct additional tests within industries and show
that committee membership can increase campaign contributions from
related industries, although becoming chair dramatically increases
campaigning contributions from both related and unrelated industries.
Lending further credibility to our results, we rule out the possibility that
our estimates are plagued by committee seniority, and we obtain nearly
identical results using an instrumental variables strategy that is not
plagued by the potentially non-random violations of the seniority norm.
Lastly, we ﬁnd evidence of anticipatory eﬀects in the case of campaign
contributions but not legislative eﬀectiveness, meaning that some so-
phisticated contributors appear to predict who will become chair and
begin contributing to those members beforehand.

Our results will probably be most interesting to political economists
who want to understand how political institutions shape the policy-
making process. Furthermore, because we utilize campaign contribu-
tions as one measure of power and inﬂuence, our results also contribute
to the literature on money in politics. The fact that chairs—senior
legislators who are typically electorally safe—receive a large bump in
campaign contributions may tell us something about the motivations of
contributors. Some contributors appear less interested in inﬂuencing
election results and more interested in supporting incumbents who are
expected to win and be powerful in the next session, suggesting that
these contributors hope that their donation will buy some kind of policy
favor (e.g., Baron, 1989). And we ﬁnd evidence that some contributors,
particular institutional contributors, are quite sophisticated, giving not
to those who are chair now but those who will be chair in the near
future. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that these con-
tributions are made for consumption (Ansolabehere et al., 2003), and
perhaps contributors get more consumption when they give to im-
portant members who are frequently covered in the news. In any case,

our evidence suggests that the current structure of institutions in Con-
gress allows a small number of committee chairs to disproportionately
inﬂuence the policymaking process.

1. Theoretical motivation

Although there is little empirical evidence on the importance of
committee chairs, we believe there are good substantive and theoretical
reasons to suspect that these institutional positions are rather im-
portant. The chair is essentially the committee's agenda setter (Oleszek
et al., 2016, pp. 116–133). In the contemporary Congress, her authority
includes the ability to hire, ﬁre, and direct most committee staﬀ, refer
bills to subcommittees, schedule or block hearings and markup, and run
committee meetings. The chair wields both positive and negative
agenda control. When she opposes a bill, she may delay or refuse to
schedule hearings, withhold staﬀ resources, or invite opponents of the
bill to testify. When she favors a bill, she may refer it to a friendly
subcommittee, schedule expeditious hearings, devise parliamentary
strategy, represent it favorably to the media, devote staﬀ attention to it,
and see that it gets ﬂoor action. After a bill is passed, the relevant
committee chair typically proposes a slate of members to serve on the
conference committee and serves on the committee herself, and after a
law is enacted, the chair can schedule more hearings to inﬂuence the
way bureaucrats implement the law.

Among the chair's greatest agenda-setting powers is the ability to
craft the document that will be used by the committee for markup
purposes. The chair may elect to use a bill as introduced by another
member or direct staﬀ to make changes to the document that reﬂect the
chair's own policy preferences (Schneider, 2014). Importantly, the
committee starts with the text as delivered to them by the chair. This
draft is commonly referred to as “the chair's mark,” and forms the
starting point for committee negotiations. Moreover, any changes to the
chair's mark must be approved by a majority vote of the committee.

The chair's role with respect to the committee closely resembles that
of the agenda setter in canonical models of spatial policymaking
(McKelvey, 1976; Romer and Rosenthal, 1978, 1979) or distributive
politics (Baron and Ferejohn, 1989). In these models, the proposer can
often achieve favorable policy outcomes or extract a signiﬁcant portion
of resources for herself because voting against her proposal is costly,
either because extra rounds of voting are costly or because the policy
will revert to an undesirable outcome.2 More recent distributive models
suggest that the ﬁrst proposer can extract virtually all of the available
resources when passage of a proposal does not require unanimity and
when some committee members have no chance of being the proposer
in the next period (Ali et al., 2014), and both of these conditions appear
to be met in congressional committees. In other words, combining
substantive knowledge about chairs with existing models produces a
clear prediction that becoming committee chair should signiﬁcantly
increase a member's ability to pursue her legislative agenda, garner a
greater share of distributive resources, and generally inﬂuence policy.
We test this prediction empirically utilizing several measures of legis-
lative inﬂuence.

2. Methodology

Some aspects of legislative power may derive from the individual
characteristics of legislators themselves, such as their charisma, bar-
gaining ability, fund-raising acumen, or parliamentary skill. We are

2 There are qualiﬁcations to the power of agenda setters in these kinds of models. For
example, when policy is multidimensional, sophisticated committee members can
sometimes limit the power of the agenda setter by voting against their sincere interests
(Shepsle and Weingast, 1984), and there can even be situations where proposal power
makes a committee member worse oﬀ (Anesi and Seidmann, 2014). Our empirical results
cannot resolve theoretical debates within the agenda-setting literature, but we show that
as predicted by most models, agenda setters are indeed powerful in the U.S. Congress.

interested, however, in the extent to which a member's legislative in-
ﬂuence is determined by the committee positions she holds. In order to
separate the eﬀect of committee positions from eﬀects of the innate
attributes of the legislator, our primary research design is a within-
member diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences design. For each measure of power
and inﬂuence, we estimate the following equation using OLS:
Outcome

where γi represents legislator ﬁxed eﬀects, accounting for observable
and unobservable diﬀerences across members, and δt represents time
ﬁxed eﬀects, accounting for natural variation of the outcome over time.
CommitteePositionit is typically a binary variable indicating whether a
legislator holds a particular committee position in that particular year,
and we often include multiple committee indicators in the same re-
gression. We also include an indicator for membership in the majority
party to account for the fact that changes in committee positions often
coincide with changes in the majority party, which itself may inﬂuence
the power and inﬂuence of a member. This also allows us to compare
the eﬀect of committee positions to that of being in the majority party, a
comparison of substantive relevance in the literature.3 This design
implicitly accounts for the possibility that legislative inﬂuence increases
linearly with chamber seniority because every member gains seniority
at the same rate.4 We later show that controlling for committee se-
niority has no impact on our subsequent results. For simplicity and ease
of interpretation, we drop cases where a member changes parties in the
middle of the term, and we drop cases where a member is a party leader
and has no committee positions. When we deviate from this basic
structure in a particular analysis, we explain the diﬀerences.

Assuming that members joining or leaving a particular committee
position follow parallel trends, on average, compared to those from the
same party who do not join or leave that position, β represents the
average eﬀect of the committee position for those members who ac-
quire or lose that position within our period of analysis.5 We prefer a
within-member design because selection onto committees will plague
any cross-sectional comparison of those with and without a particular
position. For example, if a seat on Appropriations is desirable, we might
expect the most competent, ambitious legislators to join that com-
mittee. So if we ﬁnd that members on Appropriations are more inﬂu-
ential than those oﬀ the committee, we will have no way of knowing
whether that diﬀerence is attributable to the committee position or to
the natural diﬀerences between those who are able or unable to join the
committee. See Berry and Fowler (2016) for more discussion and evi-
dence of selection onto committees. Our design accounts for diﬀerences
between legislators and estimates the eﬀect of committee positions by
leveraging within-member changes.

3. Data and measures

The exercise of power within Congress is diﬃcult to observe di-
rectly. Legislative power involves, at a minimum, a member's ability to
write and pass legislation advancing her own policy agenda, to shape

3 Alternatively, we can more ﬂexibly account for majority-party eﬀects and other
idiosyncratic trends within party by including time-party ﬁxed eﬀects rather than time
ﬁxed eﬀects. This approach, which we utilize whenever we are not interested in esti-
mating the eﬀect of majority party status, produces nearly identical estimates of com-
mittee eﬀects.

4 We have implemented speciﬁcations that control for higher order polynomials of
chamber seniority, and this has no impact on our subsequent results. We have also im-
plemented speciﬁcations with congress-cohort-party ﬁxed eﬀects, allowing for any kind
of seniority eﬀect, and we obtain similar point estimates, although with this speciﬁcation,
we lose statistical power as well as the ability to compute state-clustered standard errors.
5 We will discuss the parallel trends assumption in more detail later. Also, in the
Appendix, we show that we obtain nearly identical results for chairs using an instru-
mental variables design which makes diﬀerent and arguably weaker identifying as-
sumptions.

the content of legislation proposed by others, and the ability to inﬂu-
ence the votes of her colleagues. To these, one might add the ability to
inﬂuence the behavior of external actors, such as bureaucratic agencies
or the other chamber of Congress. Recognizing that we cannot directly
observe all of the activities just described, we utilize several proxies for
the extent to which members of Congress are able to inﬂuence the
legislative process. We believe that a member's legislative inﬂuence,
however deﬁned, should be reﬂected in at least one of the measures we
study.

First, we utilize Volden and Wiseman's (2014) legislative eﬀective-
ness scores, which capture the extent to which bills sponsored by a
member move through the legislative process. Legislative eﬀectiveness
scores are designed to measure the extent to which a member moves
their policy proposals through the legislative process. To be overly
simplistic, legislators receive higher scores when they sponsor more
bills, when those bills move further through the legislative process, and
when those bills are classiﬁed as substantive and/or signiﬁcant; see
Volden and Wiseman (2014) for more details.

While legislative eﬀectiveness is a straightforward measure of
power and inﬂuence over the legislative process, we explore additional
measures for several reasons. First, certain aspects of power and in-
ﬂuence may not be reﬂected in the sponsoring and outcomes of bills.
Second, members of Congress can appear to be eﬀective according to
this measure without actually exerting much independent inﬂuence.
For example, a chair might appear to be eﬀective because they in-
troduce a lot of bills, but if they are simply doing the bidding of the
majority party, they may not be particularly powerful or inﬂuential
themselves (Adler and Wilkerson, 2013). This would happen when the
chair is listed by custom as the sponsor of the committee's must-pass
legislation, for example. In such situations, the legislative eﬀectiveness
scores may be misleading.6 Therefore, our next set of analyses focuses
on campaign contributions.

Presumably, if committee positions make legislators more inﬂuen-
tial in the policymaking process, this should increase their ability to
raise money for their campaigns. One reason is that more powerful
members of Congress are more publicly visible and more able to raise
money from organizations and individuals who derive consumption
value from contributing (e.g., Ansolabehere et al., 2003). Another po-
tential reason is that access-oriented contributors try to target the most
inﬂuential members in order to obtain more information or exert
greater inﬂuence in the policymaking process. Empirical evidence
suggests that incumbents receive a signiﬁcant bump in campaign con-
tributions (Fouirnaies and Hall, 2014) and this bump is particularly
large for contributors who are more exposed to government regulation
(Fouirnaies and Hall, 2016). Therefore, increased campaign contribu-
tions could be a sign that contributors believe a member of Congress has
become more powerful. If on the other hand, committee chairs are
merely doing the bidding of others, those seeking to inﬂuence policy
should not bother courting chairs.

Much of the logic of this measure is that access-seeking contributors
can reasonably infer which members are inﬂuential and target their
spending accordingly. In that sense, campaign contributions measure
perceptions of power rather than actual power, and perceptions may
not necessarily match reality. However, because access-seeking con-
tributors closely observe policymaking within their domains and be-
cause they have strong incentives to ﬁgure out who is powerful, their
perceptions are likely to be reliable. Furthermore, even if we don't trust
the perceptions of contributors, campaign donations themselves pro-
vide a signiﬁcant beneﬁt to members that can be translated into policy
inﬂuence. Additional campaign funds increase the chances that a

6 However, Volden and Wiseman (2016) argue that few pieces of legislation in the
modern Congress are actually “must pass,” and therefore, high legislative eﬀectiveness
scores must reﬂect some degree of eﬀectiveness regardless of a member's committee
positions.

member is reelected and can also be used to garner the support of other
members in order to pass their legislative priorities (Powell, 2017). In
short, even if campaign contributions are uncompelling as an indirect
measure of legislative inﬂuence, perhaps because contributors wrongly
perceive power within the legislature, contributions directly increase a
member's legislative power, which further justiﬁes their usefulness as a
measure of inﬂuence. In implementing these tests, we extend the work
of Romer et al. (1994), Ansolabehere and Snyder (1998–1999), and
Grimmer and Powell (2016) who also examine the eﬀect of committee
positions on campaign contributions, although Grimmer and Powell
utilize a research design that does not allow them to estimate the eﬀect
of chairs. All data on contributions come from Bonica (2013).

Lobbying provides a third way to measure, indirectly at least, the
power and inﬂuence of members of Congress. Presumably, if a member
becomes more powerful and exerts greater inﬂuence over policy, pro-
fessional lobbyists should work harder to lobby them—something we
cannot observe, and lobbyists with connections to those members
should be able to generate more revenue—something we can observe.
We follow Vidal et al. (2012) in estimating the eﬀect of professional
lobbyists' connections to members of Congress on their ability to gen-
erate revenue for their ﬁrms. They analyze data from 1998 to 2008 and
show that the revenue generated by professional lobbyists decreases
when a member of Congress that they previously worked for leaves
Congress. We utilize their data and basic research design while adding
data on committee chairs to test whether the committee positions of a
member inﬂuence the revenue generated by a lobbyist connected to
that member. As a member gains or loses a particular committee po-
sition, how does the revenue of a connected lobbyist change as a result?
As with campaign contributions, lobbying revenue is an indirect
measure of power that partly relies upon the ability of access-seeking
organizations to infer which members are particularly inﬂuential.
Again, as with contributions, we suspect that this indirect measure is
somewhat reliable because these organizations closely observe the
legislative process and have strong incentives to eﬃciently target their
eﬀorts. Furthermore, as with contributions, lobbying also provides a
direct beneﬁt to members of Congress. In one leading view, lobbyists
subsidize members by increasing their resources and allowing them to
achieve more of their legislative goals (Hall and Deardorﬀ, 2006). So
lobbying is both an indirect measure of inﬂuence and also a resource
that directly impacts a member's legislative power.

Data on congressional committee membership come from Nelson
(1993) and Stewart and Woon (2011), made available on Charles
Stewart's website. Appropriations subcommittee membership data
come from House Appropriations Committee (2010) and Senate
Appropriations Committee (2008). Identiﬁcation comes from members
who switch committee positions at some point in our data set. For ex-
ample, when estimating the eﬀect of becoming chair of any committee
on legislative eﬀectiveness, we have 149 members who were both chair
and not chair at some point in our period of study.

4. Results

Our ﬁrst set of analyses, shown in Table 1, focuses on legislative
eﬀectiveness in the U.S. House from 1973 to 2012. The legislative ef-
fectiveness variable is scaled so that the mean is 1, so estimated eﬀect
sizes can be easily interpreted relative to this average.7Volden and
Wiseman (2014, 2016) show that chairs are more eﬀective than rank-
and-ﬁle members, and we extend this analysis to investigate more
speciﬁc relationships. In addition, our research design allows us to

7 The distribution of legislative eﬀectiveness scores is highly skewed to the right. We
have alternatively conducted all of our subsequent analysis using the natural logarithm of
legislative eﬀectiveness scores as the dependent variable, and the substantive results are
unchanged. However, we do not transform these scores for our main analyses in order to
follow the convention of Volden and Wiseman and to enable comparisons with their
estimates.

better distinguish the eﬀects of committee positions from selection of
high-ability members into committee positions.8 We focus on the House
because legislative eﬀectiveness scores are not yet available for the
Senate.

Column 1 estimates the eﬀect of membership on an important
committee. Following Shepsle (1989), we classify Appropriations,
Rules, and Ways and Means as the important committees in the House,
and in our later analyses, we classify Appropriations, Finance, Foreign
Relations, and Armed Services as the important committees in the
Senate. First, we conﬁrm Volden and Wiseman's ﬁnding that a member
is more eﬀective when she is in the majority party—about 1.3 points
more eﬀective. Also in Column 1, we ﬁnd that a rank-and-ﬁle seat on an
important committee, if anything, actually decreases eﬀectiveness. We
estimate that joining Appropriations, Rules, or Ways and Means in the
House decreases eﬀectiveness by .3 points, and this estimate is statis-
tically signiﬁcant. One potential explanation is that this committee
work takes time away from members' own legislative proposals, and
perhaps these committee positions allow members to exert inﬂuence in
other ways that are less readily observable. In any case, we ﬁnd no
evidence that a seat on an important committee beneﬁts a member's
legislative inﬂuence.

Column 2 adds an additional variable indicating whether a member
is a chair of an important committee. Here, we estimate that becoming
chair of an important committee increases a member's legislative ef-
fectiveness by 3 points, an eﬀect that is substantively larger than the
eﬀect of being in the majority and highly statistically signiﬁcant
(p < .001). In Column 3, we estimate the eﬀect of becoming chair of
any committee or any Appropriations subcommittee, and we ﬁnd large
eﬀects. The average eﬀect of a chair position is 2.9 points, and the
average eﬀect of becoming chair of an Appropriations subcommittee is
1 point, and both eﬀects are highly statistically signiﬁcant (p < .001).
Also in Column 3, we see that the estimated eﬀect of being in the
majority party shrinks when we include indicators for chairs of com-
mittees and Appropriations subcommittees, suggesting that some of the
eﬀect of majority party status is explained by the fact that a member
must be in the majority party in order to be a chair.

8 Volden and Wiseman do not claim to estimate causal relationships, but rather asso-
ciations between legislative eﬀectiveness and committee positions (see Volden and
Wiseman, 2014, p. 43, fn. 61).

In Column 4, we replicate the speciﬁcation from Column 3 but add
interactions. Speciﬁcally, we test whether the eﬀect of committee po-
sitions changed after the Republican revolution of 1994. As discussed
previously, some scholars suggest that when the Republicans took
control of the House, they took power away from committee chairs and
spread it more evenly across the majority party. We ﬁnd little evidence
that the eﬀect of committee or chair positions changed after the
Republican revolution. Rank-and-ﬁle membership on important com-
mittees has little eﬀect on legislative eﬀectiveness, but chair positions
have a large eﬀect, and these estimated eﬀects are comparable before
and after 1994. If anything, the eﬀect of being committee chair in-
creased after 1994. The results of this table suggest that a signiﬁcant
share of legislative inﬂuence in Congress is concentrated among the few
important chairs of committees and Appropriations subcommittees.

Interestingly, we also ﬁnd evidence of signiﬁcant selection into
chair positions. If we remove the member ﬁxed eﬀects from the re-
gression in Column 2, we see that chairs of important committees have
legislative eﬀectiveness scores that are 4.5 points higher than other
majority members of those committees, but our diﬀerences-in-diﬀer-
ences design estimates an eﬀect of only 3.0 points. Similarly, if we re-
move the member ﬁxed eﬀects from the regression in Column 3, the
coeﬃcient for chairs is 3.8 as opposed to 2.9. This suggests that the
kinds of members who become chairs were already more eﬀective
legislators before they became chair, an interesting ﬁnding in and of
itself that further suggests that cross-sectional comparisons of chairs
and rank-and-ﬁle members like those of Volden and Wiseman (2014)
will signiﬁcantly overstate the eﬀect of chair positions. Here, we ﬁnd
evidence of both signiﬁcant selection into chair positions and sub-
stantively meaningful eﬀects of chair positions.

Table 2 presents our results for campaign contributions in the U.S.
House which cover 1979–2012. Estimates for the Senate are similar but
statistically less precise. The dependent variable is the natural loga-
rithm of the total dollars raised by an incumbent member during an
electoral cycle.9 Incumbents who chose not to seek reelection are ex-
cluded,10 and we drop redistricting years where campaign contribu-
tions could potentially change because of changes in district boundaries
and where it can be diﬃcult to merge committee positions and cam-
paign contributions. In all other respects, the speciﬁcations in Table 2
are identical to those in Table 1.

According to our estimate in Column 1, joining an important com-
mittee increases campaign contributions by 4 percent, although this
estimate is not statistically signiﬁcant and smaller than the 6 percent
estimate associated with being a member of the majority party.
Therefore, rank-and-ﬁle membership on an important committee has
minor implications for a member's ability to raise money, and access-
oriented contributors don't seem to believe that a member has become
notably more inﬂuential as a result of joining one of these committees.
In Column 2, the estimated eﬀect of becoming chair of an important
committee is imprecisely measured, because there are only three im-
portant committees according to our classiﬁcation, but the point esti-
mate suggests that becoming chair of an important committee more

than doubles campaign contributions. In Column 3, we estimate the
eﬀect of becoming chair of any committee or any Appropriations sub-
committee. In both cases, the estimated eﬀect on campaign contribu-
tions is substantively large—68 and 69 percent, respectively—and
statistically signiﬁcant (p < .005) but not as large as the estimated
eﬀect of becoming chair of an important committee.11

Our results in Column 4 are consistent with the conjecture that
committee chairs became less powerful after the Republican revolution.
The estimated eﬀects of being chair of any committee or any
Appropriations subcommittee are smaller after 1994, although neither
diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant. The estimates suggest that the
average eﬀect of any chair position was about 0.92 log points before
and 0.52 afterward, and the average eﬀect of being chair of an
Appropriations subcommittee was 1.48 log points before and 0.36
afterward.12 Furthermore, these interactive eﬀects do not appear to
simply result from secular trends. When we vary the speciﬁc cutoﬀ for
the Republican revolution, the genuine cutoﬀ of 1994 yields the most
negative interactive coeﬃcient for Appropriations subcommittee chairs
and the second most negative interactive coeﬃcient for chairs, sug-
gesting a sudden change in the concentration of power after 1994.
Nonetheless, we do not have enough statistical precision to draw strong
conclusions from this analysis.

To summarize the results in Table 2, a seat on an important com-
mittee has little eﬀect on the campaign contributions of a member, but
becoming a committee chair has large eﬀects, suggesting that access-
oriented contributors assign little weight to committee membership but

9 We use the logarithm of contributions because contributions are highly skewed and
because this allows our coeﬃcients to be interpreted as proportionate changes. From the
deﬁnition of the natural log, the predicted proportionate change associated with joining a
committee is exp( ̂β) − 1, and the predicted proportionate change associated with leaving
a committee is exp(− ̂β) − 1. However,
̂β and − ̂β are close approximations to these
̂β, the approximation
̂β, and for large values of
numbers, respectively, for small values of
is bounded by the exact estimates—i.e., −[exp(− ̂β) − 1] ≤ ̂β ≤ [exp( ̂β) − 1] ∀ ̂β.
10 When a member retires, they typically do not raise meaningful campaign funds, so
we must drop a member's ﬁnal term. This form of attrition could potentially bias our
subsequent estimates if members retire strategically (i.e., because they failed to raise a lot
of money) and if the extent of strategic retirement depends upon whether a member is
chair. This concern is one reason that our analysis of legislative eﬀectiveness is arguably
cleaner and more straightforward, but in any case, we suspect strategic retirement is quite
rare among members of Congress who eventually become committee chairs. Almost all of
them serve long careers and appear to retire by choice at an old age.

11 The estimated eﬀect of being chair of any committee is not exclusively driven by the
estimated eﬀect of being chair of an important committee. When we explicitly estimate
the eﬀect of being chair of a non-“important” committee, we obtain a coeﬃcient of
.599—a 60 percent eﬀect, just below the average eﬀect across all committee reported in
Column 3.

12 To obtain the estimated eﬀect post 1994, we add the interactive and non-interactive
coeﬃcients together. Note that the main eﬀect associated with “post-1994” is subsumed
by the election cycle ﬁxed eﬀects. Also note that we cannot separately estimate the eﬀect
of majority party before and after 1994 because the Democrats held the majority for the
entire period before the Republican revolution. For large coeﬃcients, the interpretation
of log points as proportionate changes is less straightforward. For example, the coeﬃcient
of 1.48 suggests that as a member becomes chair of an Appropriations subcommittee,
their campaign contributions, on average, increase by more than 300 percent (exp
{1.48} − 1 ≈ 3.39), and as a member loses this chair position, their campaign con-
tributions, on average, decrease by 77 percent (−exp{−1.48} + 1 ≈ .77).

believe that committee chairs are particularly inﬂuential. We also ﬁnd
that the distribution of power in Congress appears to have shifted after
the Republican revolution, with committees and chairs becoming less
important, although in both periods, the eﬀect of becoming a chair is
notably higher than the eﬀect of being in the majority party or serving
as a rank-and-ﬁle member on an important committee.

Instead of examining all contributions, we can further narrow our
focus to contributions from PACs related to the industries governed by a
particular committee. If a committee position increases policy inﬂuence
within the domain of the committee, we should see a particularly large
increase in contributions from industries connected to the committee.
The Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) maintains a data set indicating
which industries are governed by 6 diﬀerent committees in the
House—Agriculture, Armed Services, Energy, Financial Services,
Natural Resources, and Transportation. CRP's classiﬁcations vary
slightly over time, so we take the most expansive deﬁnition and classify
an industry as related to a committee if it was ever connected to that
committee in any term by CRP. Then, for each committee, we calculate
the total contributions received by each member in each election cycle
from industries related to that committee. This allows us to test whether
joining or becoming chair of one of these 6 committees increases
campaign contributions from industries related to the domain of the
committee.

Table 3 presents the results of this analysis. The top panel tests
whether committee members or chairs get more contributions from
related industries. Grimmer and Powell (2016) show that being exiled
from the Energy Committee decreases energy contributions, and we
replicate this result with our design. In fact, we obtain the largest eﬀect
of committee membership for this particular committee. When we pool
across all 6 committees in Column 7, including cycle-party-industry
ﬁxed eﬀects and member-industry ﬁxed eﬀects, we estimate that
joining a committee increases contributions from related industries by
62 percent, and becoming chair increases related contributions by an
additional 73 percent over and above the eﬀect of being a committee
member. Therefore, within the domain of a committee, we detect large
eﬀects of committee membership and chair eﬀects that are more than
double the eﬀect of simply joining the committee. In Column 8, to il-
lustrate the extent of selection onto committees and into the position of
committee chair, we exclude member-industry ﬁxed eﬀects, leaving a
naive cross-sectional comparison of members, chairs, and non-mem-
bers. Here, the estimated eﬀect of committee membership and chairs
are approximately double the within-member estimates, suggesting that
committee members and chairs were already receiving signiﬁcantly
more contributions from related industries before joining the com-
mittee or becoming chair.

In the bottom panel of Table 3, we repeat the same analyses using

contributions from unrelated industries as the outcome instead. Here,
we detect virtually no eﬀect of committee membership on unrelated
contributions, but we continue to detect a large eﬀect for chairs. Be-
coming chair of one of these committees increases contributions from
unrelated committees by 52 percent. And because only 6 percent of a
committee member's contributions come from within the domain of
their committee, on average, the ﬁnancial implications of becoming
chair signiﬁcantly swamp those of simply becoming a rank-and-ﬁle
committee member.

Table 4 presents our lobbying results. Because this analysis focuses
on lobbyists rather than members of Congress, we deviate from the
basic design outlined in Eq. (1). In this case, each observation re-
presents a lobbyist-period, where periods represent 6-month intervals
for which lobbyist revenue can be measured. All regressions include
lobbyist ﬁxed eﬀects and period-party ﬁxed eﬀects, where the party of
each lobbyist is deﬁned by the members of Congress that they pre-
viously worked for. Our analysis only includes lobbyists who previously

worked for a member of Congress, and in cases where a lobbyist worked
for multiple members from diﬀerent parties or for a member that
changed parties, we create a separate category of ambiguous parti-
sanship. Period-party ﬁxed eﬀects capture the possibility of diﬀerential
time trends for lobbyists from diﬀerent parties. We might expect De-
mocratic lobbyists to perform better when the Democrats are in control,
and vice versa. Following Vidal et al. (2012), the dependent variable is
the natural logarithm of revenue per lobbyist, and all independent
variables are counts, indicating the number of members of Congress in a
particular category to which a lobbyist is connected. Because the vast
majority of lobbyists are only connected to one member, in most cases
these variables take values of 0 or 1, and the results are unchanged if we
recode all of these variables as binary indicators.

Blanes I Vidal, Draca, and Fons-Rosen ﬁnd that connections to
members of the Senate Finance or House Ways and Means commit-
tees—arguably the most desirable committees in each chamber—are
particularly valuable, and we replicate this result in Column 1. We in-
clude variables for connections to any member of the House, any
member of the Senate, and members of Senate Finance and House Ways
and Means. Identiﬁcation of committee eﬀects comes from connected
members who join or leave these committees or from committee
members who leave oﬃce. A connection to a member of the Senate
Finance Committee appears to increase a lobbyist's revenue by 24
percent (p = .054), and a connection to the House Ways and Means
Committee has an even larger 39 percent eﬀect (p = .010).

While these committee eﬀects are substantively large, the value of
being connected to the chairs, a relationship not investigated by Blanes
I Vidal, Draca, and Fons-Rosen, is even larger. In Column 2, we add
variables indicating connections to the chairs of these committees. A
connection to the Senate Finance chair increases revenue by 45 percent
over and above a connection to a regular member of Senate Finance
(p = .001), and a connection to the House Ways and Means chair in-
creases revenue by 18 percent, although this diﬀerence is not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. Put another way, a connection to the Senate Finance
chair increases revenue by 68 percent relative to a connection to a rank-
and-ﬁle senator, and a connection to the House Ways and Means chair
increases revenue by 55 percent relative to a rank-and-ﬁle member of
the House.

In Columns 3–5, we recode our committee variables to mirror our
previous analyses. In Column 3, we ﬁnd that a connection to any
member of an important committee in the House or Senate increases
revenue by 15 percent. In Column 4, we ﬁnd that a connection to any
chair of an important committee further increases revenue by an ad-
ditional 14 percent. In Column 5, we detect a small, positive eﬀect for
chairs of any committee, 7 percent, and a small, negative point estimate
for chairs of any Appropriations subcommittee. To summarize, con-
nections to a few important committees appear to be particularly va-
luable for lobbyists, suggesting that those committees are particularly
inﬂuential—or at least that the clients of lobbyists believe them to be
inﬂuential. By this measure, the chairs of these important committees
are signiﬁcantly more inﬂuential than the rank-and-ﬁle members of
these committees, consistent with our previous results. While important
committee seats appear to modestly increase the inﬂuence of a member
of Congress, much of the power of committees appears to be con-
centrated among chairs.

The preceding analyses utilize a within-member diﬀerence-in-dif-
ferences design to identify the eﬀect of committee positions on several
outcomes meant to reﬂect a member's inﬂuence within the chamber.
This design eﬀectively compares the average outcome in the years in
which the member held the committee position (e.g., chair of any
committee) to the average outcome in the years in which the member
did not hold the position while accounting for time trends. This design
implicitly assumes that the eﬀect of holding a committee position be-
gins when the member has stepped into the position. In other words, a
member does not gain the advantages associated with being a com-
mittee chair until after she has become chair. Yet sophisticated

observers might reasonably predict who will become chair of a parti-
cular committee in the near future: with rare exceptions, the longest
serving member of the majority party will become chair. Given the
predictability of the identity of future chairs, we might expect next-in-
line members to accumulate inﬂuence before becoming chair. Fellow
legislators who want to curry favor with future chairs may support
those legislators and thus increase their legislative eﬀectiveness scores.
Access-oriented contributors may look ahead and target future chairs,
increasing their campaign funds before they become chair. And simi-
larly, ﬁrms and interest groups who lobby may speciﬁcally target future
chairs, increasing the revenue of lobbyists connected to them before
they become chair.

To our knowledge, there is no formal, institutional power conferred
to soon-to-be chairs. Therefore, the extent to which a soon-to-be chair
will gain inﬂuence before actually becoming chair depends on the be-
havior and expectations of other actors. As discussed above, an antici-
patory eﬀect on legislative eﬀectiveness would require fellow legisla-
tors to look ahead and support the legislation of future chairs. For
campaign contributions, individuals and PACs would have to target
spending toward members likely to become chairs in the future. And
lobbyists would have to devote more attention to future chairs as well.
All of these anticipatory eﬀects are theoretically plausible, perhaps
particularly so for campaign contributions. Since most campaign con-
tributions are made in the latter half of a congressional term when
members are coming up for reelection, contributors might care less
about which members are powerful in the current term, and they may
care more about who will be powerful in subsequent terms.

We ﬁrst address these questions with an event history analysis, the
results of which are depicted in Fig. 1. The graph shows coeﬃcients
from diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences analyses which closely mirror our pre-
vious speciﬁcations. We regress legislative eﬀectiveness scores and
logged campaign contributions on member ﬁxed eﬀects, congress-party
ﬁxed eﬀects, and a series of binary variables indicating when a member
became or will become chair. Unfortunately, we do not have a long
enough time series of lobbying data to conduct this analysis for lob-
bying. Rather than employing a single indicator for chairs as we do in
our previous analyses, we code the number of terms before and after
becoming chair using separate indicators. Speciﬁcally, −2 indicates a
member who is not chair in the current term but will be in two terms,
−1 indicates a member who is not chair in the current term but will be
the next term, 0 indicates a member in her ﬁrst term as chair; 1 is a
member in her second term as chair; and 2+ indicates a chair with two
or more terms of experience as chair. Therefore, the omitted category
comprises situations where a member is not chair and will not be chair
within the next two terms.

In the case of legislative eﬀectiveness (top panel), there is little
evidence of a “pre-treatment” bump for those on the verge of becoming
chair. Virtually all of the beneﬁts of being chair—approximately a 3
point increase in legislative eﬀectiveness—are realized in the ﬁrst term
as chair, and remain relatively constant thereafter. This result partly
conﬂicts with those of Volden and Wiseman (2016) who report that the
eﬀectiveness of chairs increases with experience as chair. One ex-
planation for the discrepancy is that we utilize a within-member design
while Volden and Wiseman compare across members, and there could
be selection into experience as chair. The combination of these results
suggests that the kinds of members who become chair for many terms
are highly eﬀective, but more experience as chair does not necessarily
cause eﬀectiveness to increase.

With campaign contributions (bottom panel of Fig. 1), by contrast,
beneﬁts accumulate before a member actually becomes chair. Even two
and three terms out, would-be chairs are garnering about 40 percent
more contributions, and this advantage grows as a member gets closer
to being chair and as the number of terms as chair increases. The results
of the event-study suggest that, for contributions but not for legislative
eﬀectiveness, would-be chairs appear to realize the beneﬁts of their
position before becoming chair. A plausible explanation for this result is

The ﬁgure presents the results of diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences re-

that sophisticated contributors believe chairs are important,
ahead, and anticipate who will become chair in the near future.

look

Of course, other interpretations may also be consistent with the
results of our event history analysis. One possibility is that our results
on campaign contributions are confounded by committee seniority. The
members who are about to become chair are typically some of the most
senior members of their committee, and seniority might have an in-
dependent eﬀect over above being chair, which might explain why
these members receive more campaign contributions. Suppose, for ex-
ample, that legislative inﬂuence increases linearly with committee se-
niority and chairs are only important insofar as they have a lot of
committee seniority. In this case, our previous analyses that don't ex-
plicitly account for committee seniority would overstate the importance
of chairs, although previous evidence suggests that seniority in
Congress may not be as important as traditionally thought (Fowler and
Hall, 2015).

To account for the independent eﬀects of committee seniority, we
code a seniority variable based on the committee ranks reported by the
parties at the beginning of each congressional session and assembled by
Nelson (1993) and Stewart and Woon (2011). For each committee and
party, we rescale these ranks so that the most senior member of each
committee from each party takes a value of 1 and the most junior
member takes a value of 0. Then, for each congress, we compute the
maximum value of this variable for each member across all committees.
The resulting variable ranges from 0 to 1 and indicates the maximum
seniority of each member in each congress across all committees. In
Table 5, we regress legislative eﬀectiveness scores and logged campaign
contributions on an indicator for a chair of any committee, an indicator
for a ranking minority member of any committee, seniority, seniority
interacted with majority party status, member ﬁxed eﬀects, and

congress-party ﬁxed eﬀects. The coeﬃcient associated with seniority
gives the eﬀect of committee seniority for the minority party, and the
sum of this coeﬃcient and the interactive coeﬃcient give the eﬀect for
the majority party.

Somewhat surprisingly given the results in Fig. 1, we detect a po-
sitive eﬀect of committee seniority for legislative eﬀectiveness, parti-
cularly for the majority party, and a negative eﬀect of committee se-
niority for campaign contributions. We also detect a positive eﬀect of
becoming ranking minority member for campaign contributions but not
for legislative eﬀectiveness. Most importantly for our main conclusions,
the estimated eﬀect of chairs remains substantively large, statistically
signiﬁcant, and relatively unchanged, even after controlling for se-
niority. Despite the possibility of substantively meaningful seniority

Journal of Public Economics 158 (2018) 1–11

eﬀects, there is a robust, substantively large chair eﬀect over and above
committee seniority.

Another potential concern is that parallel trends assumption is
violated. Our identiﬁcation strategy requires that changes in our out-
come variables for members who gain or lose a chair would have, on
average, followed the same trend as other members had they never
been chair.13 One particular concern is that members are more likely to
attain the position of chair because they have become more powerful
and inﬂuential, rather than the other way around. Perhaps the pattern
in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 reﬂects the fact that members who are
becoming more inﬂuential are also more able to secure chair positions.
Fortunately for our purposes, there is only so much that an individual
member can do to make herself more likely to become chair in a given
term. The norm is that the member of the majority party that has served
longest on the committee will typically be chair. However, this norm is
sometimes violated, and it has been increasingly violated in more re-
cent Congresses. We might be particularly worried about reverse cau-
sation—i.e., increasing inﬂuence leading to a chair—in those cases in
which the seniority norm is violated.

In Table 6, we implement an instrumental variables strategy that
removes the potentially endogenous variation in chairs arising from
norm violations and focuses only on the plausibly exogenous variation
in chairs arising from retirements and majority party switches. We in-
strument for chairs using a binary variable indicating whether a
member is the longest serving member of the majority party on a
committee. The ﬁrst column presents diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences esti-
mates of the eﬀect of any chair position, closely mirroring the previous
speciﬁcations. On average, being chair of any committee appears to
increase legislative eﬀectiveness by 2.5 points and campaign con-
tributions by 68 percent. The ﬁnal three columns present our instru-
mental variables results. The second column shows the ﬁrst stage esti-
mates of the eﬀect of being the longest serving majority party member
on being chair. Becoming the longest serving member of the majority
party increases the chances of being chair by 46 percentage points in
the legislative eﬀectiveness sample, and 51 percentage points in the
campaign contributions sample. The diﬀerences between these two
estimates are explained by the diﬀerent time periods of these analyses.
In both cases, the ﬁrst stage eﬀect is statistically strong, with F-statistics
of 172 and 145, respectively. The third column shows the reduced form
eﬀects of being the longest serving majority member on legislative ef-
fectiveness and campaign contributions. Most importantly, the last
column shows the two-state least squares estimates of the eﬀect of any
chair on legislative eﬀectiveness and campaign contributions. These
estimates are very similar to the diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences estimates,
suggesting that the possibility of high-ability or high-power members
becoming chair does not meaningfully bias our results. Even if we just
focus on the more exogenous variation in chairs that arises from
changes in the identity of the longest serving majority member, our
estimates are virtually unchanged.14

13 The pattern we observe in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 does not necessarily mean that
the parallel trends assumption is violated. This assumption has to do with the counter-
factual world in which committee positions never change, so even though contributions
to chairs increase before they become chair, we don't know if they would have increased
had they not become chair. In other words, contributors who anticipate turnover and act
accordingly do not create a violation of parallel trends, they lead the eﬀect of chairs to
begin before a member actually becomes chair.

14 The exclusion restriction would be violated if there were some reason that being the
most senior member of the majority party inﬂuenced these outcomes for reasons un-
related to becoming chair. For example, seniority norms might lead the most senior
member to be more inﬂuential even if she is not chair. However, remember that our
design implicitly accounts for any linear eﬀect of chamber seniority, and we also control
for linear eﬀects of committee seniority in these speciﬁcations, although those controls do
not meaningfully aﬀect our estimates. Furthermore, we do not necessarily contend that
these instrumental variables estimates are unassailable or even superior to our diﬀer-
ences-in-diﬀerences results. However, we present them to address concerns about the
endogenous ascension of some members to chair, and we are reassured that both designs
produce nearly identical results.

As in Table 5, all speciﬁcations include member ﬁxed eﬀects, con-
gress-party ﬁxed eﬀects, and controls for ranking minority members,
committee seniority, and committee seniority interacted with the ma-
jority party.

Although we acknowledge that other interpretations are possible,
our preferred interpretation of Fig. 1 is that there are anticipatory ef-
fects of becoming chair that are realized before a member actually
becomes chair, and these eﬀects are large for campaign contributions
but not for legislative eﬀectiveness. In Table 7, we test this hypothesis
more explicitly. Speciﬁcally, we code four dummy variables indicating
diﬀerent situations in which a member can ﬁnd herself: not chair but
will be next term, chair now and next term, chair now but not next
term, and used to be chair. The omitted category includes those who are
not chair and will not be chair next term. We regress our outcomes of
interest on each of these four binary variables plus member ﬁxed eﬀects
and congress-party ﬁxed eﬀects.

If the eﬀects of chair arise from the direct, institutional power of
chairs in the present term, we would expect no eﬀect for those who are
not chair but will be in the next term and positive eﬀects for those who
are chair now, regardless of whether they will be chair in the future.
This is exactly what we ﬁnd in the case of legislative eﬀectiveness.
Alternatively, if there are anticipatory eﬀects from sophisticated actors
hoping to curry favor with future chairs, we should see a positive eﬀect
for those who are not chair but will be next term, and we should see
that the eﬀect of being chair is smaller when the chair will not be chair
in the next term. This is exactly what we ﬁnd in the case of campaign
contributions. We estimate that the best case scenario for a member is
when they are chair and will be chair in the next term. Second best is
actually when a member is not chair but will be chair in the next term.
And the estimated eﬀect of being chair but not chair in the next term is
still positive, although not statistically signiﬁcant and notably smaller
than the eﬀect of being chair now and in the next term. In this explicit
test of forward-looking behavior, campaign contributors appear to care
more about who will be chair next term than who is chair now.

contributors explains these patterns, we would expect that this pattern
is stronger among political action committees (PACs) as opposed to
individual contributors. PACs are institutional contributors giving on
behalf of ﬁrms and interest groups. We would expect them to be par-
ticularly strategic in their giving behavior and care about access to
politicians who will be powerful in the future. Many (but not all) in-
dividuals, on the other hand, are thought to give to their preferred
candidates in a non-strategic way. Column 3 of Table 7 replicates the
analysis in Column 2 but only for contributions from PACs. As expected,
the patterns detected previously are signiﬁcantly exacerbated for these
institutional contributors. We estimate a 112 percent eﬀect of not being
chair but being chair in the next term, and for those who are already
chair, the diﬀerence between being chair or not in the next term is
substantively large and highly statistically signiﬁcant (p = .001). To be
sure, we also see this pattern if we focus only on individual con-
tributors, some of which are likely strategic and access-seeking, but we
see far more evidence of anticipatory behavior among PACs. These
results also suggest that, if anything, our primary speciﬁcation under-
states the total beneﬁts of being chair, at least for campaign contribu-
tions, because a member starts to realize these beneﬁts before becoming
chair.

5. Conclusion

important committees—is

Across a number of diﬀerent measures, we ﬁnd that committee
chairs are particularly inﬂuential, but rank-and-ﬁle membership on
committees—even the most
less con-
sequential than previously thought. We readily acknowledge, of course,
that we cannot easily measure all aspects of policy inﬂuence. However,
we have attempted to observe inﬂuence indirectly through multiple
measures, and we ﬁnd it hard to imagine examples of legislative power
that would not be reﬂected in any of these outcomes to some extent. For
example, suppose a particular committee position increased the ability
of a member to inﬂuence her peers. This would be virtually impossible
for researchers to observe and quantify, but to the extent that campaign
contributors or lobbyists are aware of this eﬀect, it should be reﬂected
in our estimates. Nevertheless, we believe there is plenty of room for
future research to extend our research design to other outcomes and
expand our understanding of how committee positions inﬂuence
members' legislative fortunes.

Previous work has shown that the distribution of federal spending is
largely controlled by the leaders of the Appropriations subcommittees
(Berry and Fowler, 2016). Synthesizing these results with those of the
current study, chairs of Appropriations subcommittees, the so-call
“cardinals” of Congress, appear to exert signiﬁcant control over federal
spending, while the chairs of authorizing committees appear to exert
signiﬁcant power and inﬂuence over other aspects of policymaking.

Journal of Public Economics 158 (2018) 1–11

These results provide a new understanding of the concentration of
power within Congress; one small set of members wields dispropor-
tionate inﬂuence over spending and another small set wields dis-
proportionate inﬂuence over policy.

We suspect that our ﬁndings would not come as a shock to early
congressional scholars,
like Fenno, or to journalistic observers of
Congress, such as Munson (1993), who recognize committee chairs as
powerful, independent forces in the legislature. And yet our results
point to signiﬁcant gaps in current theoretical models of the U.S.
Congress, where chairs are omitted or disregarded. The gains-from-
trade model, for instance, emphasizes committee membership as the
key to acquiring inﬂuence and beneﬁts (e.g., Shepsle and Weingast,
1981), while partisan models portray chairs as errand boys for the
majority party (e.g., Cox and McCubbins, 1993). Our results challenge
both views, suggesting that power is more concentrated than the gains-
from-trade view suggests yet less centralized than partisan models
contend. Instead, our results suggest that we should spend more time
studying the inner workings of committees to understand why chairs
are so inﬂuential. A small number of committee chairs appear to exert
disproportionate inﬂuence in the making of public policy in the U.S.
Congress.
