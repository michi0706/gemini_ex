Abstract
This paper contributes to the debate on the impact of agricultural productivity on long run
economic development. It presents evidence that widespread adoption of clover contributed
to local economic development based on a panel of 56 Danish market towns. We adopt a
differences-in-differences approach augmented by an instrumental variable and ﬁnd that the
adoption of clover accounts for about 8 percent of the growth in market town population from
1672 to 1901. The analysis suggests that the effect of the adoption of clover on the process
of development was mediated by its impact on human capital formation.

1 Introduction

Whether and how agricultural productivity inﬂuences long run development is an important
question in the literature on growth and development (e.g. Schultz 1953; Lewis 1954; Rostow
1960). Theoretically, increased agricultural productivity would stimulate the transition to a
modern, industrial economy in the context of a closed economy. Yet, in open economies

increased agricultural productivity would reinforce specialization in agriculture and delay
the development of a modern economy (Matsuyama 1992; Galor and Mountford 2008).

In this paper, we leverage new evidence on this question by considering the introduction
of clover into Denmark,1 a country which has often been referred to as a case of “develop-
ment through agriculture” (Lampe and Sharp forthcoming). Our main analysis considers the
effect of the introduction of clover on the populations of market towns which relied on the
surrounding local market for their food supply and had a monopoly on the local agricultural
trade until the introduction of a liberalization in 1857. For these reasons, the market towns
and their local markets arguably would have strong similarities with a closed economy at
least until they lost their local monopolies. Our analysis also examines the extent to which
the effect persists during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and some of the
channels through which clover affected the agricultural sector.2

Our main analysis ﬁnds that the introduction of clover had a positive impact on market
town populations at least until 1870, and the estimated effects—although less precise—are
similar for later years. Additional analyses show that clover increased the local number of
cows, grain yields and human capital. Therefore, as the introduction of clover increased cow
herds, it is also likely to have facilitated the later take-off of a modern dairy sector. The
modern sector utilized centrifuges and steam power, and arguably played a central role in
the Danish economic take-off (Henriksen et al. 2012; Jensen et al. 2018) as emphasized by
Danish economic historians (Lampe and Sharp forthcoming). Clover may increase agricul-
tural productivity in two principal ways. First, clover serves to increase nitrogen supply in
the soil, which increases crop yields (e.g. Kjærgaard 1995). In fact, the supply of nitrogen
governs the yields of crops, such as wheat, barley, and rye, when they have enough water.3
Second, clover provides excellent animal fodder, which allows for a larger cattle population
and an increased production of milk and butter.

Thus, our evidence proposes that increased agricultural productivity was a positive force
for long run development in an economy that liberalized and became more open. Our evi-
dence also suggests that indeed the introduction of clover is one of the “success stories of
agriculture as the basis for the beginning of the development process” (World Bank 2007).
More broadly, the paper also contributes to the understanding of the degree to which the agri-
cultural revolution that started in the Netherlands and England had an impact on European
economic development.

There are two reasons as to why we interpret the results as supporting the notion that
clover introduction increased per capita incomes. First, market town populations are strongly
related to urbanization rates for years in which data are available. Second, cross-sectional
evidence shows that clover played a role for the establishment of cooperative creameries,
which constituted the dairy sector. Denmark was likely in a Post-Malthusian Regime for

1 Clover was introduced in Northern Europe from the sixteenth century until the early nineteenth century as
a central part of an agricultural revolution (Kjærgaard 1995; Overton 1996). Mokyr (1990) notes that using
the term “revolution” is misleading as the introduction of the new agricultural system was not abrupt. Yet, he
notes that clover was part of a system known as the new husbandry, whose principles he labels “revolutionary”.
Clover is also emphasized by Chorley (1981) for northwest Europe and by Allen (2008) for England.
2 This speaks to recent work by Henderson et al. (2018), who ﬁnd that agglomeration is much more strongly
related to measures of agricultural productivity than measures of openness in locations that developed early,
as compared to late developers.
3 This is often termed the nitrogen hypothesis and clover is said to be a nitrogen-ﬁxing plant because of its
ability to increase the nitrogen supply in the soil; see Allen (2008).

most of the period (Klemp and Møller 2016), and it experienced increased growth at the end
of the nineteenth century as part of its economic take-off.4

For most of the time periods of our analysis (until 1857), the unit of our analysis, the
Danish market towns, had local monopolies on the trade in agricultural goods. We think that
this might explain in part why we observe local effects, but interestingly we note that the
effects persist after the 1857 reform. We further note that Denmark’s decisive move towards
free trade occurred in 1864 when a tariff reform was passed (see Henriksen et al. 2012). Yet,
Hansen (1984) notes that in 1838 tariffs on ﬁnished goods were reduced and the so-called
Sound Toll was abolished in 1857, meaning that the overall economy was becoming more
open.

To identify the effect of clover adoption, we exploit the widespread adoption of this crop
in Denmark as a historical experiment using a differences-in-differences estimation strat-
egy.5 The existence of detailed historical data for Denmark provides a unique opportunity to
investigate the shock to agricultural productivity as caused by the adoption of clover. More-
over, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in alfalfa soil suitability in an instrumental
variables approach to deal with the fact that clover adoption is likely to be endogenous.

Speciﬁcally, we use data from Kjærgaard (1991, 1995) on the areas that had adopted
clover in 1805 as a proxy of soil suitability for growing clover.6 By this year, clover had
spread widely in Denmark. Since these data indicate adoption, reverse causality concerns
naturally arise, as early adoption may be caused by increased demand from the growing
urban populations. To address this, we instrument clover adoption by soil suitability for
growing alfalfa—like clover also a legume—which according to the historical narrative had
its breakthrough after the period studied. Thus, our IV estimates compare areas that adopted
clover due to exogenous soil suitability for growing alfalfa with non-adopters before and
after widespread adoption. The breakthrough of clover in Denmark has been dated to the
early nineteenth century.7

The late breakthrough of alfalfa, combined with Kjærgaard’s data, allow us to investigate
the causal effect of clover on urbanization across Denmark. We show that our results are robust
to adding controls for soil suitability and other potential confounders, excluding the capital
Copenhagen and other large cities, the size of local markets, and alternative functional forms.
Moreover, there are no discernible pre-trends in areas with more suitable soil for growing
alfalfa. We also demonstrate that any direct effect of alfalfa suitability should account for
more than 60 percent of the observed reduced form using the technique of Conley et al.
(2012) to explain the observed effect.

Moreover, we supplement our estimations on town panel data with cross-sectional evi-
dence from the 1838 agricultural census, supplemented with data on cooperative creameries

4 Growth in per capita income increased from 0.9 percent per year on average from 1820 to 1870 to 1.4 percent
per year on average from 1870 to 1901 based on the Maddison data set.
5 Kopsidis and Wolf (2012) produce evidence in line with the view that urbanization drives agricultural
productivity, rather than agriculture shaping urbanization. This would imply that we face the problem of
reverse causation.
6 The adoption of clover spread gradually from 1775 to 1805, according to Kjærgaard (1991, 1995), where
adoption in 1775 was very limited. We also explore this time variation in clover adoption as an alternative
estimation strategy.
7 For several places, Kjærgaard (1991, 1995) provides the following years of adoption: Andalusia (before
1270), Brescia (1550), Flanders (1563), France (1583), England (1620), Mainz (1645), Fehmarn (1710),
Würzburg (1720), Schleswig–Holstein (1725), Berlin (1735), Moravia (1740). For Sweden, Mats Morell
indicated in personal communication that clover had early introductions in Sweden in the early eighteenth
century, but that it was only about 100 years later that it had its breakthrough.

and human capital, to obtain evidence on the channels through which clover affected long
run development.

Our instrumental variables estimation shows a positive effect of clover on urban
populations, whereas OLS estimates are indicative of reverse causality bias. Moreover, the
cross-sectional evidence from the ﬁrst Danish agricultural census in 1838 suggests that clover
increased grain yields, the number of cows, the number of cooperative creameries and the
number of folk high schools, the latter being our measure of human capital. Using mediating
regressions, we ﬁnd suggestive evidence that human capital accumulation was a mediating
factor for the increase in urban populations. We also ﬁnd that our underlying variation in
alfalfa suitability is not related to pea suitability. Therefore, our results cannot be explained
by increased use of peas, which themselves ﬁx nitrogen, although much less efﬁciently than
clover. Finally, we also show that our results are unlikely to be driven by general productivity
increases on soils historically suitable for cereal production.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review of
the previous empirical research. Section 3 provides the historical background and discusses
the advantages and breakthrough of clover in more detail. Section 4 describes the empirical
strategy as well as the data. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 concludes.8

2 Literature review of previous empirical research

2.1 Previous research on the effect of clover

In related research, Allen (2008) carries out simulations that attribute more than 50 percent
of the rise in crop yields in England between 1300 and 1800 to nitrogen-ﬁxing legumes
such as clover, in what is labeled the nitrogen hypothesis. Yet, he does not evaluate the
effect econometrically.9 Some econometric evidence is offered by Allen (1992), who runs
regressions using a data set of 35 Oxfordshire farms and ﬁnds little relationship between the
share of land used for leguminous crops and yields for wheat and barley. Yet, he does not
resolve the endogeneity problem. By contrast, we proceed by testing the effect of clover using
a differences-in-differences approach. This is done by interacting a cross-sectional measure
of soil suitability for growing alfalfa (the ﬁrst difference) with the timing of the widespread
adoption of clover, which took place after 1800 (the second difference).

2.2 Previous empirical research on the impact of agricultural productivity on long

run development

Previous research has investigated the impact of the introduction of the potato (Nunn and
Qian 2011), the introduction of the heavy plow (Andersen et al. 2016), the introduction of
maize (Chen and Kung 2016), the introduction of genetically modiﬁed soy beans (Bustos
et al. 2016), the Green Revolution (Gollin et al. 2016), agricultural reforms in China (Marden
2016) and in Italy (Carillo 2018). Some of this research focus on developments in the past

mentary descriptions of data and results for Danish market towns as well as some results based on Prussian
counties. These are available online.
9 Chorley (1981) provides a calculation suggesting that legumes were important in expanding the nitrogen
supply from 1750 to 1880. Yet, like Allen (2008), he provides no econometric analysis.

and other in the present (see also, Ashraf and Galor (2011) for the effect of agricultural
productivity on development till 1500).

One advantage of our study compared to that of Nunn and Qian (2011) is that the data
that we utilize overcome some of the weaknesses of the well-known Bairoch et al. (1988)
data set as used by Nunn and Qian (2011). First, the Bairoch et al. (1988) data consider only
(1) towns that reached 5000 inhabitants at least once before 1800 and (2) towns for which
the 5000 inhabitants criterion could not be ruled out. As pointed out by Mumford (1974),
focusing only on cities that grow large is equivalent to looking only at adults as human,
and by doing so we will miss out on the variation from smaller places that did not make it
once to the 5000 inhabitants threshold within the period. By focusing on market towns that
had similar rights and possibly grew from levels lower than 5000 inhabitants, we alleviate
this problem. Second, the Danish data also have better coverage over time, as Bairoch et al.
(1988) only cover data every 100 years from 1000 to 1700 and every 50 years from 1700
to 1850.10 Third, the Danish data are census data and do not rely on any interpolation. By
contrast, Bairoch et al. (1988) interpolated data for non-census years.

Moreover, some confounding factors can be ruled out by focusing on the Danish case.
Denmark does (and did) not have coal deposits, and this excludes the possibility that proximity
to coal may confound the results.11 Also, while the potato was introduced in Denmark in the
period studied, which we control for, this was not the case for other new world crops such as
maize.12,13 Further, focusing on Denmark allows us to control for the effect of concurrent
institutional changes, which is difﬁcult in studies that exploit variations in city size across
borders.14 During the period studied, Denmark was subject to serfdom from 1733 to 1800,
and we control for this by including common time effects. The common time effects arguably
also capture other common institutional changes that were taking place in this period.

Like the paper on the heavy plow, we use Danish data, but we observe that Andersen
et al. (2016) lack data on urban populations and contemporary agricultural outputs. In this
way, their analysis is suggestive of an effect of agricultural productivity on development, but
they cannot relate this to the increased grain yields in the historical period (AD 1000–1300).
Moreover, the introduction of clover likely had effects on the development of a modern
dairy sector that used more advanced technology and contributed to long run economic
development. The heavy plow is likely to have worked mainly by raising grain yields.

Chen and Kung (2016) show that the introduction of maize increased the population in
China, but did not, unlike the potato, have an impact on urbanization rates. We cover a

10 The Danish population data includes observations for the years 1672, 1769, 1787, 1801, 1834, 1840, 1845,
1855, 1860, 1870, 1880, 1890, and 1901.
11 Fernihough and O’Rourke (2014) demonstrate a relation between proximity to coal and city growth after
1750. Their maps indicate that the Danish towns in the Bairoch data set were all located far from coal reserves.
We note below that deposits of brown coal were mined on the island of Bornholm. Since we cannot obtain
data on this, we opt to leave out this remote island for this and other reasons.
12 Cook (2014) argues that countries with higher shares of lactase-persistent population (i.e., the share of the
population that can digest milk) beneﬁt more from potatoes. In the Danish case, lactase persistence is almost
100 percent, suggesting that the beneﬁts of potatoes can be enjoyed in full.
13 Many sources argue that maize could not be grown for human food in Denmark due to the growing season
being too short (Madsen-Mygdal 1912; Encyclopedia Denmark). The same source discusses some experiments
with using maize as a fodder crop, but this use was recent and not widespread around 1912 when Madsen-
Mygdal published his handbook. According to FAO soil suitability measures, sweet potatoes cannot be grown
successfully in Denmark although this crop reached Europe very early (Nunn and Qian 2011).
14 Nunn and Qian (2011) also consider the effect of potato introduction on the heights of French soldiers, and
in this setup they control for country-speciﬁc institutions as well as changes to these. We note, however, that
the outcome of these regressions is height and not urban population.

123

longer period, though we note that their study has urbanization rates. Moreover, we consider
a different shock that does not relate to the introduction of new grains but rather impacted
both grain yields and the dairy sector. Carillo (2018) considers the Battle for Grain (BFG)
policy pursued in the 1920s in Italy, which like Chen and Kung (2016), mainly relates
to grain productivity. The BFG included a package of higher yielding wheat, agricultural
education and subsidies for purchasing e.g. tractors. Carillo (2018) exploits the BFG to
investigate the effect of agricultural productivity on structural change using data from the late
nineteenth century to the early twenty-ﬁrst century. He also considers whether the increases
in productivity led to increased human capital, as also done in the present study.

Some modern studies are close to ours. Bustos et al. (2016) investigate the impact of
genetically modiﬁed soy beans using data from Brazil. Gollin et al. (2016) show that the
adoption of high yielding varieties during the “Green Revolution” increased GDP per capita.
Marden (2016) presents evidence from the reform-era in China suggesting that agricultural
productivity drove the non-agricultural sector. While these studies certainly have merit, all
of them study a shorter period than the current study.

3 Historical background

3.1 Advantages of clover

One advantage of introducing clover as a crop is that it serves to increase nitrogen supply
in the soil. According to Cooke (1967: p. 3), nitrogen is in a class of its own, for in most
agriculture its supply governs the yields of crops that have enough water. For the historical
period under consideration, Kjærgaard (1995: p. 4) concludes that the main way to increase
the supply of nitrogen was to increase the cultivation of leguminous crops. In northern Europe,
this was done mainly by introducing clover, which is considerably better at ﬁxing nitrogen
than many other crops, such as peas, which were already grown. Kjærgaard (1991: p. 111)
shows that clover adds about three times as much nitrogen as, for example, peas. Allen (2008:
p. 186) notes that experimental data posit a proportional relationship between crop yields
and nitrogen input.

A second advantage is that clover served as fodder for cattle, whereby milk and butter
production could be increased. Moreover, as pointed out by Mokyr (2009: p. 180), better-fed
animals produce more fertilizer. He also points out that the empirical relationship between
clover and soil fertility was known at the time. This is corroborated by Marshall (1929: p. 46),
who notes that the relationship was known by eighteenth century writers, such as Stephen
Switzer and Robert Maxwell, who posited that clover draws nitrogen from the air and “gives
it to the land.”

Finally, we note that alfalfa has similar advantages but as will be described in Sect. 4,
it did not have its breakthrough in Denmark in the period studied. We return to evaluating
whether and how clover affected speciﬁc measures of agricultural productivity in Sect. 5.5.15

15 Kjærgaard (1995) argues that the prediction made by the founder of the Danish Agricultural Society, P.E.
Lüders, that clover introduction would transform Denmark into a “new Canaan of milk and honey” should be
understood literally. Clover contributed both to increased milk production and increased the biological niche
for the honeybee. We report on a test of this argument in Sect. 5.5.

3.2 The breakthrough of clover

According to Falbe-Hansen (1887: p. 136), it was not until the 1820s and 1830s that clover
was introduced on many farms in Denmark. Kjærgaard (1991, 1995) provides a short histo-
riography of clover in Denmark. Importantly, he provides maps of its geographic diffusion
in 1775, 1785, 1795, and 1805. It should also be noted that Kjærgaard’s maps only indicate
clover adoption and not the intensity. Clover seems to have been grown in a single town in
1732, but Kjærgaard (1995: p. 6) stresses that it was still regarded as a new crop and was only
grown experimentally. His maps suggest that only few places had adopted clover by 1775
(see panel A of Fig. 1) and it was not until 1805 that it had spread to a signiﬁcant proportion of
the country (see panel B of Fig. 1). The map for 1805 shows limited diffusion in the western
part of the country, whereas adoption in the eastern part was much more widespread. These
data indicate a breakthrough around 1805, yet we note that given the data availability for
urban populations, we cannot distinguish 1805 from the 1830s since the population census
years were 1801 and 1834, see Sect. 4.1.

We ﬁnally note that clover would often be introduced on Danish ﬁelds that used a crop
rotation system known as Koppelwirtschaft invented in Holstein (Bjørn 1988: pp. 35–37).
This system required that the cultivated area was divided into at least seven ﬁelds. With,
for example, 11 ﬁelds, the ﬁelds would be used in the following way: (1) fallow, (2) wheat
or rye, (3). barley, (4) rye, (5) barley, (6) oats with clover, (7) clover for hay, (8) clover for
hay and grazing, and (9–11) grazing. As shown by the example, the principal advantages of
clover could be exploited. First, crops were planted along with clover to increase nitrogen in
the soil. Second, clover was used as grazing for cattle. The eleven-ﬁeld system might not be
feasible on smaller farms, and in this case Bjørn (pp. 38–39) notes that ﬁve ﬁelds were used
with grains being planted along with clover.

3.3 Historical narrative for England

Kerridge (1967: pp. 280–288) describes some of the diffusion of clover in England from 1650
onwards, but does not provide evidence of how important it was. As in the case of Denmark,
alfalfa does not seem to have been important initially (p. 288). Overton (1996: p. 110)
observes that clover accounted for about 3 percent of the arable acreage at the beginning of
the eighteenth century and had increased to 30 percent around 1830. He also cites seventeenth
century writers, who had observed that “after the three or four ﬁrst years of clovering, it will
so frame the earth, that it will be very ﬁt to corn again”, which he interprets to mean that
cereals following clover will have higher yields. Overton (p. 117) also states that the Norfolk
four-course system could have been responsible for unprecedented changes in both crop and
livestock productivity and output.16 While nitrogen ﬁxation increased yields, farmers were
more interested in the fodder provided for livestock (p. 121).

Thus, the account of Overton (1996) suggests that both channels mentioned in the intro-
duction were present. In a similar spirit to Chorley (1981), Allen (2008) investigates the
impact on grain yields and shows that the effects would be very slow when legumes, such
as beans and peas, were introduced in the crop rotation. With the Norfolk system, the effects

16 In England, some places adopted a four-course (or Norfolk) rotation which included: (1) wheat, (2) turnips,
(3) barley or oats, and (4) clover. In both Koppelwirtschaft and the four course rotation system, clover played
an important role (Birnie 1962: p. 14). Turnips were not included in Koppelwirtschaft and are only included in
ofﬁcial agricultural statistics from the 1870s in Denmark together with other fodder plants. Moreover, turnips
do not ﬁx nitrogen from the air, whereas clover does (Allen 2008: p. 197). Thus, it is likely that good turnip
yields depend on growing clover, but not the other way around.

are larger because of the nitrogen ﬁxing property of clover, but since it included turnips, this
would tend to reduce its positive effects on grain yields. The full effects also take a long time to
materialize fully, but Allen’s simulation suggests that there would be effects after 30–50 years.

3.4 Early historical clover experiments

While the chemistry of nitrogen ﬁxation was not fully understood in the nineteenth cen-
tury, there was a lively debate about its importance. As noted by Kjærgaard (1995), Justus
Liebig long insisted that nitrogen was not of importance.17 The importance of nitrogen was
maintained by British soil chemists, Lawes and Gilbert, and they were shown to be right.
Historical and modern farming experiments strongly suggest the existence of nitrogen ﬁxa-
tion with effects showing up over varying time periods, though the full effect takes longer
time to materialize as shown in the work by Allen (2008).

The Rothamsted experiments conducted on a farm in England in the historical period
suggests that clover in the rotation increases the yields of wheat relatively quickly, as data were
reported for 8-year periods (Hall 1905: Chapter 10). This suggests that nitrogen ﬁxation also
happens over short time periods. Moreover, in the 1830s, Boussingault provided experimental
evidence that legumes contributed nitrogen to the soil (Aulie 1970). Boussingault made
experiments on ﬁelds in 1838 and found that the soil on which he planted clover had an
increase in nitrogen, whereas the part on which he planted wheat there was none. All the
studies suggest that the effects could very well materialize within 30–50 years.

4 Data and empirical strategy

4.1 Data

Our data include a measure of development, a measure of clover adoption, a measure of
alfalfa soil suitability as well as other measures used in the analysis. We will discuss each in
turn.

Outcome and variables of interest Our measure of development is market town population,
which is a measure of urbanization. There are several reasons as to why higher agricultural
productivity could affect town development.18 First, it is arguably the case that only societies
with a certain level of agricultural productivity can sustain urban centers (Acemoglu et al.
2005).19 Thus, the evolution of urban populations is one of the best proxies for economic
development historically (Acemoglu et al. 2005; Cantoni 2015).

17 Liebig himself developed fertilizers and according to Encyclopedia Britannica, he began to develop “chemi-
cal manures” in 1845 to provide minerals more efﬁciently. Moreover, his fertilizers were shown to be inefﬁcient
and uneconomic” (https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justus-Freiherr-von-Liebig). Also, Brock (2002:
p. 173) labels the fertilizers developed by Liebig a ﬁasco. Christensen (1996: pp. 589–590) describes the ﬁrst
experiments using Liebig’s fertilizer in 1846–1847. The experiments took place in Liverpool and focused on
four types of grain, potatoes, turnips, grasses, legumes, tobacco and ﬂax. Christensen describes the experiments
as a “miserable failure”. Either there were no effects or the effects came at too high costs.
18 Our paper is most directly related to papers studying the impact of agricultural productivity on levels of
development, but we note that recent literature has linked caloric yields to time preference (Galor and Özak
2016) and the observability of agricultural output to state capacity (Hunning and Wahl 2017).
19 See also Glaeser (2014: p. 1154), who argues that “historically, urban growth required enough development
to grow and transport signiﬁcant agricultural surpluses.”

123

Second, higher agricultural productivity may spur rural–urban migration if it serves to
lower the demand for labor in the agricultural sector as stressed by Nunn and Qian (2011).
Third, Gollin et al. (2007) emphasize that agricultural productivity needs to reach some
critical level before resources can be moved into industry, which historically would often be
in towns.

Fourth, in case Malthusian effects are present, larger populations would affect the degree
of specialization, which could increase urban populations. In line with a Malthusian model,
Ashraf and Galor (2011) demonstrate that higher productivity leads to higher population
densities at the national level. While this result could be in line with models of worker
migration, the authors show evidence suggesting that this is not the case. In our setting, we
also use a productivity shock to estimate the impact on populations, though these are urban
populations. One interpretation is that with larger populations overall, this could call for more
division of labor and an increase in urban occupations along Smithian lines (Galor 2011).20
Yet, given that some of the small towns also had agricultural production, part of the response
could be Malthusian. Nevertheless, as the towns were far from self-sufﬁcient, this seems less
likely.21

Evidence by Klemp and Møller (2016) suggests that Denmark was in the Post-Malthusian
regime in the period 1824–1890, which strongly overlaps with our period. This regime is
characterized by the presence of the Malthusian positive link between income and population,
but income is not stagnating as in the Malthusian regime (Galor and Weil 2000). Moreover,
Denmark also had its economic take-off in this period as mentioned in the introduction.
We also ﬁnd similar results when we use only the largest towns and cities in the data set.
Focusing on market towns and their local markets we cannot compute urbanization ratios
since the level of analysis is the town. Even so, when we use data for the whole country
using the subnational unit known as herred (plural: herreder), evidence from the Danish
census for different years shows that the share of the urban population is positively and
signiﬁcantly correlated with market town population. The correlation coefﬁcient between
the share of market town dwellers and log market town populations is 0.78 and signiﬁcant
at the 1 percent level in 1834. In line with the arguments stated above, Jedwab and Vollrath
(2015) show that urbanization and GDP per capita have been positively correlated in the cross-
section across time periods. Still, they also consider cases in which urbanization can occur
without economic growth. We consider an agricultural revolution, which is one of the cases
in which urbanization is believed to be positively associated with economic development
(Jedwab and Vollrath 2015: p. 14).

Market town populations The census data for market town populations were compiled by
“den digitale byport” (the digital town gate).22 The market towns had local monopolies on
carrying out trade, craftsmanship, and other business activities until the Trade Act of 1857

20 The fact that clover was introduced along with ﬁeld systems that reduced the fallow, this could have
increased demand for agricultural workers who would then get higher wages, which could raise fertility and
in this way increase population.
21 For example, Elkjær (2001) stresses that Danish market town dwellers were simultaneously craftsmen,
merchants, and farmers, as they grew crops on the ﬁelds outside their town. She also documents that three
of the market towns in Jutland in the western part of Denmark all had clover and potato production at the
time of the ﬁrst agricultural census of 1838. Yet, they were far from self-sufﬁcient. For the eighteenth century,
Mikkelsen (1993) demonstrates substantial production in the vicinity of market towns on Zealand in the eastern
part of Denmark, but at this point in time neither potato nor clover production is reported.
22 “Den digitale byport” is hosted by the University of Aarhus. The website serves as an information and data
resource for researchers working on Danish town development; see http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/ko

(Christensen and Mikkelsen 2006; Degn 1987). This had been the case since the Market
Town Act of 1422, which meant that trade was transferred to market places and fairs, and
thus peasants were prohibited from selling or buying goods in the countryside. When these
privileges were lost in 1857, it was arguably a common shock to all market towns, and we
therefore do not believe that it poses a threat to identiﬁcation. Yet, effects might be weakened,
as the local effects may depend on the privileges of the market towns.

We use a balanced panel of 56 market towns from 1672 to 1901, which allows us to have
the longest possible pre-period prior to adoption.23 Moreover, we use data on the Kingdom
of Denmark to keep focus on an area with homogeneous institutions. The areas of present-
day Denmark near the German land border were part of duchies that were under the rule
of the Danish king but had their own institutions. Further, these areas were no longer under
Danish rule after the Danish-Prussian war of 1864.24 The population data are available at
irregular time periods. The ﬁrst complete data for market town populations are from 1672 as
originally compiled by Degn (1987). The next data are for 1769 and are taken from the ﬁrst
countrywide census. Census data are further available for the following years: 1787, 1801,
1834, 1840, 1845, 1855, 1860, 1870, 1880, 1890, and 1901. We use all these years in our
estimations. Table A1 in Appendix B gives the population for the 56 towns in 1672 and in
1901. As shown, all the market towns had reached at least 500 inhabitants in 1901, and only
two towns had populations below 1000 inhabitants. This also means that some market towns
had their populations doubled many times in the period studied.

Figure 2 shows the change in the average town population among the 56 towns. There is
a positive change in the average population throughout the period, but the most outspoken
increases seem to take place after 1845.

To construct our measures of clover adoption and alfalfa suitability, we use the fact that the
market towns had local markets. The local markets varied historically from 1 (approximately

23 The focus on a balanced panel, however, comes at the cost of losing observations from the island of
Bornholm. Even so, leaving out the market towns of Bornholm also grants us some beneﬁts. First, Bornholm
is a small, remote island, and we do not wish results to be dependent on special remote island dynamics.
Second, Bornholm never had serfdom as did the rest of the country. Finally, Bornholm has deposits of brown
coal, which was mined during the period studied (Encyclopedia Denmark), and we have no data that allow us
to control for this.
24 This area is known collectively as Southern Jutland (“Sønderjylland”) or North Schleswig (“Nordslesvig”).

7.5 km) to 4 Danish miles. In many cases, the radius of local markets was 2 miles.25 Thus,
we calculate the share of soil adopting clover or suitable for alfalfa in a circle (buffer) with a
15 km radius as a benchmark. The share is calculated from the land mass within this 15 km
circle around each town center. This is what we use to construct, for example, our clover
measure in Eqs. (1) and (2) of Sect. 4.2. We examine the robustness of this choice in the
empirical analysis by choosing different radiuses and construct measures for buffers with a
radius of 5, 10 and 20 km to check for the sensitivity of the distance from a market town.

Clover adoption, 1805 We use Kjærgaard’s map shown in panel B of Fig. 1 for the geographic
distribution of clover adoption in 1805, which was collected on the basis of all “eighteenth
century manor archives and a number of other sources” (Kjærgaard 1995: p. 6).26 Kjærgaard
constructed maps of clover adoption by parish, which is the smallest geographic unit for
Denmark. The extraordinary level of detail of Kjærgaard’s map allows us to make very local
estimates of how much of the area around a market town grew clover. In practice, we calculate
our clover measure from a digitized version of Kjærgaard’s map using the buffers described
above. We measure the extent of clover adoption by using data on the areas that had adopted
this crop by 1805. The underlying parish data are made into a raster ﬁle making it possible to
calculate the share of land with clover adoption within the 15 km buffer with the market town
as the center. According to Fig. 1, clover had not been adopted in many areas prior to 1805.
The 1805 distribution is probably close to an “equilibrium distribution”, and will include
many areas with good suitability for growing clover. Even so, it is likely to be endogenous in
our differences-in-differences setup, and we therefore implement an instrumental variables
strategy based on soil suitability for growing alfalfa, as will be explained next. We also
estimate a model using Kjærgaard’s data for four available periods between 1775 and 1805
to include information on time varying clover adoption. The adoption measure exclusively
indicates the extensive margin of clover adoption, but Kjærgaard (1995) notes that clover
accounted for 30–50 percent in the crop rotation on the island of Funen, which has the most
clover grown according to his maps. We mentioned above that historical examples of crop
rotation also support that clover was in use.

Figure 3 combines market town population in 1672 with the share of clover adoption in
1805. Interpreting the 1805 clover adoption as an “equilibrium distribution”, we see no sign
that this reﬂects effects of pre-trends in the sense of more clover intensive areas having larger
market towns initially in the sample period. In Figure A1 in Appendix B, we impose the
growth rates of town populations for the period 1834–1901 on a similar map to provide an
initial impression of the spatial distribution of development.

Alfalfa suitable soil We use a raster ﬁle from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
Clover and alfalfa both belong to the same family of legumes, and according to the growing
instructions made by Danish supplier “Hunsballe”, both clover and alfalfa grow better on clay
and clayey soils.27 This suggests that suitability for growing alfalfa also captures suitability
for growing clover. The best soils for growing alfalfa have medium suitability, and we use
soils with at least medium suitability to construct our measure of alfalfa suitability.

The alfalfa measure is based on the share of land with at least medium suitability for alfalfa
within a buffer of some radius from each market town of similar size as the one applied to the

25 The market town descriptions in “den digitale byport” question whether this could be enforced.
26 For a more detailed description of the methodological considerations of establishing the maps of clover
adoption in Denmark, see Kjærgaard (1991).
27 Hunsballe is a supplier of clover seeds to the Danish agricultural sector dating back to 1921.

clover measure. These soils are indicated in green in Fig. 4 (see Figures A2–A4 for alternative
maps).

The suitability measure is constructed according to the following procedure as summarized
by Nunn and Qian (2011, pp. 609–610), which holds for any crop. In a ﬁrst step, for each
cell FAO identiﬁed the days of the year when the moisture and thermal requirements of the
crop are met. Using this information, FAO determined the exact starting and ending dates of
the length of the growing period for each grid cell. This allows FAO to determine whether
the cell is suitable for growing the crop. In a second step, constraint-free crop yields were
determined, and the yield in each grid-cell was measured as a percentage of this benchmark.
Finally, additional constraints that exist in each cell were identiﬁed. In the end, the procedure
determines the percentage of maximum obtainable yield of each of the cells. This leads to
a classiﬁcation. Cells with attainable yields of 80 percent or above the maximum potential
yield are classiﬁed as “Very Suitable”. Cells that attain 60–80 percent of maximum yields are
classiﬁed as “Suitable”, “Medium Suitable”: 40–60 percent, “Marginally Suitable”: 20–40
percent. We use the data under the assumption of rain fed agriculture and low input level.
The spatial resolution of the underlying raster ﬁle is 0.5× 0.5 degrees.

Given that alfalfa and clover require similar soils, it is plausible that soils with medium or
better suitability for growing alfalfa are the more suitable for growing clover. This is backed
up by three pieces of evidence. First, we ﬁnd a strong relationship when we use instrumental
variables estimation in the differences-in-differences setup reported in Sect. 5. Second, when
we correlate the share around a town or in a herred that grew clover in 1805 with the share
of medium suitable soil for growing alfalfa, we ﬁnd strong and signiﬁcant correlations. The

simple correlation coefﬁcients are 0.53 and 0.44 for the town panel and the herred cross-
section respectively. Comparing the maps does reveal that there are areas adopting clover
without much alfalfa suitable soil, yet we are ultimately exploiting conditional relationships,
and to illustrate those, we show partial plots for the ﬁrst stage regressions in Figure A5 for both
the town panel and the cross-sectional herred data. While the relationships are not perfect,
they are positive and strongly signiﬁcant. We also note that we can use different buffer zones,
and still obtain similar results. Finally, we point to evidence from the 1886 agricultural census
of Prussia, which shared a border with the Kingdom of Denmark, available from the Prussian
Economic History Database (Becker et al. 2014). Prussian farmers grew alfalfa perhaps due
to better climatic conditions, and in fact yields for clover and alfalfa are strongly correlated;
see Table A2 and Figures A6 and A7 in Appendix B. Therefore, the relevance criterion for
our proposed instrument is plausibly satisﬁed.28

Alfalfa may have been grown in small amounts over the period considered, but as stressed
by Kjærgaard (1995) clover was the legume par excellence in Denmark. Kjærgaard (1991:
p. 71) notes that alfalfa was not widely adopted for climatic reasons. As mentioned in footnote
28, alfalfa may have been less productive in coastal climates and for this reason, clover might
have been preferred by Danish farmers.

28 In line with this, Madsen-Mygdal (1912) emphasizes that countries with a continental climate, rather
than a coastal climate, may obtain higher yields of alfalfa. Moreover, none of the present-day Danish towns
of Aabenraa, Sønderborg, Tønder, or Haderslev—which in 1886 were part of Germany—grew any alfalfa,
though they did grow clover. Data on alfalfa are also absent from the agricultural censuses for Denmark for
the nineteenth century.

123

Journal of Economic Growth (2018) 23:387–426

401

Brøndegaard (1978–1980) also stresses the importance of clover and that alfalfa was not
widely adopted in the nineteenth century. We compared the articles on the two crops in his
encyclopedia “Folk and Flora.” There it is stated that in 1805, the introduction of clover
had led to improved productivity and was the foremost improvement to agriculture at the
time. Moreover, it is observed in line with the empirical evidence that clover is thriving
on clayey soils. It is said not to deplete the soil and wheat yields improve after the use of
clover. Furthermore, red clover is recognized as a valuable fodder crop (p. 217). The same
text mentions examples of attempts with the use of alfalfa as a fodder crop, but it did not
have its breakthrough until after 1900, and it is speculated that alfalfa did not ﬁt well into the
crop rotation of the time. This is also corroborated by handbooks on agriculture edited by
Madsen-Mygdal (1912, 1938). Madsen-Mygdal (1912: p. 452) explains that Danish farmers
had made many unsuccessful attempts at growing alfalfa, and therefore they viewed the crop
as too uncertain. He concludes that many farmers believed that alfalfa was unlikely to ever
gain importance for this reason. In the 1938 version of the same handbook, he reiterates
that many farmers held the view that alfalfa was too uncertain under Danish conditions
(Madsen-Mygdal 1938). This suggests that since alfalfa was not widely adopted in the period
studied, the suitability for growing alfalfa did not affect market town populations directly
through alfalfa adoption.29 If the main channel through which alfalfa suitability could have
direct effects is actual adoption, local alfalfa soil suitability plausibly satisﬁes the exclusion
restriction.

4.2 Empirical strategy

We approach our investigation by estimating models that build on the logic of differences-in-
differences estimation. We also investigate the cross-sectional effects of clover on measures
of agricultural productivity and human capital so as to provide evidence on channels through
which clover affects town population, but we postpone the discussion of this to Sect. 5.5.

As mentioned, we rely on differences-in-differences estimation. In practice, we construct
interactions between clover adoption or alfalfa suitability varying within the cross-section
of towns with a time dummy which is one after the breakthrough of clover as of 1834.
We estimate a differences-in-differences model for urban populations using the interaction
of clover adoption with a dummy equal to one from 1834 onwards as the right-hand-side
variable. We begin by estimating the following speciﬁcation for the natural logarithm of the
populations (ln pop) of town i at time t:

29 Madsen-Mygdal (1912) speculates that alfalfa could be grown with success in some areas of Denmark as
also indicated by Fig. 4. His discussion suggests that this is due to the climate, but he explains that the likely
reason why growing alfalfa had failed was likely that farmers had not respected the requirements for growing
alfalfa. He also mentions that some of these requirements had only recently become known.

represents market town dummies (i.e., time and town ﬁxed effects). cloveri ,1805 is

The potential bias of the differences-in-differences estimator can best be understood
by considering the simple two period version (Wooldridge 2002). For our case, this is
(urbanclover
), where the superscript clover
indicates clover adoption in 1805. It is, for example, possible that places that had adopted
clover by 1805, had large urban populations prior to 1805 and that clover mainly helped to
sustain the larger urban populations. This would tend to introduce a negative bias from such
pre-trends as the ﬁrst term would be small. Alternatively, if there is a positive differential
trend in the urban population in clover adopting towns, we would obtain a positive bias. We
accordingly estimate versions of the models where we instrument cloveri ,1805 by al f al f ai ,
which similarly denote the share of soil suitable land around the market town for grow-
ing another legume, namely alfalfa. As we noted above, obtaining better alfalfa and clover
yields requires similar soil conditions thereby arguably fulﬁlling the relevance criterion for
an instrument.

The alfalfa suitability measure is plausibly exogenous since the historical record shows
that alfalfa had its breakthrough in Denmark long after the period studied, for which
reason we use it as an instrument for cloveri ,1805. To be more precise, we instrument
. Alfalfa suitability is also required to
ln
have no direct effects on urban populations to fulﬁll the exclusion restriction. This could
fail if, for example, alfalfa was widely adopted in the surrounding areas of market towns.
Yet, as we have explained alfalfa was not widely adopted in the period making this unlikely.
Moreover, we control for the soil suitability for other crops, such as potatoes and barley, and
other potential confounders in some speciﬁcation so as to add credibility to the exclusion
restriction.

We also estimate ﬂexible speciﬁcations for the reduced form for alfalfa suitability (and

clover adoption) which allows for separate coefﬁcients for different points of time (t):

This model allows us to evaluate when this plausibly exogenous soil suitability as an indicator
of the effect of clover began having an effect on urban populations. In other words, this allows
for a test of whether our assumption about the breakthrough of clover after 1801, based on
the historical narrative, is plausible.

We include town and period ﬁxed effects to avoid confounding the effects of our variables
of interest with town-speciﬁc and time-speciﬁc common factors.31 Town ﬁxed effects will
capture spatial heterogeneity in terms of direct ﬁxed time-invariant effects of, for instance,

30 We use a radius of 15 km from the center of the market town as the benchmark and calculate the share of
land adopting clover within this circle/buffer. However, we consider the sensitivity of changes to the radius of
the buffer as discussed in Sect. 3.1.
31 Most of the market towns have easy access to the sea. In fact, 50 out of 56 towns have direct access to the
sea or rivers. In general, variation in distance to sea or rivers is limited for the Danish market towns, and we
therefore do not control for a time-varying effect of this. Yet, we note that the town ﬁxed effects capture direct
access to the sea, and any direct effect thereof. Still, we control for openings of ports in some speciﬁcations,
and this does not change the results.

123

403

soil quality and location. In contrast, our focus is on time-varying effects that arise due to the
interaction between soil quality and the breakthrough of clover in a differences-in-differences
setup.

We include time ﬁxed effects as we are interested in the differential impact of clover on
development such that any effect we estimate is relative to a common shock and aggregate
changes. Controlling for common shocks is also important since the period studied was a
time of institutional changes at the country level. For example, eighteenth century Denmark
had serfdom, which tied rural workers to the countryside, and this may have hampered town
development (e.g., Christensen 1945). Serfdom was a common shock to the whole country,
and it is accordingly important to control for it.

We also control for potato suitability using data from the FAO as the potato was adopted
in the same period as clover (Falbe-Hansen 1887). Most soils of Denmark have at least a
medium suitability for growing potatoes, and we therefore use the share of land with good
suitability or higher within a buffer following Andersen et al. (2016).32 In some speciﬁcations,
we also control for time by ﬁxed effects for the regions that did not have serfdom throughout
the period to capture differences in institutional trajectories. If all soils suitable for growing,
for instance, plow positive crops, such as barley, in general were experiencing productivity
changes,33 alfalfa suitability would not be uncorrelated with the error term. Therefore, we
control for other measures of agricultural productivity, such as overall yields and (historical)
barley yields or (modern) barley suitability, in some speciﬁcations. We will return to this
below in Sect. 5.3, where we also apply the technique of Conley et al. (2012) to investigate
the exclusion restriction. It is also possible that we capture other nitrogen ﬁxing crops such
as peas. We will investigate this in Sect. 5.5.

5 Results

5.1 Results from the non-flexible models

The results for the non-ﬂexible model are shown in Table 1 based on a benchmark case of
clover adopting land shares within a 15 km radius or buffer. As our baseline, we report standard
errors corrected for town-speciﬁc clustering. In Table A4 in Appendix B, we demonstrate
that results are robust to using Conley t-statistics for which standard errors are corrected for
spatial correlation in the error term. These Conley t-statistics allow for direct dependence
between towns that are within 2 degrees, or roughly 222 km, of each other. We ﬁnd that
results are in general stronger with this type of standard error and therefore regard clustering
corrected standard errors as the more conservative benchmark.34

The ﬁrst part of Table 1 presents the basic (partial) correlations. In column (1), in which we
control for ﬁxed effects for towns and years, we ﬁnd a negative and insigniﬁcant coefﬁcient

32 When we correlate the share of a herred that has good soil suitability for growing potatoes with potato
yields from the ﬁrst agricultural census, we ﬁnd a positive association, which is statistically signiﬁcant at the
10 percent level.
33 The plow is more beneﬁcial for crops that require large tracts of land to be prepared in a short period of
time, and that can be grown only in soils that are not shallow, not sloped, and not rocky (Pryor 1985). Barley
is an example of such a crop, which is denoted plow positive.
34 In Table A5 in Appendix B, we show how the results depend on the extent of spatial dependence we allow
for. With very low spatial dependence, the signiﬁcance is in general reduced for alfalfa but increases as we
allow for more spatial dependence. In a small country like Denmark, higher levels of spatial dependence are
arguably more realistic.

for clover. Once we add controls for the potato as in column (2), the sign changes and the
coefﬁcient is signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level. In column (3), we add ﬁxed year effects
speciﬁc for the areas of Funen and Jutland to capture institutional heterogeneity. While all
the country had serfdom (known as “stavnsbaand”) from 1733 to 1800, the eastern islands
of Zealand, Falster, Lolland, and Møn had a version of serfdom known as “vornedskab”
until 1701. Therefore, the eastern islands had serfdom in all observed periods, whereas this
is not true for the western part of the Kingdom on Funen and in Jutland. The effect of this
on the estimated coefﬁcient is that it reduces the point estimate and makes the coefﬁcient
insigniﬁcant.

Once we run the same models with the alfalfa measure in columns (4)–(6), we obtain
signiﬁcance at the 10 percent level or better. As we will discuss in Sect. 5.3, the ﬂexible
estimations for clover adoption and the results of columns (1)–(3) in Table 1 are consistent
with the presence of reverse causality in which those places that had large urban populations
in the beginning of the period also exhibited higher pressure for adopting clover in the
differences-in-differences estimation setup. The ﬂexible estimations in Sect. 5.3 show that
urban populations were large prior to the breakthrough of clover in the towns surrounded by
areas that adopted clover and that any effect after adoption will be more difﬁcult to measure.
For the ﬂexible models with the alfalfa measure, we do not ﬁnd any indications of such
pre-trends.

Next, we turn to the instrumental variables estimates. As we argued above, alfalfa did not
have its breakthrough in Denmark until the twentieth century due to climatic conditions as
well as insufﬁcient knowledge about growing methods. Yet, suitability for growing clover
and suitability for growing alfalfa are likely to be linked since these crops tend to grow on
similar types of soils and belong to the same group of crops.

Columns (7) and (8) in Table 1 report the instrumental variables estimates for the effects of
clover adoption instrumented with alfalfa suitability on market town population. First stage
results are reported in columns (1) and (2) in Table A6 in Appendix B. We begin by noting
that the F-statistics are large. The value is about 28 for the models in columns (7) and (8). This
is larger than the usual rule of thumb of 10 suggesting that the instrument is strong.35 The
instrumental variables estimates in columns (7) and (8) show that these are larger than the
OLS counterparts in columns (1) and (2). Moreover, they are signiﬁcant at the 5 percent level,
whereas the OLS estimates are smaller and insigniﬁcant when we control for Funen/Jutland
speciﬁc year effects. This suggests that the instrumental variables estimates effectively deal
with the reverse causality mentioned above. Investigating the extent to which the exclusion
restriction is violated, the approach based on Conley et al. (2012) further strengthens that we
are in fact dealing effectively with reverse causality and omitted factors; see Sect. 5.3.

We use the instrumental variables model in column (7) to calculate the counterfactual
contribution from clover to market town population growth from 1672 to 1901 (i.e., we use
the estimated model to remove the effects of clover in 1901). These calculations suggest that
clover can account for 7.7 percent of the increase in town populations from 1672 to 1901.
This effect is modest, yet not trivial.36

Altogether, these results lend support to what Allen (2009) refers to as the standard or
established model in which agricultural productivity drives urban populations. He argues

35 The F statistic for weak identiﬁcation is the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F statistic, as inference is based on
clustering corrected standard errors.
36 We calculate the total growth rate as log population in 1901 minus log population in 1672. To con-
struct the counterfactual, we construct log population in 1901—βclover ln
, which produces
the counterfactual population in 1901. We then calculate the counterfactual population growth, which was
approximately 92.3 percent of the total growth.

for the case of England that causation in the opposite direction was more important. He
emphasizes the role of the expansion of London and it is possible that the capital of Den-
mark, Copenhagen, played a similar role. If this is the case, dropping Copenhagen should
make a large difference to the result. Yet, results are essentially unchanged when dropping
Copenhagen, as shown in Table A7 in Appendix B; see also Sect. 5.4.

5.2 Additional control variables and alternative measures

As we discussed above, one concern is that the alfalfa instrument may pick up other factors.
For example, an increase in agricultural productivity in growing plow positive crops such as
barley. We address this issue in Table 2 in which we add many other control variables than just
the one for potatoes interacted with a dummy equal to 1 from 1834 and 0 otherwise. We use
the potato interaction as our baseline, but also investigate what happens when we interact the
other control variables with a dummy equal to one from 1834. In terms of variables measuring
agricultural productivity, we add caloric yields after 1500 as calculated by Galor and Özak
(2016), a historical measure of barley suitability taken from Andersen et al. (2016),37 and an
indicator for whether an area was using a grass ﬁeld system in 1682 taken from Jensen et al.
(2018).

The caloric yield measure proxies for agricultural productivity of all crops and the barley
measure proxies for a cereal that is known to be plow positive. The grass ﬁeld measure is
included as clover was regarded to be a grass substitute (Overton 1985; Jensen 1998). We
have added population in 1672, which could capture historical agricultural productivity, but
also serves to control for potential convergence. The latter part of the nineteenth century was
a period of railway expansion, and to counter the possibility that we are capturing this, we
control for the roll-out of railways.38

Columns (1), (3), and (5) in Table 2 present our baseline results, and in columns (2), (4),
and (6), we show the effect of adding control variables. We notice that none of the agricultural
productivity variables are signiﬁcant in the population equation. Moreover, the coefﬁcient
on clover is signiﬁcant at the 5 percent level in both the OLS and IV estimations. The same
is true for the alfalfa measure in the reduced form. The estimated effect and signiﬁcance
increase when we add these measures suggesting that controlling for more variables, perhaps
surprisingly, adds more precision. We therefore conclude that the alfalfa instrument does not
capture general productivity increases on soils with high caloric yields, soils that are suitable
for growing cereals or soils that were used for growing grass—the main competitor to clover.
In Sects. 5.3 and 5.5, using ﬂexible speciﬁcations and cross-section evidence, we further
investigate this. Adding the suitability measures also rules out that we are simply capturing
the fact that towns were established in locations where agricultural productivity for existing
crops was naturally high.

We have also estimated a version of the model in which we control ﬂexibly for all the

variables, and we ﬁnd that the result is almost identical; see column (1) of Table 3.

As an alternative way of testing the relation between clover adoption and market town
populations, we exploit Kjærgaard’s maps and construct the adoption measure for each of the

37 The measure is based on peasant payments in terms of barley from the seventeenth century, see also
Appendix A. In Table A8 in Appendix B, we show that results are similar when we use a measure based on
modern data by the FAO. Still, this measure is less likely to capture historical conditions to the same degree
as the historical measure.
38 In Table A9 in Appendix B, we show how clover adoption and alfalfa suitability correlate with these
variables.

years 1775, 1785, 1795, and 1805 and run a new model based on the OLS estimator allow-
ing for possible effects of pre-trends in the differences-in-differences setup. Time dummies
are interacted with the clover adoption measure for the closest year for which we have an
observable market town population. The results are shown in columns (2) and (3) of Table 3.
We observe that the coefﬁcients on the 1775, 1785, and 1795 clover measure interacted with
the dummy for the corresponding years are insigniﬁcant. For years from 1834 onwards (i.e.,
after 1805), the coefﬁcient is larger than for other years and signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level.
We notice that the t-value increases from 0.20 to 1.74 between 1769 and 1834. If we add the
grass ﬁeld variable, we get a similar result, but the signiﬁcance increases; see column (3). The
fact that coefﬁcients in earlier periods are insigniﬁcant suggests an absence of discernible
pre-trends prior to the breakthrough of clover. Yet, it should be noted that the coefﬁcient for
1769 is large and that the coefﬁcients then decrease in subsequent years. This could indicate,
if anything, a negative pre-existing trend, which in general would work against us.

The rest of Table 3 investigates whether our deﬁnition of local markets matters for the
results focusing on alfalfa. Columns (4) and (5) show that calculating shares of land suitable
for alfalfa for smaller radiuses of 5 or 10 km tends to reduce the size of the effect marginally,
although the precision is also reduced. With 5 km buffers, the estimate is not signiﬁcant at
conventional levels. Still, we notice that 5 km is very conservative and that the signiﬁcance is
not far from achieving the 10 percent level. Column (7) demonstrates that effects get larger
with a 20 km buffer, though the precision is similar to the benchmark of 15 km. We conclude
that results are not driven by the choice of the local market size. We show in Table A10 in
Appendix B that the same holds true for the instrumental variables estimates.

5.3 Flexible estimations and alternative explanations

In this section, we present the results from ﬂexible models as speciﬁed by Eq. (2). We
also use the ﬂexible models to investigate whether our results simply capture some general
development associated with clay soils or initial population density, which would affect the
interpretation as well as the plausibility of the exclusion restriction for alfalfa suitability. To
further investigate the plausibility of the exclusion restriction, we use the technique developed
by Conley et al. (2012).

Figure 5 shows the point estimates (along with 90 percent conﬁdence intervals) from
estimating ﬂexible models for market town population with the alfalfa measure interacted
with time dummies of the observable years, respectively. To supplement the ﬁgure, Table 4
reports the results in the ﬁrst row, which shows point estimates as well as t-statistics.

When we use the alfalfa measure, which is plausibly exogenous since the historical record
shows that alfalfa had its breakthrough in Denmark long after the period studied, we observe
systematic signiﬁcance from 1834 onwards. This is largely in line with the historical narrative
on the breakthrough of clover with alfalfa and clover being grown on similar exogenously
given clay soils. The coefﬁcient on the alfalfa measure increases during the period 1787–1901
(with a small dip in 1880).39 Relating to the potential biases of the differences-in-differences
estimator presented in Sect. 5.3, we do not observe any discernible pre-trends prior to 1834,
as the coefﬁcients are insigniﬁcant and the pattern is a decrease in the coefﬁcient from 1769
to 1787 followed by a small increase to 1801. The coefﬁcient for 1769 is relatively large but
insigniﬁcant at conventional levels. Even so, a coefﬁcient of this size may lead us to suspect
a positive pre-existing trend. If this was the case, we would expect the coefﬁcients for 1787

39 Table A11 in Appendix B presents the corresponding ﬂexible estimates for alfalfa and clover for different
buffer sizes.

Fig. 5 The ﬂexible estimations for alfalfa. Notes: The ﬁgure shows years on the ﬁrst axis and the ﬂexibly
estimated coefﬁcients on alfalfa on the second axis. The model controls for ﬁxed effects for town and year as
well as for the potato ﬂexibly. Buffer size is 15 km. The vertical line indicates 1801, which is the last year of
our pre-period. Source: FAO raster data and own calculations

and 1801 to be larger than the 1769 coefﬁcient. In fact, they are smaller and not statistically
distinguishable from the 1672 level. Given that there is a decrease in the coefﬁcients, there
may be a negative pre-existing trend. If that was indeed the case, it would work against us. To
highlight that the coefﬁcients tend to decrease from 1769 to 1801, we show in Figure A8 in
Appendix B the coefﬁcients for the pre-period and impose a linear trend for the coefﬁcients.
Moreover, in Figures A9 and A10, we control for the population levels in 1672 and 1769,
which makes the imposed trend for the pre-period ﬂatter. As shown in row 1 of Table 4,
urban populations are signiﬁcantly larger from 1834 on soils with higher alfalfa suitability.
We also note that while the coefﬁcients of ﬂexible alfalfa from the 1880s onwards are like
those in other years in Table 4, they are insigniﬁcant. This could be because these years are
less comparable with 1801 and before. Yet, we note that all three estimates are close to being
signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level.

In contrast, when we use clover in row 2 of Table 4, the coefﬁcients for 1769, 1787,
and 1801 all exhibit signiﬁcance, for which reason we suspect endogeneity bias. The early
effects of clover can plausibly be related to reverse causality, as the clover measure used
represents the 1805 clover distribution. This may suggest that the areas adopting clover had
higher urban population pressure prior to adoption and pre-trends are important. The effects
in the ﬁnal years are more difﬁcult to explain, but they might suggest that population pressure
took off in the adopting areas. The pattern of coefﬁcients for clover is consistent with the
smaller effects, we ﬁnd in Table 1 and the direction of the bias discussed in Sect. 3. The
relative change between the pre- and post-period is modest suggesting that a differences-in-
differences estimation would yield small effects. Still, as clover adoption is endogenous, the
alfalfa measure is the one that is more likely to capture the causal effect.

Yet, there may be alternative explanations of the pattern observed for alfalfa. These will

be investigated next.

Clay soils and initial productivity While our use of alfalfa suitability measures as sources
of exogenous variation with controls for historical barley suitability go some way towards
establishing that the results represent a causal effect, concerns may remain. For example, we
noted above that alfalfa and clover both tend to grow better on clay soils. Thus, a concern
would be that we capture the effect of other variables that make clay soils more productive.

Fig. 6 Clay soils, alfalfa suitability and initial population. Notes: The ﬁgure shows years on the ﬁrst axis and the
ﬂexible estimates on the second axis. The lines show the coefﬁcients on the alfalfa, clay and 1672 population
variables estimated for each year available. The model controls for ﬁxed effects for town and year as well
as the potato ﬂexibly. Buffer size is 15 km for measures of alfalfa, clover, barley, and clay. The vertical line
indicates 1801, which is the last year of our pre-period. Sources: Alfalfa soil and clay soil are obtained from
FAO raster data and town population in 1672 is obtained from “den digitale byport” (the digital town gate)
and own calculations

Mokyr (1990: p. 59) notes that new plows with a curved mouldboard were introduced in
the Netherlands in the seventeenth century. The new plows had iron mouldboards, as wood is
difﬁcult to shape into the desired form. They also tended not to have wheels, and fewer draft
animals were needed. Further, the Rotherham plow or swing plow with an iron mouldboard
was patented in England in 1730. It was ﬁrst introduced in Denmark in 1770, though its
general diffusion was slow. According to Falbe-Hansen (1887: pp. 137–138), the swing plow
replaced the old wheel plow with a wooden mouldboard gradually over time but also led to
improvements of the old wheel plow. He notes that in 1820, there were 10 wheeled plows
for every swing plow. Kjærgaard (1991: p. 111) argues that the diffusion was faster and that
plows with iron mouldboards were used on no less than two-thirds of Danish farms at the
end of the eighteenth century.

As noted by Christensen (1996: p. 640), contemporaries stressed that the functions of
the plow were to turn the soil—which incorporates, for example, animal manure into the
soil—and to cut the roots of weeds. Both the older heavy plows and the swing plows could
carry out these functions. They were arguably more important on clay soils, where turning
the soil was important for effective weed control because these soils offer more resistance
than lighter soils (Andersen et al. 2016). This suggests that the clay soils may have become
more productive because of new plows as well as the cultivation of clover. We address this
concern by running a regression for market town population on the alfalfa variable and the
share of clay soil interacted with time dummies reported in Fig. 6 and Table 4. If our reduced
form (non-ﬂexible) results for alfalfa are simply capturing that the clay soils become more
productive for a variety of reasons, we should expect to obtain a similar pattern as for alfalfa.
In fact, the patterns of the coefﬁcients of clay soils and alfalfa soils in Fig. 6 are markedly
different.

The results in Table 4 using the share of clay soil suggest that it is unlikely that the
results are driven by a general productivity effect of new plows on clay soils. While the
coefﬁcients for clay soils are positive and rising in some years until 1860, they actually
decrease dramatically from this period onward. Moreover, the t-statistics reported in Table 4
are never signiﬁcant at any conventional level. This suggests that, if anything, it was the

123

415

clay soils that were suitable for legumes that got more productive. This is also reﬂected in
Fig. 6, which plots the estimated coefﬁcients for clay soils and alfalfa (interacted with time
dummies). Andersen et al. (2016) provide evidence that the older heavy plow was important
for urbanization in clay soil areas in Denmark and Europe in general. Our results suggest that
the new plows of the eighteenth century were perhaps not as big improvements as believed by
some contemporaries. In fact, plowing contests carried out from 1770 to 1820 also suggest
that heavy plows could still compete with swing plows. For example, this was the case in
the 1803 tests carried out by the Danish veterinary school (Christensen 1996: p. 632). We
have also added a control for barley suitability in the instrumental variables models above
[see column (6) in Table 2]. As pointed out above, barley is a plow positive crop and for this
reason, and since the clay soils do not exhibit any signiﬁcant relationship with population,
we do not believe that our results are explained by the adoption of new plows.

Finally, as an alternative test of general productivity increases, we consider the initial
population in 1672, which would capture historical agricultural productivity. Yet, we see that
when we estimate the impact of the measure ﬂexibly interacting the population in 1672 with
time dummies, we fail to ﬁnd a pattern like the one for alfalfa in the ﬁrst row of Table 4 and
as shown in Fig. 6.

Violation of exclusion restriction Figure A11 in Appendix B presents estimates of the effect
of clover adoption on town populations using the modiﬁed Instrumental-Variable approach
of Conley et al. (2012). We apply the union of conﬁdence interval (UCI) approach to evaluate
the direct effect of alfalfa suitability, which we denote by γ, on town populations imposing
that the support of the direct effect, γ, is [0, δ], with δ > 0. Thus, we impose the restriction that
the direct effect is positive, which is needed to explain the estimated effect of clover adoption.
We apply the UCI approach since Conley et al. (2012: p. 260) state that “the interval estimates
across different γ provide a conservative (in terms of coverage) interval estimate for β”. For
our case the coefﬁcient of interest is βclover .

Figure A11 shows that our estimate of βclover becomes insigniﬁcant at the 10 percent
level, when the direct effect equals 0.128. Thus, the violation of the exclusion restriction
(the direct effect of the alfalfa suitability on town population) needs to be about 62 percent
(0.128/0.205) of the overall reduced form effect to render our IV results insigniﬁcant [see
column (4) in Table 1]. Given that the direct effect of alfalfa suitability should come from
either alfalfa adoption or other soil types (which themselves have little explanatory power),
we believe that it is perhaps possible, but not plausible, that our results are produced by a
violation of the exclusion restriction.

Trade The period from around 1830 to the late 1870s is in general known as the grain sales
period (Olsen 1961). Skrubbeltrang (1934–1935) provides data showing that grain exports,
were much larger than imports and were on the rise at least from the 1830s. Thus, Denmark
was a net exporter of grains. Hansen (1984: p. 104) shows that about 60 percent of grain
exports went to Norway and England from the 1820s. In the 1840s, 40 percent went to
England. Given this, one might suspect that trade is a driving force in our results. Still, while
grain exports were on the rise, this is also true for our post-period. Hansen (1984: pp. 68–69)
shows that both grain prices and sales were increasing until 1807. The coefﬁcients on alfalfa
are lower in both 1787 and 1801 than in 1769, so it seems unlikely that trade explains our
results.

From the 1880s, exports were shifting towards animal products (Jensen et al. 2018), and
if our results are driven by increased grain yields due to nitrogen ﬁxation, this may explain

123

416

Journal of Economic Growth (2018) 23:387–426

the reduced signiﬁcance as of 1880 in row 1 of Table 4. The loss of privilege of the market
towns in 1857 is a likely factor, though it is puzzling that this works with a 20-year lag.
Another possibility is the 1864 move towards free trade (Henriksen et al. 2012), which may
have affected grain producers adversely, but again the effect comes with a long time lag.
1864 also marks the loss of Schleswig–Holstein and the loss of Hamburg as the main port
for shipping to England.

Henriksen et al. (2012) maintain that the shift to dairying happened gradually, yet its
dominance in agricultural production was established at the end of our study period. More-
over, we ﬁnd below that clover adoption affected the number of cattle locally already by the
late 1830s, when we do observe effects.

To test more directly for the impact of trade as a confounder, we have included railway
access in Table 2, and ﬁnd that this variable had the expected impact, yet it does not change
our result. There are also a few towns that built new ports in the period and when we control
for these, our main result remains unchanged, see Table A12 in Appendix B.

5.4 Additional robustness checks

While our results suggest a causal impact of clover on local town development, a number of
questions remain. For example, we investigate the extent to which the relationship is driven
by larger cities. We have already noted that dropping Copenhagen does not drive results, but
to investigate this further, we exclude the three largest cities in modern times in Table A13
and while precision is reduced, the estimated coefﬁcients are similar.40 We ﬁnally look at
what happens when we only use the cities in Bairoch et al. (1988) and ﬁnd that the coefﬁcients
are much larger than for our baseline. This could indicate that effects depend on population
levels, but could also point to a selection effect.41 Since, we have shown that controlling for
initial population is not signiﬁcant in Table 2, we do not believe the results are mainly driven
by a few large cities.

We next consider the degree to which the effect persists into the twentieth century and
in Table A14 in Appendix B extend the sample to 1925. While the effect is less precisely
estimated, the coefﬁcient is still positive and signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level. Even so, we
note that ﬂexible estimates suggest that the effect is insigniﬁcant for the years in the 1900s;
see Figure A12 in Appendix B. Also, when we look at the period after 1901, the coefﬁcient
is positive but very insigniﬁcant. This suggests that the effect was slowly dying out in the
ﬁrst quarter of the twentieth century.

We have further checked that results do not depend on the choice of the coding of the
variable. For example, we have examined whether we can estimate the models without log
transforming clover; see Table A15. We have also tried to replace clover adoption by dummy
variables as reported in Table A16. First, we have used a pure dummy measure of having
any medium suitable soil for growing alfalfa. When we do so, we obtain similar results, but
the signiﬁcance is reduced to the 10 percent level. When we consider areas that have a share
of least 25 percent suitable soil in the buffer, we ﬁnd stronger results and the signiﬁcance
increases. Even so, we prefer to use the share measure, which is continuous between 0 and
1, and it is what is normally used in the literature.

40 We note that Odense and Aarhus were only the fourth and ﬁfth largest cities historically.
41 When we use the 10 largest towns/cities, clover explains about 18 percent of urban growth from 1672 to
1901. Nunn and Qian (2011) found that the number was about 34 percent for the potato.

123

Journal of Economic Growth (2018) 23:387–426

417

In Table A17, we replace the caloric yield measure by the measure of overall suitability

from Zabel et al. (2014) and ﬁnd our main conclusion to be unchanged.42

We have also implemented a dynamic panel model of the type:

(3)
By using this model, we can control for potential convergence in an alternative way to using
initial population times year dummies. Yet, to be able to interpret the lags properly, we need to
restrict our attention to observations for which we have relatively similar distances between
observations. This leads us to focus on a model with (approximate) 30-year lags and we use
data for 1769, 1801, 1834, 1860, and 1890. We also note that this is a dynamic panel model,
which is difﬁcult to estimate consistently.

In Table A18, we present three different models estimated by OLS and IV, respectively.
The ﬁrst three columns are estimated by OLS without a lagged dependent variable in column
(1), with a lagged dependent variable but without town ﬁxed effects in column (2), and with
a lagged dependent variables and town ﬁxed effects in column (3). The ﬁnal three columns
show the corresponding IV estimates. As in our other results, the IV estimates are all positive
and signiﬁcant. The full model in column (6) suggests that there is convergence in town
populations. Yet, there is a positive effect of clover. It is well-known that Nickell bias may
be an issue with this type of model. Fortunately, Angrist and Pischke (2009) show that the
models in columns (4) and (5) bound the effect of clover. As both are positive and signiﬁcant,
we conclude that the results are not driven by convergence in town populations. Whether
the effects of clover are on levels or growth is unclear from these estimations, but column
(6) suggests that there are temporary effects on growth given the evidence of conditional
convergence.

5.5 Channel regressions

In this section, we probe into the channels through which clover increased agricultural pro-
ductivity and long run development and provide suggestive evidence on mediating variables.
We carry out cross-section regressions in which we investigate whether clover adoption in
1805 predicts (1) cow density; (2) crop yields of barley, rye, and wheat (calculated as harvest
per seed); (3) crop yields for potato; (4) cooperative creamery density; (5) human capital.
The logic is to test whether clover adoption in 1805 affected these outcomes. In practice, we
estimate the following model using the instrumental variables estimator:

yi  α + βcloveri ,1805 + X

(cid:3)

i γ + εi ,

(4)

The outcomes denoted by yi are number of cows per square kilometer from the agricultural
census of 1838; rye, barley, wheat and potato yields also from the agricultural census of 1838;
and cooperative creameries per square kilometer from Jensen et al. (2018). We introduce
human capital measures below. β captures the effect of clover. The control variables are
denoted by the (column) vector, Xi . They include the historical measure of suitability for

42 The measure by Zabel et al. (2014) is based on fewer crops and is more likely to suffer from endogeneity
issues as compared to the Caloric Yield Measure. While it is spatially less coarse, it includes soil conditions,
and for some parts irrigation, which makes the variable endogenous.

123

418

growing barley as well as suitability for growing potatoes both calculated as shares. εi is
the usual error term. To take endogeneity of clover adoption into account, we instrument by
alfalfa suitability. The data are cross-sectional for the historical subnational unit known as
herred, as also mentioned above, and shown in Figure A13 in Appendix B. Since the data are
cross-sectional, we cannot include ﬁxed effects for each herred, so to take out the level effect
of historical suitability we add our historical measure of barley suitability introduced above
(see also Appendix A) as well as the measure for potato suitability. The idea is here that we
do not want to confound the effects of clover with persistent suitability for growing cereals
or potatoes. By including these variables, we add credibility to the exclusion restriction.

As mentioned above, one of the possible channels concerns yields of barley, rye, and wheat
and relates to the nitrogen hypothesis of Chorley (1981) and Allen (2008). Therefore, we
test whether cereal yields increased because of clover, which would corroborate the nitrogen
hypothesis. The second mechanism is that clover contributed to a greater number of cows
(per square kilometer) by being a fodder. This in turn will lead to increased production of
milk, butter, and meat. These are underlying channels through which “the standard model”
of Allen (2009) results in agricultural productivity that drives urban populations analyzed
previously.

Column (1) in Table 5 shows the ﬁrst stage results. They indicate that alfalfa suitability
and clover adoption are strongly related. Column (2) of Table 5 provides evidence that clover
led to more cows, as a herred with higher shares of the area with clover had a signiﬁcantly
higher number of cows per square kilometer. In columns (3)–(5), we investigate the effect
on yields for rye, barley, and wheat.43 The instrumental variables estimates are all large and
signiﬁcant at least at the 10 percent level (for results based on estimation by OLS, see Table
A19 in Appendix B). Thus, the data are consistent with the nitrogen hypothesis.

We also note that increasing the number of cows locally may have been important for the
take-off of the cooperative creameries, which arose at the end of the nineteenth century; see
also Henriksen (1999) and Jensen et al. (2018). The cooperative creameries took advantage of
industrial technologies in the late nineteenth century and are often regarded as being pivotal
for the Danish economic take-off. In this way, clover contributed to the take-off of the Danish
economy. In fact, when we run an instrumental variables model with cooperative creameries
per square kilometer in 1890 as the outcome, clover is positively and signiﬁcantly related to
this variable, see column (6) in Table 5.

As discussed in Carillo (2018), it is possible that agricultural productivity also affects
human capital accumulation. Education could inﬂuence farmers’ ability to understand and
evaluate new inputs, and it is likely that the returns to education increase when the techno-
logical environment is changing.

Since standard measures of human capital such as literacy and enrollment rates as the
available data do not vary by region, we test the impact of the adoption of clover on human
capital formation as captured by the number of folk high schools per square kilometer in
1905.44 Folk high schools were targeted at young adults (aged 16–25) from the countryside

43 When we use data from the agricultural census for Germany of 1886 from the Prussian Economic History
Database (Becker et al. 2014) with 518 observations, we also ﬁnd strong, positive relationships between clover
yields and the yields of wheat and barley; see columns (4)–(6) in Table A2 in Appendix B. This supports the
nitrogen hypothesis as being a mechanism of increased agricultural productivity from clover.
44 Available data suggest that literacy rates were increasing during the nineteenth century. Some evidence
suggests that they had reach about 70 percent in the period 1825–1850 (Markussen 1990). She also reports
that data for military recruits in 1873 suggests a literacy rate of 86 percent. Schooling became compulsory in
1814 and reported enrollment rates are close to a hundred percent and do not vary by market town (Statistics
Denmark 1870).

and would typically teach hygiene in the production of milk, cultivation of plants and more
general knowledge about democracy and how to participate in society (Jensen et al. 2018).
Information on the schools in existence in 1905 are available in Statistics Denmark (1907).45
In column 7 of Table 5, we show that clover adoption inﬂuenced folk high school density.
The coefﬁcient on the clover share is positive and statistically signiﬁcant at the 1 percent
level. The coefﬁcient on clover in the equation for agricultural school density is positive, but
small and insigniﬁcant (not reported). The insigniﬁcant result could suggest that clover did
not stimulate the very speciﬁc education at the agricultural schools, but it should be kept in
mind that there were only 14 schools of this type, which may reduce statistical power. Yet,
the results support that clover adoption had an impact on human capital via the folk high
schools.

We do not ﬁnd evidence in favor of Kjærgaard’s contention that clover was important for
potato yields (not reported). In fact, visual inspection of the data suggests that the areas that
could grow alfalfa well were less suited for growing potatoes. We have further tested whether
a larger clover area is consistent with better opportunity for the honey bee as proposed by
Kjærgaard (1995). We ﬁnd that, in fact, there is such an effect. This leads us to conclude that
clover helped turn Denmark into a “land of milk and honey” as suggested by P.E. Lüders.46
To further investigate the importance of the variables in Table 5 in explaining the result
for urban populations, we have treated these variables as mediating variables. We believe
that doing so could be suggestive of the importance of the different channels.

For all the variables, we have matched the market towns to the herred in which they are
located. We then interact the variables from the 1838 census with a dummy which is one
after 1834 and zero otherwise.47 The cooperative creameries were not in existence until after
1880 and so we exploit that they could not inﬂuence urban populations before 1890, and use
an interaction with a dummy which is one from 1890. For folk high schools, we use data for
folk high school density in which we use the timing of the establishment of the schools.

The results are shown in Table 6. Regarding cow density and cooperative creameries, we
ﬁnd that these exert a zero direct or negative inﬂuence, see columns 1 and 5. The estimated
effect of clover becomes larger, but it should be noted that conﬁdence intervals strongly
overlap for estimates with and without these mediating variables. For grains a similar picture
emerges, though in this case, the mediating variables are signiﬁcant in some cases, see
columns 2 to 4. Yet, we note that for barley yields that are available for the full sample,
the coefﬁcient is insigniﬁcant. The coefﬁcient on the human capital measure is positive
and signiﬁcant, and reduces the effect and signiﬁcance of clover to the 10 percent level, see
column 6. This evidence suggests that the effect of clover on urban populations was mediated
by its inﬂuence on human capital. Yet, it should be kept in mind that one challenge to the
interpretation of the results in Table 6 is that the mediating variables could be endogenous to
urban population themselves.

It is possible that the expansion of clover was accompanied by an expansion of traditional
nitrogen ﬁxing crops such as peas. To examine whether our results can in part be explained by
this, we test whether alfalfa suitability is associated with higher yields of peas using the data
from the Danish agricultural census of 1838. This would reveal whether alfalfa suitability
simply captures the suitability for growing peas. In Table 7, we provide evidence on this

45 There were 71 folk high schools in existence in 1905. There were also 14 agricultural schools in existence
in the same year. The agricultural schools targeted the same age group as folk high schools, but the curriculum
was narrowly focused on agriculture (Statistics Denmark 1907).
46 The results for potatoes and bees are available upon request.
47 Because of missing data for some herreder, we lose a few market towns when using these data.

IV

This table demonstrates that alfalfa suitability is not related to peas, which is also a nitrogen ﬁxing crop.
The outcome of the table is pea yields. The estimations in columns (1)–(3) are by OLS and by instrumental
variables in column (4). Robust t-statistics are in square brackets
***p < 0.01; **p < 0.05; *p < 0.1

using data at the herred level. In column (1), we ﬁnd a positive, yet insigniﬁcant, correlation.
In columns (2) and (3) we control for the suitability of potatoes and barley, and the coefﬁcient
becomes negative. When we run an instrumental variables regression like those in Table 5,
we ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient is negative and insigniﬁcant for clover. All these results suggest
that our identifying variation is unrelated to yields and suitability of peas, and instead capture
suitability for alfalfa and clover.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have evaluated the impact of clover on Danish market town populations.
We present evidence suggesting that clover mattered for the development and that exogenous
changes to agricultural productivity may contribute to long-run development as captured by
urban population and urbanization rates. This effect is present despite the movement of the
economy to a more liberal trade regime, and is unlikely to be driven by institutional hetero-
geneity, the expansion of railways, general productivity in agriculture, and other potential
confounders.

We also investigated potential channels. Our results suggest that clover did affect both
agricultural productivity and human capital accumulation, and also indicate that the effect
of the adoption of clover on urban populations was mediated by its impact on human capital
formation.

One may reﬂect upon whether the results translate to other contexts. As noted above, clover
has also been deemed important for the case of England as suggested by Allen’s estimates
and the ones by Chorley (1981) for northwest Europe. This indicates some generality of our
results, but as noted above, the English system of crop rotation was slightly different than

123

the one used in Denmark. Moreover, alfalfa may have played some role in the German case
as suggested by the Prussian Economic History Database. Nonetheless, the results indicate
the importance of legumes, and it seems plausible that soil conditions and knowledge about
growing methods determined which legumes were adopted.
