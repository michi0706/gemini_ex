Most governments in the world, including the U.S., prohibit sex work. Given these types of laws
rarely change and are fairly uniform across regions, our knowledge about the impact of decriminalizing
sex work is largely conjectural. We exploit the fact that a Rhode Island District Court judge unexpectedly
decriminalized indoor sex work to provide causal estimates of the impact of decriminalization on
the composition of the sex market, reported rape offences, and sexually transmitted infections. While
decriminalization increases the size of the indoor sex market, reported rape offences fall by 30% and
female gonorrhoea incidence declines by over 40%.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the last 15 years, the American prostitution market has shifted from a primarily outdoor
(street-based) to indoor market (massage parlors, escort agencies, and much of the online market)
(Cunningham and Kendall, 2011). The indoor market constitutes up to 85% of all sex work activity
in the U.S. (Urban Justice Center, 2005). Though prohibited, the world’s oldest profession thrives
and grows indoors. The prostitution trade is estimated to generate over $14 billion a year in the
U.S. (Havoscope, 2013). Different data sources suggest that anywhere between 16% and 30% of
men have paid for sex in the U.S. (General Social Surveys, 1992–2010; Langer et al., 2004).

Most governments in the world, including the U.S., prohibit prostitution. This is likely due to
moral concerns, though disease transmission and victimization risks associated with sex markets

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

are salient policy concerns (Posner and Silbaugh, 1996). For example, the 1992 National Health
and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) shows that 23% of female sex workers report they have ever
had gonorrhoea compared to 4.7% for females who have never been paid to have sex. Given
the average sex worker sees 200–300 clients per year, and men have a 20% risk of getting the
infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected woman while women have a
60–80% risk of getting the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected man
(National Institutes of Health, 2001), the spread of disease is a signiﬁcant public health concern.
Sex market-related violence is also common. The incidence of rape and homicide victimization
is extremely high for women engaged in prostitution (Miller and Schwartz, 1995; Brewer et al.,
2006).

The aim of this article is to provide quasi-experimental estimates of the causal effect of
decriminalizing indoor prostitution on the composition of the sex market (supply and price),
population sexually transmitted infection (STI) outcomes, and reported female rape offences
by using an unanticipated legal interpretation of a long-standing statute. We focus on reported
rape offences and gonorrhoea incidence due to the high association each has with prostitution
(Ross et al., 2012).

The theoretical effect of decriminalization on sexual violence and STI transmission is
ambiguous. Decriminalization lowers the costs associated with supplying and purchasing sex
services, so we would expect decriminalization to expand the market.An expansion in sex services
may increase population STIs due to the increase in the size of the sexual network. More sex
work, in other words, might lead to more STI transmission. But some research suggests that
higher STI rates are not necessarily guaranteed if lower risk sex workers enter the network. More
sex in the population, even among sex workers, may reduce an STI epidemic if the marginal sex
worker has lower background risk or engages in safe behaviours that dilute the risk in the sexual
network (Kremer, 1996; Kremer and Morcom, 1998).

The effect of decriminalization on rape is equally complex and unclear. Decriminalization will
increase sexual violence if violence is an increasing function of the number of women employed
in the market. Cho (2015) suggests that prostitution and sexual violence are complements under
prohibition regimes since the two behaviours are positively correlated in cross-sectional data.
But Bisschop et al. (2017) show that the two are negatively correlated when law enforcement
create legal zones for purchases. Decriminalization could result in safer work spaces since
ﬁrms might be more willing to invest in security due to well-deﬁned property rights post-
decriminalization. Sex workers may also be more willing to cooperate with police as police
can now extract fewer rents. Thus, it is unclear what we should expect theoretically from
decriminalization.

We estimate the causal impact of decriminalization by exploiting the fact that a Rhode Island
(RI) District Court judge effectively decriminalized indoor prostitution in July 2003 (Arditi, 2009).
Neither the event nor its consequences have been widely understood or studied by researchers.
Indoor prostitution was ultimately re-criminalized in November 2009, but for approximately
6 years, Rhode Island was the only state in the U.S. with unbridled, decriminalized indoor
prostitution and prohibited street prostitution with the decision being made in such a signiﬁcant
and unanticipated way.

We ﬁrst show that this judicial decision, which decriminalized the indoor sex market, had
bite. Decriminalization decreased sex worker arrests, expanded the size of the indoor prostitution
market, increased indoor prostitution advertising, and decreased transaction prices. We then
estimate the causal effect of decriminalization on reported rape offences and female gonorrhoea
incidence and ﬁnd robust evidence that decriminalization caused reported rape offences to
decrease by 30% and gonorrhoea incidence to decrease by over 40%.

DECRIMINALIZING INDOOR PROSTITUTION 1685

It is poorly understood whether laws and regulation can reduce the potential costs associated
with prostitution. Some social scientists have proposed a system which involves decriminalization
of indoor sex work (as opposed to uniform criminalization), but few governments have been
willing to experiment with the policy (Weitzer, 2011). It has been argued that indoor prostitution
typically involves less exploitation, less risk of violence, more control over working conditions,
more job satisfaction, and higher self-esteem (Weitzer, 2005). Street prostitution has higher rates
of gonorrhoea (Willcox, 1962; Dunlop et al., 1971; Potterat et al., 1979), rape and sexual assault
(Church et al., 2001). However, none of these studies provide causal estimates, and most are
plagued by statistical problems due to reliance on small, non-representative samples based on
convenience sampling. In addition, despite the greater prevalence of indoor sex work, the majority
of research has focused on street work. Given prostitution laws rarely change and are fairly
uniform across regions, knowledge about the impact of decriminalizing indoor sex work is largely
conjectural.

This is the ﬁrst article to evaluate the decriminalization of prostitution in the U.S. using a
natural experiment, which allows us to provide causal estimates on the impacts of decriminaliza-
tion. Bisschop et al. (2017) show that opening legal street prostitution zones in the Netherlands
reduces sexual abuse and rape; Cameron et al. (2016) show that unexpectedly criminalizing sex
work in Indonesia increases STI rates and decreases condom use; Lee and Persson (2015, 2016)
provide theoretical analysis of how decriminalization affects the market for sex work.

This study contributes to the economics of prostitution literature by extending analysis to
policy changes, particularly the decriminalization of indoor sex work. The literature on sex work
in economics primarily begins with the seminal paper by Edlund and Korn (2002) suggesting that
if prostitutes compromise marriage market prospects, they must be compensated, thus explaining
the ﬁnancial premium to sex work. Arunachalam and Shah (2008) argue the premium to sex
work is not due to the marriage market but is compensation for risk. A related strand of this
literature estimates the premium to risky, non-condom sex in the sex market (see Rao et al., 2003;
Gertler et al., 2005; Robinson and Yeh, 2012; Arunachalam and Shah, 2013). Only recently has
the economics literature started investigating the relative merits of policies impacting the sex
market (see e.g., Gertler and Shah, 2011; Immordino and Russo, 2015; Lee and Persson, 2015;
Cameron et al., 2016; Bisschop et al., 2017).

It is important to note that the outcomes of interest in this article are not only prostitution
related—we use population level STI outcomes and reported rape offences. This allows us to say
something about the impacts of decriminalization as they relate to the population at large, not
just sex workers. We estimate that approximately 5–50% of the decline in gonorrhoea is from
sex workers with the rest coming from the general female population in Rhode Island. While we
cannot quantify how much of the rape reduction is coming from sex workers, we believe some
proportion of the decrease in rape offences is coming from non-sex workers. If anything, sex
workers are more likely to report rape offences to police after decriminalization (WHO, 2005),
so the fact that we are ﬁnding overall decreases suggests that non-sex workers are also part of
this decrease.

Police agencies, lawmakers, and prosecutors all over the U.S. have responded to the growth
in the indoor sex market by reallocating large amounts of resources towards arresting indoor
sex workers. This reallocation has been considerably costly for local police since the indoor
market is more diffuse and hidden.1 This research can inﬂuence change in policies related to

1. In a 2009 suit, Illinois Cook County Sheriff, Tom Dart, sued Craigslist for its role in “facilitating prostitution”
and requested $100,000 in compensation for police man-hours the county had incurred to pay police to investigate
prostitution advertisements on the website. His suit claimed that “between January and November 2008 his department
devoted 3,120 man-hours and approximately $105,081 to make 156 arrests” (Rigg, 2010).

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

police enforcement of laws against prostitution. Decriminalization of indoor prostitution has
experienced the most political traction as an alternative to uniform criminalization. In fact,
Amnesty International recently passed a resolution calling for the decriminalization of sex work
across the globe (Amnesty International, 2015).

2. RHODE ISLAND’S DECRIMINALIZATION HISTORY

The great irony of Rhode Island’s decriminalization of indoor prostitution is that it was
unintentional. All evidence suggests that a 2003 District Court judge’s decision, which caused the
de facto decriminalization of indoor sex work, was due to the court’s discovery that a May 1980
amendment to section 11-34 of the General Laws of Rhode Island had created an inadvertent
legal loophole decriminalizing indoor sex work (COYOTE et al., 1980; Pet, 1981; DeM, 1998).
Legislators attempting to strengthen the state’s enforcement of street prostitution passed a May
1980 amendment deleting seemingly innocuous phrases describing prostitution sex acts.2 The new
1980 law prohibited pandering (e.g. pimps), brothels, and loitering for the purpose of prostitution
(e.g. street solicitation) but in rewriting the statute, the amendment removed certain key phrases
that addressed the commission of the act of prostitution itself. The new law’s careful wording
explicitly forbade street prostitution and street solicitation, but by failing to identify non-street
prostitution (e.g. massage parlour prostitution), the new law had created a legal technicality in
which indoor sex work was legalized (Breton, 2005; Arditi, 2009).

Despite the radical implications of the 1980 law change, there is no evidence that this
interpretation was well understood. Direct and indirect evidence suggests that legal scholars,
law enforcement and the public at large were unaware of indoor prostitution’s new legal status.3
Surviving members of the 1980 legislature have said their intention was to reduce the time
between arrest and penalties for street prostitutes, not decriminalize indoor prostitution (Arditi,
2009).4

The de facto decriminalization of indoor prostitution became effective policy in late 2003
when District Court Judge Bucci dismissed charges against a group of massage parlour employees
arrested and charged with “loitering for the purposes of street prostitution” arguing that current
law did not apply to indoor prostitution in Rhode Island ex rel. City of Providence v. Choe, No.

2. At the time, residents of the Providence neighbourhood West End were “up in arms” about the amount of street
prostitution occurring in the neighbourhood and complained to their representative Matthew Smith, Speaker of the House.
Smith was advised by then-District Court Chief Judge Henry Laliberte that “to get prostitutes off the streets, [the state
should] make prostitution a misdemeanor crime instead of a felony [so as] to speed prosecution in the courts” because he
believed similar legislation in Oregon and New York had proven successful at reducing prostitution (Pet, 1981; Arditi,
2009). The main purpose of the May 1980 amendments was the creation of new statutes devoted exclusively to street
prostitution workers (§11-34-8) and street prostitute clients (§11-34-8.1), as well as downgrading the penalty from a
felony to a misdemeanor (DeM, 1998).

3. For example, a newspaper search shows that the ﬁrst time newspapers acknowledge the decriminalization of
indoor prostitution is March 2005 (Breton, 2005), 25 years after the May 1980 amendment itself. Widespread knowledge
of the 1980 amendment’s signiﬁcance is also difﬁcult to reconcile with the fact that Rhode Island police arrested massage
parlour employees for violating §11-34-8 and §11-34-8.1 from the mid-1990s until 2003. A more reasonable interpretation
is that the May 1980 amendment accidentally deleted key language from §11-34-5 that decriminalized indoor prostitution,
and both because it was inadvertent, and because of the extensive bans on more common ﬁrm structures (e.g. pimping,
streetwalking), no one thought to press the issue until the law was re-interpreted in 2003.

4. Senator John F. McBurney III, the only member of the 1980 General Assembly still serving, claims the May
1980 amendment accidentally decriminalized indoor prostitution by saying that the legislators “didn’t know what they
were voting for”. John Revens, Jr., who served in the 1980 General Assembly, said that “[the 1980 General Assembly]
would never sponsor a bill decriminalizing prostitution if they knew what it was. No way. Not in a million years” (Arditi,
2009).

DECRIMINALIZING INDOOR PROSTITUTION 1687

61-2003-03314 (6th Div. Dist. Ct. 2003) (Arditi, 2009). Breton (2005) states that police became
powerless to arrest prostitutes or their customers inside massage parlours.

3. DATA

Our study uses six unique data sets: crime arrests and reported rape offences from the
Uniform Crime Reports (UCR); gonorrhoea cases from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)’s
Gonorrhoea Surveillance Program ; data on sex worker and transaction characteristics from a
popular website called The Erotic Review (TER); weekly classiﬁed advertisements from the “adult
services” section and restaurant advertisements from The Providence Phoenix; sexual behaviour
outcomes from the 1992 NHSLS; and state-level covariates from the Current Population Survey
(CPS).

Prostitution arrest data and arrest data for other crimes (rape, murder, larceny, burglary, car
theft, robber, and assault) is obtained from the Summary UCR Part II offences database for every
state from 1999–2009. These are arrests per 100,000 population, and rates are aggregated from the
jurisdiction level to the state level. This data allows us to investigate whether decriminalization
did in fact constrain police efforts.

We also collect information on reported female forcible rape offences from the Part I Summary
UCR database for every state from 1999 to 2009. This data is downloaded as rape offences per
100,000 population at the state level.5 UCR deﬁnes a forcible rape offence as an offence satisfying
the following deﬁnition:“carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.” Attempts
or assaults to commit rape by force or threat of force are also included.6 We note that reported
rapes are likely to be an underestimate of actual rape offences.7

Our measure of STI is the natural log of female gonorrhoea incidence per 100,000 female
population and the natural log of male gonorrhoea incidence per 100,000 male population. Data
was requested from the CDC Gonorrhoea Surveillance Program, and we use state-level data from
1999 to 2009. Gonorrhoea is chosen as opposed to syphilis or chlamydia because the demographics
of gonorrhoea make it more suitable for a study of this kind given its movements suggest a
heterosexual vector, compared to syphilis which is today almost exclusively concentrated among
men having sex with men (CDC, 2010).8

In Table 7, in the Appendix, we show that prostitution is signiﬁcantly correlated with

gonorrhoea and not chlamydia for both men and women.

5. The arrest data is retrieved from the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (https://www.icpsr.

umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/) and the rape data is from http://www.ucrdatatool.gov.

6. This deﬁnition goes all the way back to 1928. In December 2011, the deﬁnition was revised to “penetration,
no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another
person, without the consent of the victim.” This was motivated by the belief that the previous deﬁnition was outdated
(Rivera, 2012). However, this does not affect our decriminalization analysis which ends in 2009.

7. One concern is whether decriminalization changes the rate at which women report rapes. While we cannot think
of a reason that non-sex workers would be more/less likely to report rape offences after decriminalization, sex workers
if anything, will be more likely to report rape after decriminalization as they are no longer engaging in illegal activities
(WHO, 2005). Since we ﬁnd a decrease in reported rape offences, this implies we might be estimating a lower bound.

8. Epidemiological differences between gonorrhoea and chlamydia may explain why gonorrhoea is statistically
more common among high-risk individuals in the heterosexual sexual network. Gonorrhoea is relatively symptomatic
compared to other STIs such as chlamydia, which is almost entirely asymptomatic. Given how observable the gonorrhoea
symptoms are, most people except for highly active individuals stop having sex once infected. This is not necessarily
the case for less symptomatic STIs like chlamydia where individuals continue to be sexually active while infectious. In
addition, unlike other STIs, gonorrhoea has a short incubation period making it a better approximation of contemporaneous
sexual behaviour. For instance, HIV symptoms appear only in advanced stage HIV, which may be years from the date of
infection, whereas gonorrhoea symptoms materialize within days of infection (National Institutes of Health, 2001).

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

We also harvest data from an online review site called The Erotic Review. TER, a reputation
website similar to Yelp.com, is one of the largest sex websites in the country and only covers
indoor sex workers. Customers use it primarily to provide feedback on transactions with sex
workers in a particular area. We collect approximately 90,000 records from TER database from
1999 to 2007 from all over the country. We identify Rhode Island-based sex workers by using
phone number area codes. We primarily use the data to focus on the types of services provided,
transaction prices, and provider race.

The Providence Phoenix is a local weekly arts and adult entertainment publication. The “adult
entertainment” section was used by the massage parlour establishments in Providence, the most
populous city in Rhode Island, and surrounding areas for advertising. Shapiro (2009) notes that
The Providence Phoenix was the main newspaper coordinating buyers and sellers in RI’s indoor
sex markets. As a comparison group, we also collect weekly data on restaurant advertisements
from The Providence Phoenix. We collect information on every advertisement by week from the
ﬁrst week of January 2000 until the last week of December 2008. Together the TER and The
Providence Phoenix data provide a nice snapshot of the sex market.

The 1992 National Health and Social Life Survey is one of the most comprehensive
representative surveys to date on sexual behaviour in the U.S. general population. These data
contain over 1,600 variables from a national probability sample of 3,432 American males and
females between ages 18 and 59.

Finally, we use state-level covariates from the CPS (1999–2009) on demographics and

economic factors. These variables serve as control variables in the regression analysis.

Summary statistics for all of the important variables from these various data sets are presented

in Table 1.

4. DID DECRIMINALIZATION INCREASE THE INDOOR SEX MARKET?

Decriminalization should expand the size of the indoor sex market by reducing the costs of entry
both for sex workers and ﬁrms (i.e massage parlours, brothels). Once the activity is decriminalized,
sex workers are less likely to be arrested and/or harassed by police, and ﬁrms can choose to
invest since they now have secure property rights. As the indoor sex market increases, we also
expect the stigma-related costs of entry to decrease (Guista et al., 2009). Therefore, we predict
an unambiguous increase in the size of the indoor sex market post-decriminalization, and if
indoor and outdoor sex workers are imperfect substitutes,9 a net increase in the number of women
employed overall in the sex market. In fact, Lee and Persson (2015) provide a theoretical analysis
of the impact of decriminalization of prostitution and show that it leads to an expansion of the
size of the market, a decrease in prices, and a compositional change of the workers serving in the
market.

We empirically investigate whether prostitution arrests, supply of indoor prostitution,
and transaction prices change post-decriminalization. We formalize this relationship with the

9. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the U.S. street sex market so we cannot test whether decriminalization
of indoor sex market affects the street market. However, empirical evidence suggests the street market has declined
substantially since the early 1990s both in Rhode Island and the U.S. while the internet/indoor market has grown
(Cunningham and Kendall, 2011). There is also evidence suggesting that the labor market for street and indoor workers
is quite separate. For example, Cameron et al. (2016) show that criminalizing indoor sex work in Indonesia does not
increase the size of the informal street sector. Therefore, it is unlikely that street workers are transitioning into the indoor
market since street and indoor workers are not substitutes. In terms of client demand, there is some evidence that street
and indoor prostitution may be substitutes for clients on lower segments of the demand curve (i.e. men who do not wish
to pay too much) (Holt et al., 2014).

These are summary statistics from UCR (1999–2009), CDC (1999–2009), TER (1999–2007), and CPS (1999–2009) data.

following regression model:

yst = αs+γt+β·I{s= RI}·I{t≥2004}+ψXst+st

(1)

The variable yst represents an outcome for state s and year t such as prostitution arrests (later rape
offences and the natural log of gonorrhoea incidence). The model includes state ﬁxed effects (α),
year ﬁxed effects (γ ), and an error term (). In some speciﬁcations we also include time varying
state-level controls (X). The coefﬁcient of interest is β which is the difference-in-difference (DD)
estimate of the effect of decriminalization on prostitution arrests in Rhode Island.

Inference from this DD approach relies on asymptomatic approximations associated with
the assumption that the number of individuals within a state and/or the number of states grows
large. However, this assumption does not apply in our setting since treatment occurred in only
one state. We implement a variant of Fisher’s permutation or randomization test (Fisher, 1935)

to address this inference problem. To implement the procedure, we estimate equation (1) an
additional 50 times replacing RI with an indicator for one of the other forty-nine states or the
District of Columbia. Then we compare the RI estimate to the ﬁfty placebo estimates obtained.
With ﬁfty placebo estimates, achieving 10% signiﬁcance from a two-tailed test requires that
Rhode Island be ranked second from the top or bottom of the placebo distribution, while 5%
signiﬁcance requires that Rhode Island be ranked at the top or the bottom. In Figure 1, we
provide graphical illustrations (histograms) from the placebo-based inference results for each
outcome of interest. The vertical dashed bars present the 5th and 95th % conﬁdence intervals
(excluding Rhode Island) and the solid line represents the DD estimate for Rhode Island. This
is a very demanding statistical test to achieve statistical signiﬁcance at conventional levels
(Buchmueller et al., 2011).

The key identifying assumption of equation (1) is that the outcome in Rhode Island would
not have evolved differently to other states in the U.S. in the absence of decriminalization. We
estimate equation (2) to explore this assumption.

yst = αs+γt+βt·I{s= RI}·I{t=2000,2001,2002,...,2012}+st

(2)

All variables are as deﬁned above in equation (1) but βt is a vector which takes on a unique
value for each year from 1999–2012.10 The base year is 1999. The solid vertical line in each
ﬁgure denotes decriminalization. Figure 2 plots the coefﬁcients (βt) on Rhode Island-speciﬁc
year effects for each outcome (prostitution arrests, rape, gonorrhoea) generated from equation
(2). The dashed vertical lines are the sampling distributions for the placebo estimates from the
5th–95th percentile for each year.

Table 2 reports the results from estimating equation (1). We list the 5th and 95th percentiles
of the distribution of the placebo estimates as well as the corresponding p-value from a two-
tailed test of the Rhode Island estimate. All models include state and year ﬁxed effects and the
even columns also include time variant controls from the CPS such as female population, male
population, unemployment rate, share of population below poverty line, share of population in
military, share of white population, share of black population, share of population that is male
and single, share of population that is female and single, share of population that is male and
married, and share of population that is female and married.

We report the results from estimating equation (1) for the dependent variable prostiution
arrests per 100,000 in columns 1–2 of Table 2. The results indicate there is a 26% (column 2) to
40% (column 1) decrease in prostitution arrests from 2004–09. Once we include control variables
in column 2, the coefﬁcient decreases in magnitude and loses statistical signiﬁcance. In the top
Panel of Figure 2, we plot βt from equation (2) for prostitution arrests. Figure 2 shows that Rhode
Island is not signiﬁcantly different from the rest of the U.S. pre-decriminalization, but there is a
decrease in arrests post-decriminalization relative to the rest of the U.S.

We also examine the effect of decriminalization on massage provision as well as transaction
prices using data from one of the largest online sex websites in the country, TER. We expect an
increase in the provision of massages since anecdotal evidence suggests the Providence massage
parlour sex industry grew post-decriminalization. We estimate equation (1) but the dependent
variable is now massage provided (0/1) and log price. TER data is downloaded with geographic
identiﬁers, which tend to be deﬁned at the city level (a few minor exceptions include the Hawaiian
islands, the Carolinas, New Mexico, and New Jersey), so we estimate forty-three placebo estimates
using the TER geographic categories (where αs from equation (1) is now the TER geographic

10. We show an additional 3 years of data (2010–2012) because later in the article we investigate what happens to

the main outcome variables when Rhode Island re-criminalizes indoor sex work in late 2009.

categories as opposed to state ﬁxed effects). Columns 3–6 include year and geographic ﬁxed
effects and columns 4 and 6 additionally control for whether the provider is an independent
contractor.

In columns 3–6 of Table 2, we present evidence that massage provision increases and prices
decrease post-decriminalization. Massage provision by RI sex workers increases by over 200%
after decriminalization. Transaction prices decrease 33% between 2004 and 2009, which is
what economic theory would predict given the increase in supply. Both results are statistically
signiﬁcant at conventional levels.

Since the Internet market is only one snapshot of the market for sex, we also collect data
from The Providence Phoenix newspaper. In Figure 3, we present an index showing weekly
advertisements in the “adult services” (top panel) section and local restaurants (bottom panel)
of The Providence Phoenix newspaper. For each type advertisement, we present the number
of advertisements (solid line) and the total amount of newspaper space advertisers purchased
(dashed line) that week. The value of the index equals a given week’s total counts divided by the
starting value in Week 1. An index value of 2 is equivalent to a doubling in that week relative
to the ﬁrst week. The decision to decriminalize corresponds immediately to an increase in the
size of newspaper space advertisers like massage parlour owners purchased. About 1 year after
decriminalization, the number of unique advertisers doubled, where each remains until 2007
before rising again. This massage parlour growth corresponds with the large increase in massage
service provision shown in the TER results above.

In the bottom panel of Figure 3, we report comparable indices for local restaurant advertising
in The Providence Phoenix as a placebo. There is no noticeable effect visible from the series,
though restaurant advertising appears more volatile.11

Taken together, the results on arrests, massage provision, transaction prices, and massage
parlour growth suggests that decriminalization did increase the size of the indoor sex market, and
that this judicial decision was not simply some artifact without implications. We now turn to the
main outcomes of interest: sexual violence and gonorrhoea incidence.

5. IMPACT OF DECRIMINALIZATION ON SEXUAL VIOLENCE

As shown above, decriminalization increased the size of the indoor sex market in Rhode Island.
Decriminalization will increase sexual violence if violence is an increasing function of the number
of women employed in the sex market. Some argue that prostitution comes with extremely high
rates of physical and sexual violence, and increasing the size of the market, even the indoor
market, will cause violence against women to increase (Farley, 2005).

However, most of the recent empirical evidence lends itself to hypotheses suggesting decreases
in violence. Bisschop et al. (2017) evaluate the opening of legal street prostitution zones in
twenty-ﬁve cities in the Netherlands on registered sexual abuse and rape and ﬁnd that legal street
prostitution zones are associated with a 30–40% decrease in sexual abuse and rape. Nguyen
(2016) ﬁnds reducing costs to opening massage parlours leads to as much as a 28% decrease in
rape offences in California.

Decriminalization increases the return on capital by providing well-deﬁned property rights
to owners. Firms can use additional revenue to invest in locks, security cameras, and security
personnel to reduce the opportunity of premeditated client violence (Brents and Hausbeck,
2005). Decriminalization may also reduce violence by increasing sex worker willingness to

11. The results from these ﬁgures are robust to regression analysis. The size of adult services advertisements
increases immediately by over 100%. The number of unique weekly advertisers also increases by over 100% during this
period from 2004–08 (results available upon request).

cooperate with police and reducing opportunities for police corruption. Church et al. (2001)
ﬁnd that only 34% of prostitutes who are victims of violence by clients report it to the police.
Levitt and Venkatesh (2007) ﬁnd that a high prevalence of police ofﬁcers demand sex from
prostitutes as part of an implicit exchange to avoid arrest. If decriminalization increases the
likelihood of victims reporting crimes to the police, then it lowers the expected return to a
potentially violent client in addition to the aforementioned deterrent effects of security (Ehrlich,
1973).12 It also implies that police can extract fewer rents from these women.

12. Philip Markoff, the so-called “Craigslist Killer”, was charged with the armed robbery and murder of an alleged
sex worker named Julissa Brisman whom he met via an advertisement in the adult services section of the Boston Craigslist
website. Markoff’s next victim, Corinne Stout, managed to avoid the same fate by screaming for help and alerting the
man she used for security located in the next room of the attack in time. Markoff ﬂed, and Stout contacted the police
who caught Markoff within days. This attack occurred at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island in April 2009
when indoor prostitution was still decriminalized (Associated Press, 2009). While anecdotal, it supports the point that
decriminalized sex work removes some of sex worker’s unwillingness to cooperate with police.

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

Decriminalization might also beneﬁt populations other than sex workers. For example,
decriminalization of indoor prostitution could allow police resources to be reallocated away
from indoor arrests towards other crimes. The freeing up of police personnel and equipment to
other areas could ultimately cause other crime rates like rape to decrease (Draca et al., 2011;
Adda et al., 2014). A ﬁnal mechanism by which decriminalization could reduce male violence
is if prostitution is a substitute for violence against women (Posner, 1992). This theoretical
possibility dates back to Catholic theologian and moral philosopher, Thomas Aquinas (Dever,
1996). The proposed hypothesis is that men on the margin between rape and prostitution may
choose prostitution since it becomes cheaper and more easily available post-decriminalization.
Given decriminalization of indoor prostitution has the potential to exacerbate or ameliorate
sexual violence outcomes, we investigate these issues empirically in Table 2. We estimate equation
(1) where the dependent variable is reported rape offences per 100,000, and the results are
displayed in columns 7–8. The results show that decriminalization reduces rape offences, and
the estimate is statistically signiﬁcant in both columns. Decriminalization reduces rape offences
31–34% from 2004–09. From 1999–2003 reported rape offences in the U.S. are 34 per 100,000
and 40 per 100,000 in RI. From 2004–09, rape rates decrease to 27.7 per 100,000 in RI while the
U.S. remains the same at 34.1 per 100,000. The middle panel in Figure 1 shows that the Rhode
Island estimate ranks ﬁrst compared to the rest of the placebo estimates, indicating this results is
statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level. This is the strongest possible ranking from the permutation
test.

In Figure 2, we show that the trends in Rhode Island relative to the rest of the U.S. are
fairly similar pre-decriminalization. The middle panel of Figure 2 illustrates that the Rhode
Island coefﬁcient is not signiﬁcantly different in rape offences from the ﬁfty placebo estimates
pre-decriminalization, but this changes post-decriminalization.

5.1. Sexual violence pathways

We consider several potential pathways that relate decriminalization to the falling reported rape
offences we observe in the data.

First, it is possible that the ruling caused rapes to fall through extensive or intensive margin
changes in police resources and/or effort. We check the extensive margin to investigate if there
are any changes in overall police employment post–decriminalization. Our data comes from the
FBI’s UCR Law Enforcement Ofﬁcers Killed orAssaulted (LEOKA) data set which reports police
employment annually. Figure 7 in the Appendix plots this data for Rhode Island and the rest of
the U.S. We do not ﬁnd any changes in police employment post-decriminalization.13

On the intensive margin, since police stop arresting indoor sex workers, these police resources
could be reallocated elsewhere in the agency including the policing of rape and other sex crimes.
We investigate this hypothesis by testing whether decriminalization impacts arrests per offence
for all crimes in the UCR data (rape, murder, larceny, burglary, car theft, robbery, and assault)
using equation (1). Table 3 reports the results from this exercise. Decriminalization does not
signiﬁcantly impact rape arrests per offence, and importantly the coefﬁcient is zero. It also
appears that decriminalization does not signiﬁcantly impact arrests per offence for any other
crime (columns 2–8). However, we note that conﬁdence intervals are wide and in some cases we
cannot reject increases in arrests for a particular crime. We are somewhat reassured by the fact
that the coefﬁcients are small and not systematically positive. In column 1 of Table 3 we generate

13. We also estimate DD models of police employment and do not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant evidence that

decriminalization impacts police employment in RI (results available upon request).

These are DD regressions (equation 1) using UCR data (1999–2009). We present 5th and 95th percentile conﬁdence
intervals from permutations tests and p-values from a two-tailed test based on the distribution of placebo effects. Each
dependent variable is arrests/per crime.All models include state and year ﬁxed effects. Controls include female population,
male population, unemployment rate, share of population below poverty line, share of population in military, share of
white population, share of black population, share of population that is male and single, share of population that is female
and single, share of population that is male and married, and share of population that is female and married. The baseline
mean is the 1999–2003 RI mean. **Signiﬁcant at the 5% level. * Signiﬁcant at the 10% level.

a measure which includes all arrests per offence. The coefﬁcient of interest from this regression
is close to zero and negative. Therefore, it seems unlikely that a reallocation of resources is
responsible for the observed decline in rape offences. We also note that in Rhode Island, the
Ofﬁce of Narcotics and Organized Crime has been the principal agency responsible for arrests
of massage parlour employees, and this is not the same ofﬁce which pursues perpetrators of rape
and other sexual crimes. Conversations with law enforcement ofﬁcials in Rhode Island suggest
that the reallocation hypothesis was unlikely in this particular case.

Secondly, we investigate whether changes in data collection or data deﬁnitions over this
period could explain the ﬁndings, and fail to ﬁnd evidence for this. The rape models are estimated
using state by year data from the UCR. It could be the case that jurisdiction level attrition is
causing the observed decrease in rape offences. We re-estimate the models using data based on
jurisdiction level ﬁles (see Chalﬁn and McCrary, forthcoming for a description of these data).
We re-estimate equation (1) with both a balanced and unbalanced panel of jurisdictions using
forcible rape offences as the dependent variable from this data set. The results in Table 8 indicate
that jurisdiction attrition cannot be driving the rape result, as the results are robust to both the
balanced and unbalanced panel of jurisdictions. In fact, 91.2% of all jurisdictions appear in the
data consistently from 1999–2009.

We also spoke directly with the Providence police to understand whether any personnel or
deﬁnitional changes were made that could explain the drop in rapes. We were assured by the
Providence Police Department, the Rhode Island State Police, and the FBI that the UCR counts
deﬁnitions did not change during our study period. We also inquired about personnel changes
during this period that would have been relevant for the collection and distribution of the UCR
records, but no such personnel changes were reported to have taken place. Another possible
“deﬁnition” related explanation for the decline in reported rapes in the UCR data concerns the
introduction of the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) in 2004. As NIBRS
deﬁnes rapes more broadly than UCR Summary deﬁnitions, the introduction of a second crime data
collection programme may have impacted the reporting of UCR Summary data. However, while
some smaller jurisdictions in Rhode Island may have adopted NIBRS in 2005, Providence does not
start using NIBRS until 2007 (Rhode Island State Police, 2016), 4 years after decriminalization.

REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

Thirdly, decriminalization could reduce rapes among sex workers by improving the bargaining
position of female sex workers relative to clients (Lee and Persson, 2016). Recent work in
economics has shown that changes in female bargaining threat points has the potential to reduce
violence against women (Stevenson and Wolfers, 2006; Aizer, 2010; Hidrobo and Fernald, 2013;
Bobonis et al., 2013). Several studies note that indoor sex workers report considerably lower risks
of victimization relative to outdoor street walkers, who themselves report extremely high rates
of victimization (Church et al., 2001). While improvements in the safety of sex workers may be
occurring, it is unlikely to explain the entirety of the rape results. Sex workers constitute a low share
of total reported rape offences given the illegal nature of their work (Bridgett and Robinson, 1999).
Hence, even if decriminalization reduces actual rapes among sex workers, it would not reduce
reported rapes by too much since pre-treatment reporting is likely to be lower than post–treatment
reporting which would bias us against ﬁnding the decrease.

The last hypothesis is related to the idea that some violent males think of rape and prostitution as
substitutes (Posner, 1992; Dever, 1996). When the judicial decision caused supply to increase and
prices to fall, violent males at lower segments of demand could have shifted towards purchasing
sex indoors and away from violence towards women. In fact, Ciacci and Sviatschi (2016) ﬁnd that
indoor prostitution decreases sex crimes with no effect on other types of crime. They generate a
daily panel from January 2004 to June 2012 with the exact location of police stops for sex crimes
and the day of opening and location of indoor prostitution establishments in New York City. They
argue that the reduction in sex crimes is driven by potential sex offenders that become customers
of indoor prostitution establishments. In addition, while anecdotal, in the 2010 documentary
Happy Endings which is about the efforts of Rhode Island to re-criminalize indoor sex work,
there is a scene where a sex worker claims the men she services would likely rape other women
had they not come to see her (Hurley, 2009). Therefore, this substitution could be driving the
rape result.

6. IMPACT OF DECRIMINALIZATION ON PUBLIC HEALTH

Conceptually, decriminalization has an ambiguous effect on STI. Assuming a net increase in the
number of indoor sex transactions, decriminalization could increase the scale and growth rate of
a gonorrhoea epidemic. However, if decriminalization shifts transactions indoors to lower STI
risk sex workers and/or draws in lower risk sex workers, then decriminalization may reduce an
epidemic.

Kremer and Morcom (1998) provide conditions whereby increasing the number of sexually
active individuals in a sexual network would paradoxically cause HIV prevalence to decline.
A decrease in STIs could occur if new entrants into the sex work network are lower risk thus
diluting the propagation mechanisms fueling the epidemic. It may also cause street transactions
to decrease by causing some clients of street prostitutes to shift indoors, thereby decreasing the
size of the outdoor market which tends to be riskier. The ﬁnding that indoor sex work is less risky
in terms of public health outcomes is consistent across various countries (see Seib et al., 2009
for Australia; Jeal and Salisbury, 2007 for the UK; Shannon et al., 2015 for Kenya and Canada).
Given decriminalization of indoor prostitution has the potential to exacerbate or ameliorate
public health outcomes, we investigate this issue empirically. We estimate equation (1) and the
dependent variable is log gonorrhoea incidence per 100,000 females. In Table 2 (columns 9-10),
we ﬁnd that decriminalization decreases gonorrhoea incidence 47% from 2004–09. From 1999–
2003 gonorrhoea incidence in the U.S. was 113.4 per 100,000 females compared to 81.4 per
100,000 females in Rhode Island. From 2004–09, the rate in the U.S. stays similar at 108.4 per
100,000 females but Rhode Island declines to 43.1 per 100,000 females.

DECRIMINALIZING INDOOR PROSTITUTION 1699

This result, like rape, ranks ﬁrst in the permutation test giving it a p-value of .04. The bottom
panel in Figure 1 shows that the Rhode Island estimate ranks ﬁrst compared to the rest of the
placebo estimates indicating this results is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level. This is the
strongest possible ranking from the permutation test. In Figure 2, we show that Rhode Island is
not signiﬁcantly different in gonorrhoea incidence from the rest of the U.S. pre-decriminalization
but this changes post-decriminalization. In fact, the permutation results for Rhode Island from
2006 to 2011 show that the β estimated for Rhode Island is much lower than the β’s estimated
for the other ﬁfty placebo states.

6.1. Public health pathways

In this section, we provide evidence about why decriminalization may have decreased gonorrhoea
incidence. Decriminalization likely caused gonorrhoea to decrease by diluting the “core group”
through the selection of lower risk sex workers into the network (Hethcote and Yorke, 1984;
Kremer and Morcom, 1998) and by reducing risky sex among indoor sex workers.

First, Section 4 suggest that the indoor sex industry grows post–decriminalization. This is
likely changing the composition of the prostitution market, and might be diluting the core group
by selecting lower risk sex workers into the network. Empirical evidence suggests that indoor
sex workers have lower rates of disease than street sex workers. For example, Loff et al. (2000)
estimate an 80-fold higher prevalence of bacterial STI among illegal street workers compared with
legal sex workers. In Table 4, we show the change in indoor sex workers by racial category using
TER data. The largest and only statistically signiﬁcant change is coming from an increase in Asian
providers (see columns 3-4) by eighteen percentage points. The CDC Gonorrhoea Surveillance
data we use reports gonorrhoea rates by race. Interestingly, the mean gonorrhoea rate per 100,000
from 1999–2003 by race in Rhode Island is 26.1 for Asians, 48.6 for whites, 182.4 for Hispanics,
and 596.2 for Blacks. Interestingly, Asians have the lowest rates of gonorrhoea incidence, so more
Asian women entering the market should result in an overall lower risk pool, ceteris paribus.

If low-risk individuals increase their activity by a larger proportion than high-risk individuals,
the composition of the pool of available partners will improve (Kremer and Morcom, 1998). This
implies that male clients are now more likely to match with safer (i.e. gonorrhoea free) sex
workers, and we should observe an overall decrease in gonorrhoea—which we do. Interestingly,
Gertler and Shah (2011) ﬁnd that increasing enforcement in the street prostitution market in
Ecuador by one standard deviation per month is signiﬁcantly associated with a 27% lower rate of
sex workers being currently infected with syphilis, chlamydia, and/or gonorrhoea. The mechanism
at play here is similar: enforcement changes the composition of workers in the street market. This
is closely related to the mechanism in Lee and Persson (2015) where decriminalization induces a
compositional change of workers that raises the share of voluntary prostitutes in the sex market
(relative to involuntary prostitutes).

Secondly, Table 4 (columns 9-16) shows the estimates from DD models using TER data on
four sex act outcomes associated with risk behaviours: fellatio with and without a condom, vaginal
sex, and anal sex.14 The results suggest that sex acts become less risky after decriminalization
as we observe decreases in anal sex, vaginal sex, and oral sex without condoms and increases in
oral sex with a condom. The decreases in anal sex and vaginal sex are statistically signiﬁcant at
conventional levels while the oral sex results are not statistically signiﬁcant with the permutation
tests. It is likely that increases are also occurring in manual stimulation. Unfortunately this is not an

14. TER does not provide the option to report whether vaginal or anal intercourse occurred with or without a

condom.

option in the TER data so we cannot measure it. However, Nguyen (2016) shows that quasi-legal
prostitution ﬁrms like massage parlours most frequently offer manual stimulation, whereas illegal
prostitution ﬁrms most frequently offer intercourse. In her data, 61.2% of massage transactions
include manual stimulation. The results in Table 4 are consistent with other empirical evidence
showing that sex workers who work indoors practice safer sex and are less likely to contract and
transmit STIs (Seib et al., 2009; Seib et al., 2009; Gertler and Shah, 2011).

The results suggest that decriminalization could have potentially large social beneﬁts for the
population at large—not just sex market participants. For the female gonorrhoea estimates we
calculate that approximately 5–50% of the decline in gonorrhoea is from female sex workers.
The rest is likely from female non-sex workers. We estimate the proportion of women who are
sex workers in Rhode Island, though we note that the number of sex workers in the U.S. is
not known, and estimates vary widely. Potterat et al. (1990) estimate that the annual prevalence
of full-time-equivalent sex workers in the United States is 23 per 100,000 individuals, on the
basis of a capture-recapture study of prostitutes found in police and STD clinic records in
Colorado Springs between 1970 and 1988. This estimate is still widely used today (e.g. see
Brewer et al., 2000; Delavande et al., 2010). Based on this study, we generate the population of
sex workers for each year in Rhode Island, multiply by 3.9%, the proportion of sex workers who
have gonorrhoea (El Paso County Department of Health and Environment, 1999), to estimate the
number of sex workers with gonorrhoea each year in Rhode Island. Our calculations suggest
that even if every single sex worker with gonorrhoea went from having gonorrhoea to not
having gonorrhoea due to decriminalization, this could only account for approximately ﬁfty
fewer cases of gonorrhoea from 2004–09 or 5% of the decline due to decriminalization. Sex
worker gonorrhoea prevalence would have to be 95% to fully explain the decline due to
decriminalization. If we take the unrealistically large estimate that 1% of women in the US
are sex workers (Alexander, 1987), this would still only account for 52% of the decline in
gonorrhoea cases due to decriminalization if prevalence is 3.9%. Under these assumptions,
sex worker gonorrhoea prevalence would have to be 7.5% to fully explain the decline due to
decriminalization.

Lastly, we investigate male gonorrhoea as an outcome of interest. If it is the case that
decriminalization is resulting in less risky behaviour and a change in the sexual network, we
might expect a decrease in male gonorrhoea incidence as well. We estimate equation (1) where
the dependent variable is log male gonorrhoea cases per 100,000 males. The results are presented
in columns 11–12 of Table 2. Decriminalization decreases male gonorrhoea incidence by 25–
30% and this result is statistically signiﬁcant in column 11 (p=0.08) but the p-value increases
to 0.16 in column 12 once we add control variables. It appears likely that men are beneﬁting
from decriminalization as well—though we note we cannot differentiate between male clients
and non-client males.

7. ROBUSTNESS: SYNTHETIC CONTROL ANALYSIS

A complementary and alternative method for causal inference with aggregate data and one
treatment unit is synthetic control analysis. As a robustness exercise, we implement the synthetic
control approach which is a generalization of the DD framework (Abadie et al., 2010). However,
unlike the DD models, the synthetic control model uses a subset of units for controls. This
method selects control states that exhibit the same pre-treatment dynamics as RI. If there is any
concern that the rest of the U.S. is not the right control group, then this model addresses that
issue.

We follow Abadie et al. (2010) and use an inferential technique based on several placebo
exercises. We apply the treatment year to every state in our sample of ﬁfty-one state units (ﬁfty

(RMSPE) pre-treatment, and then apply those weights to the outcomes for our synthetic control
ex–post. We generate a ratio of the post/pre-treatment RMSPE for each state. This ratio should
be high for Rhode Island, suggesting that the model ﬁt the pre-treatment trends well (represented
by a small RMSPE) but has failed to replicate the post–treatment series (represented by a large
RMSPE). We rank the ratio of post/pre-treatment RMSPE for all ﬁfty-one units in our sample
from highest to lowest. The probability that chance could have produced the Rhode Island result is
the rank order of Rhode Island in that distribution divided by the number of units (e.g. 51) which
allows us to examine whether the effect of decriminalization is large relative to the distribution
of the effects that we estimate for states not exposed to decriminalization.

7.1. Prostitution arrests synthetic control results

The synthetic control analysis for prostitution arrests uses the same UCR data from Table 2,
but we extend the time series back to 1985 since Abadie et al. (2010) show that if the number
of pre-intervention periods in the data is large, then matching on the pre-treatment outcomes
helps control for any heterogeneity of unobserved and observed factors on the outcome of
interest.

The top panel in Figure 4 shows the synthetic Rhode Island trajectory before and after
decriminalization compared to the actual outcome. The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows how
well the model ﬁts the data. The synthetic control model suggests that decriminalization resulted
in 21.8 fewer prostitution arrests per 100,000 relative to the estimated counterfactual from 2004
to 2009, which is about a 53% decrease. This estimate is larger than the DD result presented
above which suggests a 26–40% decrease. The large estimated decline in arrests is due in part to
synthetic RI rising relative to actual RI. Insofar as our synthetic RI is valid, the model indicates
that arrests would have been ﬂat or risen slightly in absence of decriminalization. In the DD
models above, the control group (i.e. the rest of the U.S.) does not experience this uptick in
arrests, which is likely why that estimate is smaller.

We present the actual and synthetic characteristics from our model in Table 9 in the Appendix.
The states which make up synthetic Rhode Island are reported in Table 10 in the Appendix. Next
we apply the synthetic control model to all ﬁfty additional state-units for the placebo analysis.
Rhode Island has the sixth highest ratio of post–RMSPE to pre-RMSPE relative to any other state
unit, implying a p-value of 0.118 (see top panel of Figure 9 in the Appendix for the distribution
of RMSPE ratios).

7.2. Rape synthetic control results

The rape analysis uses the same data from the DD models in Table 2 from the UCR but again
we extend the time series back to 1965. To minimize the volatility in the series we smooth the
rape series using the moving average of the current and previous year’s rapes. We present results
from the synthetic control model in Figure 5 and map the gap in prediction error in the bottom
panel. The synthetic control model suggests that rape offences decreased by 14 per 100,000 or
32%. This result is qualitatively similar to the DD result of 30% above.

Table 10 shows that the synthetic control is a weighted average of Idaho (0.342), New
Hampshire (0.162), North Dakota (0.140), and South Dakota (0.355). Figure 9 (middle panel)
in the Appendix shows that Rhode Island has the third largest ratio of post/pre-treatment
RMSPE, implying that if one were to assign decriminalization at random, the probability

Figure 4

of obtaining a post/pre 2003 RMSPE ratio as large as Rhode Island’s is 0.059 (or that the
p-value=0.059).

7.3. Gonorrhoea synthetic control results

The synthetic control analysis of gonorrhoea uses the same data from the DD models in Table
2 from the CDC’s Gonorrhoea Surveillance Program for 1985 to 2009. We present results from
the synthetic control model in Figure 6. Decriminalization resulted in 33 per 100,000 fewer
cases of female gonorrhoea relative to the estimated counterfactual from 2004 to 2009 which is
about a 43% decrease. Again the synthetic control result is qualitatively similar to the DD result
presented above.

We conduct the same placebo inference described above. The bottom panel of Figure 9 in
the Appendix reports the results from this exercise. For female gonorrhoea, Rhode Island has the
highest ratio of post–RMSPE to pre-RMSPE relative to any other state unit, implying a p-value
of 0.0196.

Reported rape offences per 100,000. Rhode Island versus Synthetic Rhode Island (A) Trends in rape: RI and synthetic

Figure 5

8. RE-CRIMINALIZATION OF INDOOR PROSTITUTION

Rhode Island ultimately re-criminalized indoor sex work in November 2009 with the passage of
bill HB5044A. If we believe this should result in the opposite response to decriminalization, then
we should observe an increase in prostitution arrests, a decrease in the supply of sex work, and
an increase in transaction prices. Gonorrhoea incidence and rape offences would likely increase.
If we look at the simple Rhode Island yearly effects relative to the rest of the U.S., Figure 2
suggests there might be a slight increase in rape offences and gonorrhoea cases after prostitution
is re-criminalized. We formalize these relationships by using equation (1), but add an additional
term to capture the impact of re-criminalization. We use all of the same data sets as above, but
extend all series to 2012. The estimating equation becomes:

yst = αs+γt+β1·I{s= RI}·I{t≥2004}+β2·I{s= RI}·I{t≥2010}+ψXst+st,

(3)

where β2 is the DD estimate of the effect of re-criminalization on the outcomes of interest. The
re-criminalization term equals one for Rhode Island from 2010 to 2012. The coefﬁcient β1 is the

Log female gonorrhoea per 100,000. Rhode Island versus Synthetic Rhode Island (A) Trends in female gonorrhoea: RI

and synthetic RI; (B) Gonorrhoea gap between RI and synthetic RI.

Figure 6

DD estimate of the effect of decriminalization on sex worker outcomes in Rhode Island, where
the decriminalization term equals one for Rhode Island from 2004–12. All other variables are the
same as before.

Table 5 reports the results for prostitution arrests, massage provision, transaction price,
reported rape offences, and the natural log of gonorrhoea using equation (3). Panel A reports
β1 and panel B reports β2. The results for β1 are qualitatively similar as before so we focus on
β2. Table 5 shows that prostitution arrests do not change signiﬁcantly due to re-criminalization,
though massage provision decreases eleven percentage points and prices increase 25 percent.
Interestingly, we do observe a decrease in the number of reviews in the TER data in Rhode Island
immediately following re-criminalization (see Figure 8 in the Appendix). However, by 2012, the
trend bounces back to the growth trend of the rest of the U.S.

In terms of the main outcomes of interest, while rape offences do appear to increase
3.9–4.0 cases per 100,000, the p-value is 0.2-0.3. Table 5 also indicates there is no statistically
signiﬁcant impact of re-criminalization on gonorrhoea incidence, at least in the ﬁrst two
years post re-criminalization. There is also no signiﬁcant impact of re-criminalization on male

CUNNINGHAM & SHAH

DECRIMINALIZING INDOOR PROSTITUTION 1707

gonorrhoea which is as expected since we do not observe changes in female gonorrhoea
incidence.

In Table 6, we report results from estimating equation (3) using the TER data on services
and race of the provider. Re-criminalization decreases the likelihood of an Asian provider and
increases the probability of Hispanic providers suggesting that re-criminalization makes the pool
of providers riskier. While there is no statistically signiﬁcant change in the types of services
provided, the positive signs on the anal and vaginal sex coefﬁcients suggest a possible increase
in risky behaviour.

The re-criminalization analysis does not tell as clean a story as the decriminalization results.
This is likely due to anticipatory effects and the short time period of data. Re-criminalization
was anticipated, unlike the initial judicial decision that caused decriminalization; the push to
re-criminalize started as early as 2006. Some claim that massage parlour owners and workers
started leaving even before re-criminalization occurred, as they knew it was inevitable. Therefore,
empirical results could be biased due to anticipatory effects. Secondly, we have data until 2012
(at the time of writing), which is only 2 years post re-criminalization. Consequently we have a
short post-treatment window and may be underpowered to detect effects. For example, Figure 2
shows that the decline in gonorrhoea due to decriminalization lags at least a year, with the largest
decline occurring in 2008, 4 years after decriminalization.

9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

This study provides causal estimates of the impact of decriminalization on the sex market as
well as outcomes related to sexual violence and public health. The results from all empirical
models (DD and synthetic control) are quite consistent, speaking to the strength of the
results.

Decriminalization reduces sexual violence by 30%. Rape has high direct costs to society.
McCollister et al. (2010) using contingent valuation techniques estimate that the cost per rape
offence is $240,776 in 2008 dollars. This estimate includes both tangible cost such as criminal
justice costs and intangible costs such as pain and suffering. Therefore, decriminalization has the
potential to result in large savings in terms of rape offences.

We show that decriminalization improves public health outcomes by decreasing female
gonorrhoea incidence by more than 40%. This has direct beneﬁts for individuals but likely
results in positive externalities as well. For example, the presence of comorbid STIs such as
gonorrhoea, can increase the likelihood of HIV transmission (Galvin and Cohen, 2004; Oster,
2005). Shannon et al. (2015) claims decriminalization of sex work would have the greatest effect
on the course of HIV epidemics across all settings, averting 33–46% of HIV infections in the next
decade. Therefore, ﬁnding a reduction in gonorrhoea is likely understating the gains to public
health.

The results suggest that decriminalization could have potentially large social beneﬁts for the
population at large—not just sex market participants. Almost 19 million new cases of STDs
occur in the U.S. each year, and the annual direct medical costs of treating STIs (including HIV)
is estimated at 11–17 US billion in 2003 dollars (Chesson, 2006). For the female gonorrhoea
estimates we calculate that approximately 5–50% of the decline in gonorrhoea could be from
female sex workers. The rest is likely from non-sex workers. While we cannot do the same
calculation for rape offences, we believe some proportion of the decrease in rape offences is
coming from non-sex workers. Sex workers are more likely to report rape after decriminalization,
so the fact that we are ﬁnding overall decreases suggests that non-sex workers are likely part of
this decrease.

DECRIMINALIZING INDOOR PROSTITUTION 1709

Finally, while the ﬁndings in this article point to positive impacts of decriminalization, we
note that there are other outcomes impacted by decriminalization that have not been addressed
here. Prostitution is morally repugnant for some individuals so decriminalizing the indoor
market may impose moral costs that are difﬁcult to quantify. In addition, others have argued
that decriminalization may increase human trafﬁcking (Cho et al., 2013). However, good data
on numbers trafﬁcked is extremely difﬁcult to uncover given the clandestine nature of this
market.

APPENDIX

In this section, we describe the ﬁgures and tables in the Appendix. Table 7 shows that prostitution, either as a male
client or a female sex worker, is positively associated with ever having had gonorrhoea, but not with chlamydia. In
Table 8, we re-stimate equation (1) using rape offence data based on jurisdiction level ﬁles (see Chalﬁn and McCrary,
2017 for a description of these data). We do this with both a balanced and unbalanced panel of jurisdictions to test whether
jurisdiction attrition is responsible for the sizable declines in reported rapes in Rhode Island following decriminalization.
Table 8 shows it is not.

Figure 7 shows the changing trajectories of police employment for Rhode Island and the U.S. (excluding Rhode
Island) before and after decriminalization using the FBI’s UCR LEOKA data set. The data is available through 2005. The
ﬁgure shows that police employment trends in Rhode Island did not change after decriminalization.

Figure 8 shows the effect that re-criminalization had on the number of sex worker reviews using TER data for both
Rhode Island (solid line) and the U.S. (excluding Rhode Island). The number of reviews fell by approximately one-third
in 2010, but immediately rose afterwards, catching up with the national trend. The overall effect of re-criminalization
appears to have been a temporary large disruption in the market.

We used synthetic control methods to estimate the effect of decriminalization on arrests, reported rape offences,
and log gonorrhoea incidence as a robustness exercise. Inference in this methodology requires calculating the post-
and pre-treatment RMSPE, and then taking the ratio. A larger ratio implies that the post-treatment RMSPE is larger
than the pre-RMSPE, whereas a ratio closer to unity implies the effect sizes are similar pre- and post-treatment. In
the rape model (middle panel of Figure 9), the ratio is ranked third in the distribution of all ratios, in the gonorrhoea
model (bottom panel of Figure 9), the ratio is ranked ﬁrst, and in the arrests model (top panel) the ratio is ranked
sixth.

In Table 9, we describe the covariates used in the synthetic control models, and Table 10 presents the weights from

the synthetic control models. All weights are constrained to be non-negative and sum to unity.

These are OLS regressions using the NHSLS 1992 data where dependent variable in each model is dichotomous variable
equalling 1 if the respondent has ever had gonorrhoea or chlamydia. All models include Census region ﬁxed effects
and NHSLS household sampling weights. Even numbered columns additionally include controls for race, sex, age, age
squared, marital status, maternal education, alcohol drinking behaviour, whether respondent lived with parent at age 14,
whether alternative living arrangements occurred at age 14, and residence location at age 14. Heteroskedastic robust

These are DD regressions (equation 1) using jurisdiction level raw UCR data (1999–2009) from Chalﬁn and McCrary
(2017). We present 5th and 95th percentile conﬁdence intervals from permutations tests and p-values from a two-
tailed test based on the distribution of placebo effects. Each dependent variable is arrests/per crime. All models
include state and year ﬁxed effects. Controls include female population, male population, unemployment rate, share
of population below poverty line, share of population in military, share of white population, share of black population,
share of population that is male and single, share of population that is female and single, share of population that
is male and married, and share of population that is female and married. The baseline mean is the 1999–2003 RI
mean. **Signiﬁcant at the 5% level. * Signiﬁcant at the 10% level.

Police employment does not change post–decriminalization.
