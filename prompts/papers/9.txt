This paper studies the reduced-form effects of constitutional-level balanced budget rules (BBRs) on ﬁs-
cal outcomes. Using historical data for a large set of countries dating back to the nineteenth century and
applying a difference-in-difference design we ﬁnd that the introduction of a constitutional BBR leads to a
reduced probability of experiencing a sovereign debt crisis. We estimate that debt-to-GDP ratio decreases
by around eleven percentage points on average, most of these consolidation being explained by decreas-
ing expenditures rather than increasing tax revenues. Using the same methodology and sample, we do
not ﬁnd evidence that non-constitutional BBRs included in national legislation affect these variables. Addi-
tional estimates gained from applying the synthetic control method on nine selected case study countries in
Africa, Europe, and Latin America are consistent with the main ﬁndings, but also highlight the importance
of country speciﬁc circumstances when evaluating the success of BBRs.

1. Introduction

Average government debt-to-GDP and spending-to-GDP ratios
around the world roughly doubled in the ﬁfty years after WWII. Com-
pared to the few data points that we have from the late nineteenth
century, the spending-to-GDP ratio has roughly quadrupled. In a long
and heated debate, both academics and policy makers have ques-
tioned the reasons for the problem of running persistent deﬁcits and
thereby accumulating debt. The global economic and ﬁnancial crisis

of 2008–9 quickly evolved into a sovereign-debt crisis in many coun-
tries, once again bringing the issue of sustainable public ﬁnances
to the forefront of policy priorities and motivating policy makers to
ﬁnd effective and credible institutional solutions. In particular, ﬁscal
rules have become a popular instrument to constrain ﬁscal policy and
are currently promoted by national governments and international
organizations such as the IMF and the EU.

However, the use of ﬁscal rules is not a new idea, as illustrated by
US states and the Maastricht Treaty in Europe, and the global ﬁnan-
cial crisis gave prominence to the fact that governments often fail to
comply with these rules.1 As a response to the crisis and motivated
by the Fiscal Compact Treaty in Europe, a recent trend has been to
strengthen the credibility of these ﬁscal rules by enshrining them at
the highest level of law: national constitutions.2 Austria, Denmark,

1 For example, in the European Union, more than half of member states exceeded
the three percent maximum budget deﬁcit speciﬁed in the Stability and Growth Pact.
2 The Fiscal Compact – or formally the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and
Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union – requires the member states to
enshrine structurally balanced budget rules into domestic law.

Italy, and Spain are some of the countries that have passed such leg-
islation in the post-crisis era,3 joining Switzerland4 and Germany5
which are the two exceptions among advanced countries that already
had such constitutional rules.6 Other countries have hotly debated
but not implemented constitutional ﬁscal rules. For instance, in the
United States, the House of Representatives approved a balanced bud-
get amendment in 1995 that fell short by one vote in the Senate. A
similar attempt failed in 2011 (Azzimonti, 2013).7

On the other hand, about forty-ﬁve countries in the world –
particularly in Africa, Central America, and South America – have had
balanced budget rules (BBR) in their constitutions.8 Some of these
provisions date back to the end of the nineteenth century but most
were introduced in the ﬁrst and second halves of the twentieth cen-
tury in the Americas and Africa, respectively, and in Europe following
the crisis of 2008–9. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst historical
evidence on the ﬁscal effects of these constitutional ﬁscal rules.
Studying the effect of BBRs in these countries is appealing because
provisions written in a country’s constitution might be more binding
than non-constitutional laws.9 This expectation has been an explicit
assumption made by many policy makers, such as when design-
ing the Fiscal Compact Treaty, but for which no empirical evidence
exists.

This paper contributes to the existing literature on the effects of
ﬁscal rules by: (a) studying the ﬁscal effect of BBRs that are enshrined
in national constitutions; (b) analyzing historical data dating back to
WWII (as our preferred sample) but also to the nineteenth century
(as our largest sample); and (c) studying the effects of BBRs on gov-
ernment debt, expenditures and taxes, but also on the incidence of
sovereign debt crises.

Identifying the effect of (non-randomly distributed) ﬁscal rules on
ﬁscal outcomes is challenging for several reasons. First, there exists
the possibility of selection bias such that past ﬁscal outcomes might
inﬂuence the probability that a government implements a ﬁscal
rule. Second, biased estimates may arise from the failure to account
for shocks which simultaneously drive the implementation of ﬁscal
rules and correlate with ﬁscal outcomes. Third, the adoption of con-
stitutional BBRs by deﬁnition involves a change in the constitution
either through amendments or the adoption of a new constitution.

3 Others include: Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Malta, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia,
with further ongoing processes in all of the European countries that have signed the
Fiscal Compact.

4 Switzerland introduced a BBR constraining structurally adjusted balances that has
been in effect since 2003. For a quantitative case study on Switzerland, see Section 3.
5 Germany ﬁrst introduced a ﬁscal rule into its constitution in 1871 (reinstating
it in 1949). In 2009, a major amendment came (“Schuldenbremse”: Article 109.3)
that caps the level of the federal government’s structural deﬁcits at 0.35% of GDP
effective in 2016 (and the states’ level at zero, binding from 2020). The pre-2009
“golden rule” limited net borrowing to the level of gross public investment, which,
along with further and very general escape clauses, made the rule less effective (see
Feld, 2010; Ciaglia and Heinemann, 2012; Heinemann et al., 2016). Germany’s reform
kicked off a debate on whether the eurozone countries should insert a German-style
BBR into their constitutions (Janeba, 2012).

6 Portugal had a rule in the 1820s, but it was short-lived. Also, Poland (Article 216.5)
and Singapore (Article 114) have had certain constitutional limitations on borrowing
since 1997 and 1965, respectively, but it is controversial whether these should be
considered as BBRs (Lienert, 2010).

7 See Schultze (1995) and Seto (1997) for a discussion of the 1995 proposal, and
Azzimonti et al. (2016) for a welfare analysis of a 2011-type BBR with a model calibrated
to the US economy. The debate on introducing a balanced budget amendment continues
today with around half of state legislatures having passed resolutions calling for such
an amendment.

8 See Fig. 4 for a map and Table B1 in the online appendix for the list of these

countries.

9 For example, in the United States, expenditure and balanced budget rules in the
’80s and ’90s were phased out or abandoned as corresponding laws were rewritten.
Further, supranational deﬁcit caps in the European Union as deﬁned by the Maastricht
Treaty of 1992 and the original Stability and Growth Pact of 1997 were also often
exceeded which eventually led to signiﬁcant reforms of the Pact (for example, Six Pack,
Two Pack, Fiscal Compact, and further ongoing reforms).

Thus, the independent effects on ﬁscal outcomes due to any addi-
tional changes in constitutions, that occurred at the same time as the
introduction of BBRs, must be ruled out.

We start our analysis with quantitative case studies for nine coun-
tries in Africa (Cape Verde, Gabon, and Rwanda), Europe (Switzerland
and Ukraine), and Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Panama, and Peru)
employing the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal,
2003; Abadie et al., 2010).10 For each of these countries, we estimate
the counterfactual levels of ﬁscal policy variables after introducing
or abolishing a BBR; that is, the ﬁscal outcomes in a hypothetical
country with or without a BBR. These counterfactual outcomes are
then compared to the actual ﬁscal variables. In the majority of cases,
the synthetic control approach provides ﬁrst evidence that BBRs
constrain the levels of government debt and expenditures.11

Studying countries individually helps to better understand the
complex endogeneity issues associated with the adoption of these
rules. The Swiss case described in Section 3 is illustrative in that the
debt brake introduced in 2003 led to a signiﬁcant episode of ﬁscal
consolidation which, according to our estimates from the synthetic
control method, amounts to a large reduction of the debt-to-GDP
ratio by about 30 percentage points. However, as suggested by the
case study of Fig. 1, the adoption of the debt brake followed or per-
haps was a reaction to a period of steady increase of government debt
in Switzerland. This case would speak in favor of some bias coming
from the selection of already indebted Switzerland into adopting a
BBR.

For our baseline estimations, we adopt a generalized difference-
in-difference design. In its dynamic speciﬁcation, we model the
timing of the introduction of a BBR, and show that in the years lead-
ing to the adoption of BBRs the differences in outcome variables
between treatment and control countries is, on average, close to
zero. This absence of pre-trends suggests no systematic bias com-
ing from selection as long as the selection effect is: i) captured by
the observables, and ii) homogenous across countries so that the
average effect on the pre-trends does not mask potentially offsetting
trends. The use of a set of country and continent-speciﬁc year ﬁxed
effects enables us to control for unobservable factors that do not
vary within countries or within continents in given years. We also
control for country-speciﬁc parametric time-trends and capture the
effect of several time-varying observable variables such as the qual-
ity of democratic institutions, but are not able to fully account for
unobservable factors with unknown parametric functions. The case
studies also suggest that the majority of BBRs were implemented
by introducing a new constitution, which may be a confounding
event. However, when using constitutional changes as the treat-
ment variable in the difference-in-difference speciﬁcation we do not
ﬁnd evidence that these changes generally matter for our outcome
variables.

Using our preferred sample of 132 countries from 1945 to 201512
we show that; ﬁrst, the introduction of a BBR is associated with a
reduction in the likelihood of experiencing a sovereign debt crises as
deﬁned by Reinhart and Rogoff (2011). This ﬁnding shows that not

use the synthetic control method to study the effects of ﬁscal rules in, respectively,
euro-area countries, Switzerland, and one US state. Asatryan (2015) presents case
study evidence on the effects of constitutional changes, and Metelska-Szaniawska
(2016) applies the method to the analysis of constitutional changes in post Soviet
countries.
11 We perform case studies in nine out of thirty-six countries in our baseline sample
due to the higher data requirements of the synthetic control method. Please refer to
Section 3 of the Online Appendix for a detailed discussion.
12 In other speciﬁcation, our largest sample goes back to 1800 and covers at most
224 countries. While our estimates are robust across these speciﬁcations, BBRs vary
little in the early years of our sample and, therefore, we focus on the more recent data
as our preferred sample.

only the level of debt matters but also whether debt will eventu-
ally reach unsustainable levels. To our knowledge, this link between
BBRs and crises has not been previously established. Second, we
estimate that BBRs are associated with an average reduction of the
debt-to-GDP ratio by around eleven percentage points. We show that
this large ﬁscal consolidation can be mostly explained by decreasing
expenditures rather than increasing tax revenues. Third, in contrast
to these substantial evidence on the effectiveness of constitutional
BBRs, we do not ﬁnd evidence that in the same sample and using
the same methodology non-constitutional BBRs effectively constrain
either the probability of crisis or any of our three ﬁscal variables.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. After a
review of the previous literature in Section 2, Section 3 presents a
quantitative case study on the Swiss debt brake with eight further
case studies discussed in Section C of the online appendix. Section 4
presents the data on constitutions and historical public ﬁnances,
and describes our empirical strategy. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 present
the main results for the effect of constitutional BBRs on the occur-
rence of crises and on government ﬁnances, followed by several
robustness tests in Section 5.3 and the results on the effectiveness of
non-constitutional BBRs in Section 5.4. Section 6 concludes.

2. Previous literature

The literature on the political economy of government spend-
ing and debt is vast. It studies the question of why governments
persistently spend and borrow at levels that may deviate from the
prescriptions of optimal ﬁscal policies, and focuses on the set of incen-
tives shaping policy makers’ behavior (Persson and Tabellini, 2000;
Drazen, 2000). Early work (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962; Brennan
and Buchanan, 1980) put forward the hypothesis of ﬁscal illusion
to explain the reason behind persistent government deﬁcits. This
hypothesis states that voters overvalue current spending relative to
the cost of future taxation, thus violating the intertemporal budget
constraint and giving rise to a persistent deﬁcit bias. But even if voters
put suﬃcient weight on the cost of future taxation, politicians may
still overspend; for example, due to political business cycles. System-
atic overspending may also arise when agents can free-ride on the
common pool of tax contributions. This phenomenon may perhaps
be most salient in federal settings such as in Europe. In a recent paper,
Alesina and Passalacqua (2015) provide a review of the theoretical
literature on persistent deﬁcits.

One of the main policy actions aimed at preventing governments
from running persistent deﬁcits and ensuring ﬁscal sustainability has
been the use of ﬁscal rules.13 Researchers have debated the theory
of the ﬁscal and economic effects of ﬁscal rules. In models of ﬁscal
policy with a benevolent planner, ﬁscal rules may prevent the plan-
ner from running optimal ﬁscal policies (Chari et al., 1994; Stockman,
2001). This could happen if these rules constrain the policy tools
for running countercyclical ﬁscal policy, inducing suboptimal levels
of public-goods provision and public investment. Additionally, ﬁscal
rules could give rise to the use of “creative accounting” in national
statistics (see for example, Milesi-Ferretti, 2004; Von Hagen and
Wolff, 2006). In practice, however, governments do not always max-
imize social welfare as a benevolent planner would. Governments’
actions result from various political constraints and incentives that
induce deviations from optimal policies.

When such deviations are large, imperfect or second-best ﬁscal
rules may increase welfare by acting as an institutional check against
the government’s bias of running persistent deﬁcits. Thus, there exists
a trade-off between the potential costs and beneﬁts of ﬁscal rules. The
general welfare implications of this trade-off have been modeled by
several recent theoretical papers on the optimality of ﬁscal rules which
do also take account of political economy considerations. Besley and
Smart (2007) build a political agency model with moral hazard and
adverse selection, and show that the desirability of ﬁscal restraints
is linked to how benevolent governments are. Battaglini and Coate
(2008) show that constitutional BBRs can improve citizen welfare
depending on the relative size of an economy’s tax base compared
to the size of spending. Azzimonti et al. (2016) extend this model
including to a quantitative calibration. They ﬁnd that BBRs reduce
debt by increasing the expected cost of taxation, but raise the costs
of less responsive public good provision in the future. The optimality
of such discretion in policy making is also studied by Halac and Yared
(2014) using a dynamic mechanism design approach. Barseghyan
and Battaglini (2016) develop a theory of endogenous growth which

13 We understand ﬁscal rules as constraints on ﬁscal policy through numerical limits
or explicit commitments on budgetary aggregates such as budget deﬁcits or govern-
ment debt (Schaechter et al., 2012). This deﬁnition does not include procedural rules,
also called ﬁscal institutions, which regulate the drafting, approval, implementation,
and surveillance of the budget (Von Hagen, 1992; Poterba and von Hagen, 1999; Fab-
rizio and Mody, 2006; Hallerberg et al., 2007; Debrun et al., 2009). For a comparative
discussion of these two approaches, see Wyplosz (2005, 2013).

also has ceilings on ﬁscal policy. Martin (2017) additionally considers
monetary rules.14

The existence and relative size of these potential costs and bene-
ﬁts is essentially an empirical question, and a large empirical litera-
ture attempts to estimate these opposite effects. On the cost side, for
example, Levinson (1998), Fatas and Mihov (2006), and Clemens and
Miran (2012) study the effect of ﬁscal rules on the cyclicality of ﬁscal
policy and whether they ultimately affect business cycles. What the
empirical literature is most concerned with, however, is whether ﬁs-
cal rules are effective, and if so, the size of their effect on various ﬁscal
outcomes such as government debt, budget balances, expenditure, or
revenue.15

The effectiveness of ﬁscal rules has been studied extensively on
both subnational (see Poterba, 1994, 1996; Eliason and Lutz, forth-
coming for the United States; Feld and Kirchgässner (2008) for
Switzerland; and Grembi et al., 2016; Coviello et al., 2017; Bonfatti
and Forni, 2017; Alpino et al., 2018 for Italy), national (see Dahan
and Strawczynski, 2013 and Tapsoba, 2012 for OECD and developing
countries), and also supranational levels (particularly in Europe, see
Hallerberg et al., 2007; Debrun et al., 2008; Hallerberg et al., 2009;
Blume and Voigt, 2013). These are only a few examples from this
abundant literature which still contains disagreements on whether
ﬁscal rules effectively constrain ﬁscal policy, as well as on which types
of rules prevail most often and in which institutional environments.
Heinemann et al. (2018) provide a meta-analysis of this literature and
ﬁnd some support for the hypothesis that ﬁscal rules constrain ﬁscal
policies. However, after controlling for the quality of the identiﬁca-
tion strategies used in these studies, the statistical signiﬁcance of the
average result vanishes. Moreover, as discussed above, the effective-
ness of BBRs that are enshrined in national constitutions has not yet
been studied.16

The motivation for an analysis of constitutional ﬁscal rules given
the vast literature on non-constitutional ﬁscal rules is that constitu-
tional rules are expected to be more binding than non-constitutional
ones. This is because, relative to non-constitutional rules, constitu-
tional rules raise the costs associated with changing the rule, as well
as the costs associated with breaking the rule or infringing on the
rule. Speciﬁcally, as noted by Drazen (2004), statutory laws are likely
to be more short-lived compared to constitutional laws. Require-
ments to change constitutional laws, often include supermajorities in
legislatures, referendums, waiting periods and ratiﬁcation by states.
These procedures make constitutional laws more diﬃcult to change
or to revoke compared to statutory laws.

That constitutional rules are more likely to endure than non-
constitutional laws does not imply alone that they will be more
effective in constraining ﬁscal policy. For instance, politicians could
circumvent constitutional rules through creative accounting (Von
Hagen and Wolff, 2006). However, giving a law constitutional status
raises the costs of infringing or tampering with the law. For instance,
enshrining a ﬁscal rule in the constitution might raise the public

14 The following papers discuss the political economy of BBRs: Brennan and Buchanan
(1980), Niskanen (1992), Buchanan (1995), andRose (2010) . They do not provide
frameworks in which to evaluate the costs and beneﬁts of rules.
15 A related strand studies the constraining effect of ﬁscal rules that operate through
market mechanisms (see for example, Poterba and Rueben, 2001; Kelemen and Teo,
2014). The argument is that ﬁscal rules do not necessarily depend on a credible threat
of judicial enforcement, but may function through the punishment of sovereigns by
bond markets when debt or deﬁcits exceed some focal point speciﬁed in the ﬁscal rule.
Relatedly, Hatchondo et al. (2015) use a sovereign default model to show that in such
settings limiting rules on debt spreads can generate larger welfare gains than more
conventional rules on debt levels.
16 Related to constitutional studies, there exists a fairly large literature on the
economic effects of constitutions (for example, Mueller, 2003), and work that attempts
to empirically identify these effects (see Persson and Tabellini, 2003; Voigt, 2011;
Ardanaz and Scartascini, 2014). Our paper is relevant to this literature in that it
presents evidence on direct policy effects of constitutional provisions.

awareness of the law and expose politicians that break the rule to
a “negative spotlight” effect (Drazen, 2004). Similarly, constitutional
laws are often enforced by independent bodies such as constitutional
courts, raising the costs associated with breaking those laws.17

3. A synthetic case study for Switzerland

This section uses the synthetic control method to analyze the case
of Switzerland’s adoption of a constitutional BBR in 2001 through a
referendum.18 The remaining eight case studies along with a more
thorough discussion of the method are presented in Section C of the
online appendix.

The constitutional amendment in Switzerland came in 2001, with
85% approval in a referendum. The amendment became effective in
2003, with two additional years reserved for a transition period. The
Swiss rule states that the budget must be in balance after adjusting
for economic conditions. Thus, the rule calls for a structural balance in
the short-run and absolute balance over the course of a business cycle
(see Table B3 of the online appendix for Article 126 describing the
BBR. For further discussion of the Swiss debt brake, see Danninger,
2002; Geier, 2011; Pfeil and Feld, 2016).

Fig. 1 shows that following the introduction of the BBR, actual
levels of both debt and expenditure have been substantially lower
and have diverged increasingly from their counterfactual levels; that
is, the hypothetical levels of debt and expenditure had Switzerland
not passed such an amendment. Given that the assumptions of this
method hold, these ﬁndings imply that the effect of introducing a
BBR in Switzerland, at its peak, was a decrease in the debt-to-GDP
ratio of around 30 percentage points and a two percentage points
decrease in the government expenditure-to-GDP ratio.

Fig. 2 extends the analysis by restricting the pool of donor coun-
tries to developed countries only and by generating placebo tests for
each of these donors (similar to Abadie et al., 2010). The dark lines in
panels (a) and (b) represent the gap in government debt and expen-
ditures, respectively, between Switzerland and its synthetic control.
The gray lines represent gaps in government debt and expenditures
for other developed countries and their corresponding synthetic con-
trols. Notice that the gap for Switzerland is unusually large relative
to the ones observed for the rest of the sample, which lends support
to our hypothesis that the gap for Switzerland was partially caused
by the introduction of the BBR in 2003.

The Swiss case presented above suggests a strong and sizable
association between BBRs and ﬁscal outcomes. However, it may also
be seen as an illustrative example of the hypothesis that the introduc-
tion of ﬁscal rules may be triggered by deteriorating ﬁscal positions,
such as the increasing levels of debt in Switzerland in response to
the unexpectedly protracted low growth following a severe ﬁnancial
crisis in the early 1990s. In this context, the Swiss debt brake serves
as a symbol of the political resolve as driven by the conservative
ﬁscal preferences of the population. This inherent endogeneity of
constitutions illustrates the limitations that this and previous papers
face when trying to identify causal effects of ﬁscal rules.

Regarding the remainder of the case studies presented in Section
C of the online appendix, seven out of nine broadly support the
hypothesis that BBRs are negatively associated with government

17 Moreover, constitutional and non-constitutional rules might translate in different
choice-sets available to politicians. As noted by Vanberg and Buchanan (1991), “con-
stitutional choices are choices among alternative rules; sub-constitutional choices are
among alternative strategies available within rules”. Thus, enshrining a ﬁscal rule in
the constitution might provide a signal that a balanced budget is a fundamental goal
for the government, restricting politicians’ legislative activities to operate within this
constraint.
18 Pfeil and Feld (2016) also present a synthetic control analysis of the Swiss BBR and,
similar to our results, ﬁnd that the introduction of the BBR improved budget balances
by 3.6 percentage points on average in a post-intervention period covering ﬁve years.

vide a clear-cut picture. These effects are substantial in size, but vary
among countries from roughly 10 to 30% for reductions in debt ratios,
and from 1 to 7% for reductions in expenditure ratios ten years after
introducing a BBR.

4. Data and empirical design

4.1. Fiscal rules

4.1.1. Constitutional balanced budget rules

We employ a novel data set that contains information on the
characteristics of the national constitutions for all
independent
states from 1789 to the present. The data set was collected by
the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) (Elkins et al., 2014)
and has been recently used in the political science and law litera-
tures (for example, see Elkins, 2010; Cheibub et al., 2013; Ginsburg
and Versteeg, 2014; Melton and Ginsburg, 2014; Blöchliger and
Kantorowicz, 2015; Bjørnskov and Voigt, 2015).19

The left panel of Fig. 3 shows that the share of sovereign states
with constitutions increased steadily from 1816 until 1980. After
1980, almost all countries had some form of constitution.20 The left
panel also shows the share of countries that have constitutions and
have available data on central-government debt or expenditures.
After 1970, the share of countries with data availability increases
substantially because this is the starting year for most IMF govern-
ment ﬁnancial statistics.

We deﬁne a country as having a constitutional balanced budget
rule if its constitution meets two conditions. First, the constitution
must allow for the budget to be determined by accompanying legis-
lation; that is, legislation that lays out the revenues and expenditures
for the budget period. Second, the constitution must require a bal-
anced budget. Constitutions state the requirement for a balanced
budget in various ways. An example of a more precise deﬁnition is

Germany’s constitution of 1949 which states “Revenues and expendi-
tures shall in principle be balanced without revenue from credits. This
principle must be satisﬁed when revenue obtained by the borrowing
of funds does not exceed 0.35 percent in relation to the nominal gross
domestic product”. An example of a more vague deﬁnition is Ukraine’s
1999 constitution stating “The State aspires to a balanced budget of
Ukraine”.

These examples highlight the substantial heterogeneity in our
measure of constitutional BBRs. Such heterogeneity might be conse-
quence of constitutional rules being less explicit than statutory rules
due to the higher cost of changing or vetoing a constitutional rule
(Kennedy and Robbins, 2003). Additional examples of excerpts from
constitutions containing BBRs are reported in Table B3 of the online
appendix.21 Thus, our measure of constitutional BBRs can be under-
stood as an indicator for a country’s stated constitutional preference
for a balanced budget.22

In our sample, in the years with most BBR requirements, forty-
ﬁve countries had BBR requirements. The right-hand panel of Fig. 3
reports the share of countries with constitutional BBR requirements.
Fig. 4 maps these countries and Fig. 5 presents the historical time line
of BBR adoptions. In addition, Table B1 of the online appendix lists
these countries along with the time intervals with a BBR (column 3).
That table also lists the time intervals with available data on country
government debt (column 4).23

4.1.2. Non-constitutional balanced budget rules

To test the hypothesis that constitutional BBRs are more binding
than non-constitutional (or also called statuary) laws, we com-
pare the effects of constitutional and non-constitutional BBRs on
government’s ﬁnancial aggregates. Data on non-constitutional ﬁs-
cal rules are taken from the IMF’s data set on ﬁscal rules collected

19 CCP deﬁnes a document as a constitution if it meets at least one of the following
conditions: (a) the document is explicitly referred to as the constitution, fundamental
law, or basic law; (b) the document contains explicit provisions that establish its
contents to be the highest level of law, either because the document is entrenched
or it limits future law; or (c) the document changes the basic pattern of authority
by establishing or suspending an executive or legislative branch of government.
20 The data on the number of independent states over time are taken from the 2013
updated data set of Gleditsch and Ward (1999).

21 These articles were taken from a sub-set of recent constitutions for which the
Constitute Project provides English translations; see, https://www.constituteproject.
org/search?lang=en.
22 Further analysis into the content of these constitutional rules was limited by a
lack of access to the english translations of all constitutions in the CCP database.
Speciﬁcally, only the most recent version of a country’s constitution is publicly
available at the CCP website.
23 Of our outcome variables, the richer data set is the one on general government
debt. If we look at periods with BBRs and at data on government expenditures, the
sample is smaller than the one depicted in the last column of Table B1.

by Schaechter et al. (2012) which records the use and design of ﬁs-
cal rules across countries since 1985.24 In these data, a ﬁscal rule
is deﬁned as a rule that imposes a long-lasting constraint on ﬁscal
policy through numerical limits on budgetary aggregates.25 The data
concerns only with rules that cover at least the central government

and includes information on ﬁscal rules’ characteristics such as level
of implementation, legal basis, and the budget aggregate constrained
by the rule. From these data, we identify as non-constitutional BBRs
all BBRs with a legal basis other than the country’s constitution.

24 While the data identiﬁes the use and design of rules since 1985, it also provides the
year of implementation for all ﬁscal rules. We use the implementation year to identify
rules in effect prior to 1985 to better compare constitutional and non-constitutional
BBRs in our post-1945 sample.
25 In addition to rules with numerical targets ﬁxed in legislation, the data also
considers as ﬁscal rules those ﬁscal arrangements that are binding for at least three
years (for example, expenditure ceilings).

4.2. Outcome variables and controls

4.2.1. Crises and public ﬁnance data

Our objective is to identify whether there is an association
between a country’s ﬁscal performance and constitutional bal-
anced budget provisions. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the occurrence
of sovereign debt crises using the data from Reinhart and Rogoff
(2011). A debt crisis is deﬁned as a failure by the government to
meet an interest or principal payment on the due date, and also

includes episodes involving the freezing of bank deposits and/or
forcibly converting such deposits from foreign to local currency.

In addition, we study government’s debt, expenditure, and tax
revenue (as shares of GDP) as measures of a country’s ﬁscal
performance. Historical data on government expenditure and tax
revenue come from Cagé and Gadenne (2014), and data on general
government debt come from Abbas et al. (2010).26 Both of these
studies compile historical information from different sources and are
to the best of our knowledge the most extensive records available.
Cagé and Gadenne (2014) collect information on government expen-
ditures as far back as 1830, and Abbas et al. (2010) report data on
government debt from 1880 onward.

Fig. 6 plots the evolution of average levels of government debt
(subﬁgure a) and expenditure (subﬁgure b), as a percentage of GDP,
for countries with and without BBRs. As we will show later in the
paper, these averages hide a considerable amount of heterogeneity
across both time and countries. However, this ﬁrst piece of evi-
dence suggests lower levels of debt (until 1970s) and expenditure
when constitutions include explicit ﬁscal provisions for balanced
budgets.

4.2.2. Other data

As control variables in our analysis, we also include population
size, per capita income, and quality of democracy. We proxy the qual-
ity of a country’s democracy using the Polity scores from the Center
for Systemic Peace. The scores originally ranged from −10 to 10, from
complete autocracy to complete democracy, but for exposition we
normalize the score to range between zero and one. The population
and income data come from the Maddison Project database, with per
capita income measured in 1990 international dollars.27

Table 1 reports information about the central variables in our
sample. The table shows the number of countries for each variable,
as well as summary statistics and the sources of these variables.

4.3. Estimation

In our baseline estimates, we use a generalized difference-in-
differences design to estimate the average treatment effect of BBRs
(St Clair and Cook, 2015). The model has the following speciﬁcation:
yit = b0 + b1Dit + Xitb + tt + ki + md × lc + dit + eit

(1)

where i indicates countries and t indicates years. The dependent
variable yit is either a dummy for crisis years, or a continuous vari-
able measuring government debt, expenditure, or tax revenue as a
percentage of GDP. The indicator variable Dit equals one when the
constitution speciﬁes a BBR and zero otherwise. Thus, the indicators
coded as zero include country-year observations where a country’s
constitution allowed for legislation related to the budget but did not
include a BBR.28 The vector Xi t includes controls for population size,
per capita GDP, quality of democracy (Polity score normalized to
be between 0 and 1), and an indicator variable for years when the
constitution was amended or a new constitution was drafted.29 We
also control for country-speciﬁc linear time trends (d), country ﬁxed
effects (k), year ﬁxed effects (t), and for decade speciﬁc continent
ﬁxed effects (m × l).30 For inference, we cluster the standard errors
at the level of countries.

4.3.1. Identiﬁcation

Identifying the causal effect of ﬁscal rules on ﬁscal outcomes is
generally not straightforward because the adoption of such rules is
likely to be endogenous. One source of endogeneity may come from
selection bias; for example, if past ﬁscal performance inﬂuences the
probability that a country implements a rule. Second, selection bias
could also arise from the failure to account for omitted variables that
simultaneously drive the implementation of ﬁscal rules and correlate
with ﬁscal outcomes. Third, because the introduction of a constitu-
tional BBR by deﬁnition involves a change in the constitution, either

26 Abbas et al. (2010) deﬁne the general government sector as “all government units
and all non-market nonproﬁt institutions that are controlled and mainly ﬁnanced by
government units, comprising the central, state, and local governments. The general
government sector does not include public corporations or quasi-corporations.”
However, due to data limitations for the earlier years in their sample, they use
central government debt whenever general government debt was not available.

htm, 2013 version. International dollars refers to the Geary-Khamis dollar, which is a
ﬁctional currency set to have the same purchasing power parity as the US dollar.

28 We omit country-year observations with constitutions that did not allow for any
type of legislation related to the budget. This is because the subset of constitutions
that allow for legislation on the budget is more comparable. In Section 5.3, we show
that our results are robust to including all constitutions in the analysis.
29 The robustness tests of Table A2 in the online appendix additionally control for
the occurrence of civil wars.
30 In several robustness tests, we include year speciﬁc continent ﬁxed effects
(instead of m × l), but because the estimation of these many dummies is computa-
tionally prohibitive in the baseline regressions we use the decade dummies.

through amendments or through the introduction of a new consti-
tution, the potential independent effects of these additional changes
on ﬁscal outcomes must be ruled out.

To test for selection bias, we examine the trends in the outcome
variables in the periods leading to the introduction of BBR. In a mod-
iﬁed version of the generalized difference-in-difference design of Eq.
(1), we follow Autor (2003) and use leads of the treatment variable
to estimate the effect of BBRs on the outcome variables during the
ﬁve years leading to their implementation. In event-study graphs of
Section 5.3, we show that the effect of BBRs on ﬁscal aggregates and
the probability of observing crises are not statistically different from
zero during the years leading to the adoption of these rules.

The absence of average pre-trends suggests no systematic bias
coming from selection subject to two assumptions. First, it assumes
that selection is correlated with the observable variables on ﬁscal
outcomes. Second, this test is informative only for the average dif-
ference between the treatment and control groups which may in
principle mask potentially offsetting trends. The pre-trends that are
statistically indistinguishable from zero are estimated with a reason-
able precision. Therefore, it is unlikely but not fully excludable that
this average effect hides potentially offsetting effects.

Our estimates would still be biased if shocks that are omitted
from our speciﬁcation systematically affect both ﬁscal rules and
ﬁscal outcomes. For this reason, we ﬁrst control for observable vari-
ables, and secondly show that these observables do not change much

around the introduction years of BBRs. However, a central unob-
servable candidate which we cannot control for are the voters’ ﬁscal
preferences.31 To partially address this concern of omitted variable
bias, we include country ﬁxed effects and country-speciﬁc paramet-
ric time trends. These ﬁxed effects are likely to be effective with
omitted unobservable factors that are fairly constant over time, such
as ﬁscal preferences. But we cannot fully rule out this possibility.
Given the geographic heterogeneity of our sample, we also include
continent-speciﬁc decade (or year) ﬁxed effects. To the degree that
these two-way ﬁxed effects do not capture other time and within-
continent varying unobservable factors in Section 5.3, we perform
the selection-on-unobservables test proposed by Altonji et al. (2005).
In order to control for the simultaneity between constitutional
BBRs and other changes to the constitution, we introduce indicator
variables for the occurrence of constitutional reforms to partial out
changes in ﬁscal outcomes at the time of such events. In addition,
in Section 5.3 we run the dynamic version of our difference-in-
difference design on the effects of all constitutional changes and
amendments on our outcome variables, and do not ﬁnd evidence that
these changes generally matter for our variables of interest.

31 In an attempt to untangle the endogenous relation between ﬁscal rules and ﬁs-
cal performance, Heinemann et al. (2014) and Krogstrup and Wälti (2008) develop
proxies for voter preferences.

5. Results

5.1. Probability of sovereign debt crises

We ﬁrst study the effect of BBRs on the occurrence of exter-
nal or domestic crises as measured by Reinhart and Rogoff (2011).
Table 2 collects the difference-in-difference estimates. All regres-
sions control for per capita GDP, population, quality of democracy,
constitutional change, and include country and year ﬁxed effects.
The main result is that having a BBR in a constitution is associated
with a reduced probability of observing debt crises. The magnitude of
this average effect is 16.7%, which increases when controlling for the
level of government debt-to-GDP ratio in even numbered columns.
The direction of these effect are robust when controlling for conti-
nent times year speciﬁc effects in columns 3–4, and when estimating
the speciﬁcation with a poisson model in columns 5–6 instead of the
linear OLS model.

5.2. Debt, expenditure, and tax revenue

We now turn to the variables capturing government’s ﬁscal deci-
sions: the ratio of debt, expenditure, and tax revenue to GDP. Table 3
reports the difference-in-difference estimates using speciﬁcations
similar to those estimated in Table 2. Columns 1–3 and 4–6 report
the regressions on, respectively, levels and growth rates of the three
ﬁscal variables of interest. Depending on data availability of the
dependent variable, the sample size varies across speciﬁcations, from
110 to 132 countries. Given the historical nature of the data with
potential measurement errors involved, we estimate the equations
by trimming the outliers of the dependent variables at 1%.32

The main result of Table 3 is a negative, statistically signiﬁ-
cant, and economically large association between constitutional-
level BBRs and government debt and expenditure. The effect of BBRs
on tax revenue is not statistically distinguishable from zero, sug-
gesting that the BBR-induced reduction in debt is mostly achieved
by decreasing expenditures rather than by increasing tax revenues.
These results hold both for the speciﬁcation in levels and growth
rates. Regarding the magnitude, the introduction of a BBR in a con-
stitution is associated with an average decrease of debt-to-GDP and
expenditure-to-GDP ratios of about eleven and three percentage
points, respectively (columns 1–2).

Regarding the control variables, both per capita GDP and
population have negative signs when signiﬁcant, indicating that
richer and more populous countries have lower levels of government
debt and expenditure. The estimated coeﬃcients on the Polity index
of democracy are statistically signiﬁcant only in one speciﬁcation,
and the dummy for constitutional changes is never signiﬁcantly
different from zero.

5.3. Robustness tests

We add to the above baseline results by testing: (a) whether the
assumption of parallel trends holds; (b) whether economic variables
of interest change substantially around the introduction of BBRs;
(c) whether confounding events around the time of treatment drive
the results; (d) if the results can be replicated on the total sample
going back to the year 1800; (e) the sensitivity of estimates to outliers;
(f) the robustness of results to different estimation techniques; (g) the
robustness of results to alternative deﬁnitions of BBRs and a wider set
of control variables; and (h) for the possibility (and potential relative

32 For example, the maximum (99-percentile) value of debt in our sample exceeds
2000 % (240%) of GDP; the corresponding statistics for expenditure and tax revenue
ratios are, respectively, 219% (60%) and 122% (45.19%). Table 4 presents robustness
tests by averaging the data and by Winsorizing the outliers.

size) of selection bias. Finally, we test whether the enforcement of
BBRs depends on the quality of democratic institutions.

5.3.1. Parallel trends

Fig. 7 presents the results of the dynamic difference-in-difference
design on the trends in our baseline variables of interest in the ﬁve
years leading to the introduction of a BBR. Sub-ﬁgures (a), (b) and
(c) show the estimated effects of BBRs on, respectively, government
debt, expenditure and tax revenue in GDP, and sub-ﬁgure (d) shows
the probabilities of observing a crises. The effect of BBRs on ﬁscal
variables in years leading to their introduction are not signiﬁcantly
different from zero for any of the four dependent variables.

5.3.2. Changes in economic conditions around the introduction of BBRs
The introduction of BBRs may be driven by the general economic
environment or affect it directly. Fig. A1 of the Appendix implements
the dynamic difference-in-difference design following the baseline
methodology of Fig. 7 but as dependent variables taking several
measures of the relevant economic environment as well as showing
yearly point estimates following a BBR introduction. In Fig. A1, we do
not ﬁnd evidence of substantial changes in the (a) level of population,
(b) per capita GDP, (c) polity score of democracy, or (d) structural
reform activity33 around the time of our treatment.

5.3.3. Confounding events

The introduction of a constitutional BBR by deﬁnition involves a
change in the constitution. These rules are introduced either through
an amendment of the existing constitution or by drafting a new
constitution.34 These confounding treatments could partially drive
the baseline results if constitutional changes affect the outcome
variables. Our strategy in the baseline speciﬁcation was to add an
event indicator variable for constitutional changes. In Fig. A2, we
further address this concern by running placebo dynamic difference-
in-difference regressions on the effects of amendments and new
constitutions on the probability of crises and on the government
ﬁnance variables. Speciﬁcally, the placebo tests in Fig. A2 do not
show evidence that constitutional changes have an independent
effect on our four outcome variables of interest.

5.3.4. Total sample

Some countries introduced BBRs before 1945, the year when our
preferred sample starts. The pre-1945 variation in constitutional
BBRs is low with only ﬁve countries having introduced such rules.
Columns 1–3 of Table 4 report results for the main speciﬁcation
when using our total sample from 1800 to 2015 and ﬁnd results that
are similar to the baseline.

5.3.5. Sensitivity to outliers

Several exercises ensure that the main results are not driven by
inﬂuential outliers. Columns 4–6 of Table 4 estimate the baseline
speciﬁcation on data averaged over ﬁve year periods.35 Columns 7–
9 ofTable 4 Winsorize the outliers at the top and bottom 5% of
the respective distributions. Columns 10–12 of Table 4 control for
continent speciﬁc decade ﬁxed effects to make sure unusually large
continent-wide shocks do not drive the results. In addition, Table A3
of the online appendix reports re-runs of the baseline speciﬁcation
when dropping each of the countries in the sample one at a time

33 This variable on structural reforms is an index between 0 and 1 where larger num-
bers represent more deregulation. The data is made available by Prati et al. (2013)
annually for the period 1973–2006 at the level of several sub-indices (trade, cur-
rent account, agriculture, network, domestic ﬁnance, and capital account) which we
average to one index here.
34 In our sample, about 90% of BBRs are introduced with new constitutions.
35 The BBR variable in these regressions is the share of years within the period that a
constitution included a BBR, rather than a dummy as in the baseline case.

Notes: The dependent variables are government debt, expenditure and tax revenue, and are measured as a share of GDP in percentage points in columns 1–3 and as annual growth
rates in columns 4–6. Outliers of the dependent variables are trimmed at the top and bottom percentile of the distribution. All regressions include country and year ﬁxed effects
(not reported). Standard errors are clustered by country.

and shows that the inclusion of no single country can account for the
baseline results.

5.3.6. Robustness to estimation techniques

Table A1 of the online appendix replicates the baseline results of
Table 3, ﬁrst, by controlling for the lagged dependent variable, and
second, by estimating the latter equation with a difference-GMM
estimator. The size of the point estimates on BBR decreases in both
speciﬁcations due to the downward bias introduced by the lagged
dependent variable (Keele and Kelly, 2006). However, the sign and
statistical signiﬁcance of all baseline results remain robust.

5.3.7. Robustness to alternative deﬁnitions of BBR and a wider set of
control variables

Table A2 of the online appendix presents additional tests of the
baseline results from Table 3 when: (a) including controls for the

occurrence of civil wars (columns 1–2)36; (b) using an alternative
deﬁnition of BBR (columns 3–4) that leads us to include four addi-
tional countries (see Table B1 of the online appendix for the sample
of countries having a BBR according to the baseline and alternative
deﬁnitions); and (c) including in the sample all country-year obser-
vations associated with constitutions that did not have a BBR and
that did not allow for any type of legislation related to the budget.37
The results from these tests are broadly consistent with our baseline
results.

36 Information on civil wars was taken from the Intra-state War data set (v.4.0) of
the Correlates of War project.
37 See our discussion about the substance of BBR in Section 4.1.

5.3.8. Selection on unobservables

Using the method proposed by Altonji et al. (2005), we con-
struct a measure that allows us to estimate how much stronger the
selection on unobservables has to be compared to the covariates
to explain away the treatment’s estimated effect (see also, Nunn
and Wantchekon, 2011; Oster, 2015; Baskaran, 2015; Hener et al.,
forthcoming). Table A4 of the online appendix reports the results
from this test and shows that after controlling for country and year
ﬁxed effects, the explanatory power of unobserved variables would
have to be thirty (four) times larger regarding government debt
(expenditure) for the effect of BBRs to be spurious.

5.3.9. The role of democratic institutions

We extend our baseline results by asking whether democratic
institutions are one of the mechanisms that translate the effect of
BBRs into ﬁscal outcomes. To test the hypothesis that the enforce-
ment of BBRs depends on well-functioning democratic institutions,
an interaction term between the BBR dummy and the Polity index of
democracy is included in the baseline speciﬁcation. Fig. 8 plots the
marginal effects. We do not ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant effect for
government debt. However, for government expenditures, BBRs only
reduce expenditures when democratic institutions are in place.

5.4. Effectiveness of non-constitutional ﬁscal rules

In this section, we extend the analysis and study the effectiveness
of national-level non-constitutional balanced budget rules. Non-
constitutional BBRs are a more recent phenomenon as compared to
constitutional ones. Most of these rules, particularly those in Europe,
were introduced starting in the beginning of 1990s following the
Maastricht Treaty, however others were introduced much earlier, for
example, by Japan in 1947, Malaysia in 1959, and Indonesia in 1967.
In 2015, the number of countries with non-constitutional BBRs in
effect peaked to 75 around the world.

We adopt our baseline difference-in-difference speciﬁcation as
in Tables 2 (columns 3–4)38 and 3 (columns 1–3) for crisis and
government ﬁnance variables, respectively. In Table 5, we then
estimate regressions on the effectiveness of constitutional and non-
constitutional BBRs, respectively, in even and odd numbered columns,
using the same speciﬁcation and the same sample. We do not ﬁnd
evidence that non-constitutional BBRs effectively constrain either the
probability of crisis or any of our three ﬁscal variables of interest.
In contrast, the substantial evidence on the effectiveness of con-
stitutional BBRs that we presented in the main results can be also
replicated here using the more limited sample for which data on
non-constitutional rules is available.39

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we estimate the reduced-form effects of constitu-
tional balanced budget rules (BBRs) on ﬁscal sustainability. Using
data from the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-ﬁrst centuries
for a large sample of countries, we ﬁnd that the introduction of
constitutional-level BBRs is, on average, associated with a seven-
teen percent reduction in the likelihood of experiencing a debt crisis
and an eleven percentage points decrease in the levels of govern-
ment debt-to-GDP ratio. We document that this reduction in debt
is achieved by decreasing expenditures rather than increasing tax
revenues. In contrast to these ﬁndings, we do not ﬁnd evidence

38 Adopting a speciﬁcation as in columns 1–2 of Table 2, that is not controlling for
debt-to-GDP, does not change the results.
39 Note that the statistical tests reported in the last row of Table 5 do not always
reject the null hypothesis that the estimated coeﬃcients of constitutional and non-
constitutional rules are not unequal.

Fig. 7. Trends in ﬁscal variables before the introduction of BBR.
Notes: Figures plot the yearly point estimates of the dynamic diff-in-diff design of the effect of BBR introduction in year t on share of government (a) debt, (b) expenditure and
(c) tax revenue in GDP measured in percentage points, and on (d) probability of crises. Each sub-ﬁgure represents one regression on post-1945 data. Outliers of the dependent
variables are trimmed at the top and bottom percentile of the distribution. All regressions control for log per capita GDP, log population, polity score of democracy, constitutional
change, country speciﬁc time trends, and include country, year, and continent times decade ﬁxed effects. Standard errors are clustered by country. F-test (p-value in parentheses)
of no anticipatory effects in leads by sub-ﬁgure (Granger, 1969): (a) 0.40 (0.8510); (b) 1.22 (0.3064); (c) 0.38 (0.8633); (d) 1.96 (0.0966).

that more popular non-constitutional BBRs have signiﬁcant average
effects on any of these ﬁscal outcomes.

These results may have important policy implications, espe-
cially for countries that suffer chronic ﬁscal deﬁcits and which
risk ﬁnding themselves on the verge of sovereign debt crises. Fis-
cal rules have been and continue to be a popular policy instru-
ment to solve the issue of persistent deﬁcits. However, as the 2008
global ﬁnancial crisis has shown, governments do not always com-
ply with national or supranational ﬁscal rules. As one solution to
this issue, the European Union – where the common-pool prob-
lems leading to large deﬁcits can perhaps be most saliently seen –
adopted the 2012 Fiscal Compact Treaty, which recommends Euro
area member states to enshrine BBRs into their national constitu-
tions. Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, and Spain, for example, have
passed structurally balanced budget rules, joining Switzerland and
Germany who had passed constitutional BBRs prior to 2012. Our
evidence of a robust and sizable effect of constitutional-level rules
on ﬁscal sustainability provides support for this ongoing agenda of
policy reform.

However, BBRs may have implications beyond ﬁscal sustainabil-
ity and it is important to understand the desirability of these fairly

rigid rules by also considering general equilibrium effects. This paper
is not informative about general welfare effects of BBRs, but a num-
ber of arguments brought up by related papers may be helpful when
thinking about such effects. First, BBRs may induce sub-optimal lev-
els of public investment and public goods provisions in the short-run,
and in theory, these effects may outweigh the long-run beneﬁts
of consolidation (see Azzimonti et al., 2016). On the other hand,
Alesina et al. (2002) suggest that some ﬁscal adjustments based
upon spending cuts may actually positively affect expectations and
stimulate the economy, for example, by removing the fear of future
harsher adjustments. Rule-based inﬂexible ﬁscal policy may also
reduce the desirability of BBRs if ﬁscal policy is especially effective
during recessions. In line with this logic, recent work shows that
reduced-form short-run estimates of ﬁscal multipliers may be larger
during recessions than in times of economic expansion (Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko, 2012). However, the size of the multiplier remains
subject of debate. A further argument against the desirability of BBRs
is that such rules may induce pro-cyclical ﬁscal policy (Clemens
and Miran, 2012). This concern is addressed by having structural
components in the rules, though the uncertainty with respect to
reliably forecasting the business cycle is likely to remain an obstacle.

Notes: The dependent variables are dummy for domestic or external debt crisis (in columns 1–2) and government debt, expenditure and tax revenue, and are measured as a
share of GDP in percentage points (in columns 3–8). The main independent variables of interest are dummies for the presence of constitutional and non-constitutional BBRs,
respectively, in even and odd numbered columns. Sample is ﬁxed to be the same in each of these pairs of regressions. The last row, Chi2 (Prob>chi2), tests for the equality of
these coeﬃcients. All regressions include country and year ﬁxed effects (not reported). Standard errors are clustered by country.

Given the wide set of issues that BBRs are intended to address, as
well as the different spillover and feedback effects that BBRs need to
take into account, the design of BBRs is likely to remain fairly com-
plicated and context-dependent. In this respect, we believe further
research could advance our understating of the effect of BBRs by pay-
ing more attention to both their design and the general environment
in which they operate.
