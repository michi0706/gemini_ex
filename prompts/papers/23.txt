A common belief held among researchers and policy makers is that regulatory reliance
has inﬂated market demand for credit ratings, despite their decreasing informational
value. Advances in information technology, coupled with reputation losses following the
subprime crisis, renew the question of whether investors still rely on ratings to assess
credit risk. Using Moody’s 2010 scale recalibration, which was unrelated to changing issuer
fundamentals, we ﬁnd that ratings still matter to investors and to issuers—apart from any
regulatory implications. Our results commend improved disclosure to mitigate mechanistic
reliance on ratings and inefﬁciencies due to rating standards that vary across asset classes.

The purpose of this paper is to test whether credit rating agencies (CRAs) remain
relevant as information intermediaries in the modern information environment.
There is a massive literature documenting correlation between credit ratings
and securities prices; however, these papers commonly suffer an endogeneity
problem.1 Speciﬁcally, it is difﬁcult to determine whether investors respond

directly to credit ratings, or if investors and CRAs merely observe and react to
the same information about issuer fundamentals.2

Kliger and Sarig (2000) address this problem by showing that markets reacted
when Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) added modiﬁers to its ratings scale
in 1982. Much has changed since 1982. The speed and cost of information
processing have exponentially increased and decreased, respectively, because
of advancements in information technology and the advent of the internet. These
developments have likely resulted in at least some investors who previously
relied on CRAs to begin performing their own credit risk analyses. Even the less
ambitious investors now have alternative sources of information—including
market prices of credit default swaps (CDS)—that were not available in 1982.
Further, both Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s (S&P) suffered signiﬁcant loss
of reputation capital as a result of the inaccurate ratings they produced in the
run-up to the recent ﬁnancial crisis. Although the ratings most relevant during
the ﬁnancial crisis were those of structured ﬁnance products, some question
CRA viability more broadly. For example, during a post-crisis congressional
hearing, Congressman Christopher Shays argued, “They have no brand, they
have no credibility whatsoever. I can’t imagine any investor trusting them.”3
For these reasons, we revisit the question of whether credit rating agencies still
matter.

There are several more recent papers (reviewed in Section 1) indicating that
credit ratings continue to have real economic effects. However, the evidence in
these papers suggests that ratings now matter primarily (if not exclusively) due
to their regulatory implications. Because ratings affect investment standards
and capital requirements, they affect the value of securities to institutional
investors, even if these investors do not rely on ratings to evaluate credit risk. The
regulatory implications of ratings are particularly acute in markets dominated
by regulated investors, including the more commonly studied corporate bond
market. The unanswered research question we tackle here is whether investors
continue to rely on credit ratings for information about credit risk, apart from
the confounding effects of ratings’ regulatory implications. We ﬁnd robust
evidence that they do.

We examine the impact of Moody’s recalibration of its municipal bond
(muni) rating scale in the spring of 2010, after the dust of the recent ﬁnancial
crisis had settled. Historically, the criteria Moody’s used to assign municipal

and Warga (1997), Ederington and Goh (1998), Dichev and Piotroski (2001), Alp (2013), and Cornaggia and
Cornaggia (2013).

2 Liu and Thakor (1984, 345) are the ﬁrst to recognize this problem: “Unfortunately, few ‘clean’ empirical tests
have been performed. The problem is obvious. A state bond’s yield is likely to depend on its rating as well as the
state’s economic characteristics. But the rating itself is related to these characteristics” More recently, regarding
mortgage-backed securities’ ratings, Ashcraft et al. (2011, 116) explain, “The main empirical challenge to be
overcome is identifying the causal effect of ratings on security prices, holding security fundamentals ﬁxed.”

The Review of Financial Studies / v 31 n 6 2018

bond ratings was based on how likely the municipality was to require ﬁnancial
support from higher levels of government. These criteria were unique to
municipal bonds; bonds in all other asset classes are rated according to their
expected losses. When Moody’s recalibrated its ratings for municipal debt, it
applied the expected loss criteria it uses for all other asset classes. This change in
criteria resulted in upgrades of zero to four notches on $2.2 trillion of municipal
debt. Importantly, Moody’s designed the recalibration to be uncorrelated with
changes in issuer fundamentals. By changing the criteria, Moody’s provided a
new perspective on the bonds’ credit risk, but the fundamentals of the bonds
did not change. This event allows us to overcome the endogeneity challenge
faced by most prior studies.

Unlike the corporate bond market studied previously, the muni market is
dominated by unregulated retail investors.4 By focusing on retail trades in the
muni market, we avoid confounding regulatory effects. Because our setting
involves rating changes that do not result from changes in fundamentals, and
because the transactions in our sample are not executed by regulated investors,
we are able to cleanly identify investor reliance on ratings to assess credit risk.
An important feature of the recalibration is that not all munis were upgraded.
Municipal issuers that were already “well calibrated” to the global scale for
other asset classes serve as our control group in a difference-in-differences
framework. These bonds provide reasonable benchmarks for how the prices on
upgraded bonds would have behaved in the absence of Moody’s recalibration.
Because credit ratings on insured bonds reﬂect the credit quality of the insurer,
we include only uninsured bonds in our analyses. (Roughly 60% of the
$2.2 trillion sample munis are uninsured.) Our sample consists of roughly
equally-sized treatment and control groups: $640 billion of uninsured munis
experienced upgrades due to recalibration, and $601 billion did not.

We ﬁnd robust evidence that investors reacted to this event. Controlling for
bond characteristics and a host of ﬁxed effects, we ﬁnd that upgraded bonds
experience a decrease in credit spreads of 19 to 33 basis points (bp) relative
to non-upgraded bonds. This is the main result in the paper. This reliance
is economically meaningful, and our results are robust to a wide variety of
alternative speciﬁcations.

Although the municipal bond market is a natural setting to test whether
investors rely on ratings to assess risk, we take seriously the possibility that
our results could still reﬂect some regulation-based demand. Although our
secondary market results focus exclusively on retail-size trades, we impose as
a robustness check an additional ﬁlter that removes retail transactions for issues
with any level of holdings by insurance companies facing ratings-based capital
charges. Results and conclusions are unchanged.

4 In 2010, households held $1.87 trillion of the $3.77 trillion municipal debt market. Mutual funds are a distant
second, holding 14%, followed by money market funds (10%), property-casualty insurance companies (9%),
and U.S.-chartered depository institutions (7%) (www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1.pdf).

Credit Ratings and the Cost of Municipal Financing

We make use of various institutional features to further test for regulation-
based demand. For example, most ratings-based regulations distinguish
between broad rating categories rather than individual notches within those
categories. We exploit this feature by comparing results among bonds with
equal-sized upgrades that do and do not cross into new broad rating categories.
These tests provide at most limited evidence of regulation-based demand.
Some regulations also use a “lowest rating binds” criterion, which employs
the lower of Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) ratings. We exploit this
feature by comparing the impact of the recalibration among upgraded bonds
with ratings from S&P that remain, versus become, lower than ratings from
Moody’s. If the rating from S&P was lower than the rating from Moody’s
before the recalibration and remained lower after Moody’s upgrades, then the
recalibration should have no regulatory bite. However, if the Moody’s rating
leapfrogged the S&P rating (and thus the S&P rating becomes the lower rating),
then this upgrade should have regulatory implications. However, we ﬁnd no
differential impact of the recalibration on these two groups of upgraded bonds.
Overall, the cross-sectional analysis of upgrades based on their likely regulatory
effects provides corroborating evidence that investors’ reaction to Moody’s
recalibration reﬂects primarily a reliance on ratings to price risk rather than an
increase in regulation-based demand.

We explore several other alternative explanations for our results. For
example, Harris and Piwowar (2006) show that municipal bond liquidity
increases with credit quality. If investor perception of bonds’ credit quality
increases when ratings are upgraded, then the price changes we observe could
reﬂect lower liquidity premiums. A consequence of this hypothesis is that
upgraded bonds should experience permanent increases in liquidity. This is not
what we ﬁnd. Although upgraded bonds’ trading volume increases immediately
after the recalibration relative to non-upgraded bonds, this increase is transitory.
We ﬁnd that upgraded bonds’ trading volume in the period three to six months
after the recalibration is statistically indistinguishable from that prior to the
recalibration. This ﬁnding indicates that upgraded bonds do not experience
permanent increases in liquidity, despite their permanently higher ratings.

Another possible explanation for our results is that the control group, the
non-upgraded bonds, coincidentally experienced a decrease in returns around
the time of the recalibration. If this is true, then our results could still obtain
even if the market did not bid up the prices of the upgraded bonds. We ﬁnd
no evidence of this effect. If anything, the returns of the non-upgraded group
are slightly higher (although not signiﬁcantly so) around the recalibration in
comparison to their own returns in a 180-day period preceding the recalibration.
Next, we examine the possibility that our results could reﬂect shifts in
demand for particular levels of governments’ bonds around the recalibration.
For example, state-level issuers received some of the largest upgrades. If
investors happened to experience an increase in demand for state-level (as
opposed to county, city, or other levels of government) bonds around the time

of the recalibration, then our results could reﬂect that demand shift instead of a
response to the rating changes. We address this possibility by including in our
regressions issuer-level-of-government ﬁxed effects that vary before and after
the recalibration. Our results are fully robust.

Finally, we consider the possibility that our results could reﬂect differential
changes in the fundamentals of the upgraded and non-upgraded groups.
Moody’s (2010) states that the recalibration does not reﬂect changes in credit
risk and that any ratings under review prior to the recalibration remained under
review. Still, we address this potential concern by comparing S&P’s ratings to
Moody’s ratings around the time of the recalibration. If the recalibration did
indeed reﬂect changes in fundamentals, then we should observe S&P eventually
change its ratings in a pattern similar to Moody’s. We start by constructing
ratings transition matrices for bonds rated by both Moody’s and S&P around
the recalibration. We ﬁnd little similarity in the shape of S&P’s and Moody’s
transition matrices. We also examine a time series of the two raters’ average
muni ratings. We observe a sharp increase in Moody’s ratings relative to S&P
in 2010 that remains fully intact through the end of our data availability.
Overall, although we cannot disprove the possibility that the upgraded and
non-upgraded bonds’ fundamentals were changing differently around the time
of the recalibration, we ﬁnd no evidence to support this possibility.

We turn next to the primary market to test whether market reliance on ratings
has real economic effects. We conduct this analysis at the issuer level, sorting
issuers by whether their outstanding bonds were upgraded as a result of Moody’s
recalibration. Using a multivariate difference-in-differences approach, we ﬁnd
that spreads on new issues by upgraded issuers decrease by 15 to 22 bp,
relative to the control group. This magnitude is comparable to what we ﬁnd
in the secondary market, and it indicates that our ﬁndings are economically
meaningful. The product of $640 billion (the face value of uninsured municipal
debt upgraded during recalibration) and 15 bp (our most conservative estimate
of the recalibration effect on offer yields) is $960 million. This back-of-the-
envelope calculation provides an estimate of aggregate excess interest paid
annually (in 2010 dollars) by U.S. taxpayers due to Moody’s previous dual-
class rating system. We also observe that upgraded issuers see a larger increase
in issuance volume than non-upgraded issuers in the years following the
recalibration. This ﬁnding demonstrates that ratings have real economic effects;
lower borrowing costs increase municipal borrowing (and presumably increase
municipal investment).5

We extend our primary market analysis to test whether investors rely more
heavily on credit ratings when the amount and quality of alternative sources of
information are low. For example, we employ the issuer level of government as
a proxy for issuer size and opacity. Consistent with an information effect, we

5 Adelino, Cunha, and Ferriera (Forthcoming) document an increase in government employment along with other

real effects of this shock to the supply of municipal credit.

ﬁnd the results of the recalibration are weakest among state-level issuers and
strongest among cities. The recalibration effect is also stronger among issuers
in states with more opaque accounting practices, in states identiﬁed as more
corrupt, and among municipalities without ratings from S&P. Combined, these
additional results indicate that ratings are more inﬂuential when investors have
less alternative information.

Overall, our contribution to the literature is original evidence that investors
rely on credit ratings to assess risk, and that this reliance is greatest among
opaque issuers for which investors lack alternative sources of information. Our
results bring new evidence to bear regarding the classic question of whether
and how security prices depend on credit ratings. The results also shed light
on how investors process information in the municipal bond market, a multi-
trillion-dollar market that is relatively opaque and is beginning to receive greater
attention from researchers.

1. Institutional Background and Literature Review

1.1 Moody’s dual class ratings
Moody’s uses its Global Scale when rating corporate bonds, sovereign debt, and
structured ﬁnance products. These bonds are rated according to their expected
losses. Expected loss is the product of probability of default and loss given
default. Historically, Moody’s rated municipal bonds according to separate
criteria. Moody’s assigned municipal ratings based on how likely a municipality
is to require extraordinary support from a higher level of government in order
to avoid default; Moody’s (2007, 2). This changed in the spring of 2010, when
Moody’s recalibrated its municipal bond rating criteria to match that of the
Global Scale.

Moody’s (2010, 1) clariﬁes that the recalibration is intended to enhance the
comparability of ratings across asset classes, not to indicate a change in credit
quality:

Our benchmarking ... will result in an upward shift for most state and
local government long-term municipal ratings by up to three notches. The
degree of movement will be less for some sectors ... which are largely already
aligned with ratings on the global scale. Market participants should not view
the recalibration of municipal ratings as ratings upgrades, but rather as a
recalibration of the ratings to a different scale. ... [The recalibration] does
not reﬂect an improvement in credit quality or a change in our opinion.

Importantly for our study, Moody’s (2010) indicates that any ratings under
review for upgrade or downgrade prior to recalibration would remain under
review—not lumped into these massive ratings changes. As such, our sample
does not include any natural upgrades associated with improving issuer
fundamentals that would contaminate the estimates generated by our tests.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 31 n 6 2018

The timeline of Moody’s recalibration is as follows. In 2008, Moody’s
revealed its intention to recalibrate its municipal bond rating scale.6 This
announcement, however, contained no information regarding which bonds’
ratings would change or by how much. On March 16, 2010, Moody’s
announced the particulars of the recalibration. On this date, Moody’s published
a white paper containing its Primary Algorithm. The Primary Algorithm
indicated which bonds’ ratings would be upgraded and by how much. The two
characteristics that Moody’s used to recalibrate muni ratings were preexisting
ratings and sectors. Moody’s categorizes bonds into four sectors. Figure A.1
in the Internet Appendix reproduces the Primary Algorithm. The actual
recalibration was enacted on four dates. The ﬁrst recalibration date was April
16, 2010, one month after the publication of the Primary Algorithm. The second,
third, and fourth recalibration dates were April 23, May 1, and May 7, 2010,
respectively. We provide details in Section 2 on the number and par values of
bonds that were upgraded (and not upgraded) on each date.

We test whether the market reacted to this event. If the market does not rely
on Moody’s ratings to assess risk, then we should see no reaction. However,
the change in criteria applied by Moody’s potentially allows the market to learn
new information about the bonds. Consider the following analogy. Imagine a
student who earns a B on a mostly qualitative exam. If the student soon after
earns an A on a mostly quantitative exam in the same class, then the professor
will update her opinion on the student’s aptitude. Yet the student’s aptitude
does not change from one exam to the next. What changes are the criteria
used to evaluate aptitude. In the same way, the market might react to Moody’s
recalibration even though the bonds’ fundamentals do not change around the
time of the recalibration. What changes are the criteria used to evaluate credit
risk. Credit risk is not one-dimensional. If we ﬁnd a response to the recalibration,
then we can infer that investors updated their views about the bonds’ credit risk
after Moody’s evaluated the bonds under the new criteria. Just as the professor
takes a more favorable view of the student’s aptitude when using criteria that
reward quantitative ability, the market might change its view of munis when
Moody’s uses criteria based on expected losses.

1.2 Credit ratings and ﬁnancial regulation
Financial regulators have historically relied on credit ratings to establish capital
requirements and prudent investment guidelines. This regulatory reliance on
ratings dates to at least a ruling by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency in 1931.
Under Rule 5b-3 of the Investment Company Act, the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) treated Aaa-rated bonds as equivalent to
Treasuries. Pension fund investment guidelines established by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and bank capital requirements

established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have likewise been
ratings-based. Under the Standardized Approach in Basel II, single A-rated
munis carry a higher charge (20% risk weight) than Aa- or Aaa-rated munis
(0% risk weight).7 Capital charges established by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) range from 3.39% to 19.5% for speculative
grade (SG) bonds compared with 0.30% to 0.96% for investment grade (IG)
bonds. This body of regulation creates incentives for regulated investors to
respond to ratings, irrespective of whether they rely on ratings to evaluate risk.
Indeed, the state of the credit ratings literature suggests that ratings matter
primarily due to their regulatory implications. For example, Ellul, Jotikasthira,
and Lundblad (2011) document ﬁre sales by insurance companies when
bonds in their portfolios are downgraded from IG to SG. The liquidity
premiums associated with these sales indicate that the sales were attributable to
capital charges rather than any information communicated by the downgrade.
Becker and Ivashina (2015) further document regulatory arbitrage by insurance
companies chasing yield in a ratings-based regulatory environment. Because
the NAIC sets capital charges based on ratings, savvy insurance companies
circumvent their regulatory capital charges by over-allocating capital to the
bonds with the highest credit risk within a particular credit rating category.
Stanton and Wallace (2013) similarly conclude that overinvestment in high-
risk commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) is attributable to such
regulatory arbitrage in a ratings-based environment, and Cornaggia, Cornaggia,
and Hund (2017) simulate potential regulatory arbitrage among banks subject
to Basel II capital requirements. Opp, Opp, and Harris (2013) provide a
formal model and conclude that regulatory implications of ratings are of
ﬁrst-order concern for marginal investors. In addition to ofﬁcial regulation,
Chen et al. (2014) document the reliance on credit ratings in private investment
mandates, asset management policies, and informal procedures that employ
ratings to restrict holdings by mutual funds and investment advisors. Perhaps
Ekins and Calabria (2012, 1) summarize the evolution of CRA relevance
most succinctly in their conclusion: “Government regulatory use of credit
ratings inﬂated the market demand for NRSRO ratings, despite the decreasing
informational value of credit ratings.”8

Because of the regulation-based demand for ratings, recent studies that
document market reaction to ratings changes or other real economic effects
(e.g., Kisgen 2012; Almeida et al. 2017; and Begley 2015) cannot conclude
that investors rely on ratings for information. Results from these studies may
instead reﬂect changes in regulatory compliance costs. In fact, Almeida et al.
(2017) speciﬁcally focus on ratings-based Basel II capital requirements in their
study of the real effects of sovereign debt downgrades.

7 See paragraphs 53 and 58 of the Basel Capital Standards, available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs128.pdf.
8 The SEC certiﬁes certain credit rating agencies whose ratings are useful for regulatory compliance as Nationally

Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs).

The Review of Financial Studies / v 31 n 6 2018

One beneﬁt of our setting is that the retail investors who dominate the muni
market are subject to none of the aforementioned regulations. Any reaction
among retail investors must therefore reﬂect an information effect. We are the
ﬁrst, to our knowledge, to directly test the extent to which market participants
rely on ratings to assess credit risk apart from their need to manage regulatory
capital charges and comply with other ratings-based regulations.

1.3 Modern relevance of CRAs as information intermediaries
It is not obvious that modern investors rely on credit ratings to assess risk. For
one thing, ratings are too coarse to fully reﬂect differences in credit quality
across all rated securities; see Goel and Thakor (2015). Second, traditional
ratings are designed to be stable over time and not to reﬂect real-time changes
in credit quality (Moody’s 2006). Third, the conﬂicts of interest in the issuer-
pays CRA compensation structure are well known.9 Fourth, improvements
in information technology provide investors more-granular and more-timely
credit risk metrics than traditional credit ratings (e.g., Cornaggia and Cornaggia
2013). Finally, the CRAs lost signiﬁcant reputation capital due to their role in
the subprime crisis.

Finally, although Kliger and Sarig (2000) demonstrate a causal impact of
ratings on security prices, these authors use an event from 1982. In 1982,
investors lacked internet access, paid for long-distance telephone service, and
received hard copies of Moody’s investment manuals in the mail. As such, it is
unclear whether traditional CRAs matter as much as they did in 1982. We are
the ﬁrst, to our knowledge, to disentangle both the regulatory and endogeneity
problems faced by existing literature in the modern information era.

1.4 Muni market information environment
Another novel feature of our paper is the ability to exploit cross-sectional
variation in the quality of information available to investors in municipal bonds.
Other papers focus primarily on corporate securities that trade in relatively
liquid, transparent markets and therefore may not be generalized to markets
with less transparent issuers. Although the municipal ﬁnance market is large
($3.77 trillion in March 2014), this market is opaque and decentralized. Unlike
corporations, state and local governments are not subject to the registration
and reporting requirements of the SEC. Therefore, ﬁnancial disclosure by
municipalities is often less reliable, less comparable, and less timely than
information released by corporations; however, the information quality varies
widely across municipal issuers (see Ingram, Brooks, and Copeland 1983;
Gore 2004; and Cuny 2016). This cross-sectional variation in the information

environment across muni markets allows for additional tests of investor reliance
on ratings to assess credit risk.

2. Data Collection and Sample Description

2.1 The recalibration event
Our data consist of ratings from Moody’s and S&P, bond market transaction
prices and volume from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB),
and issue/issuer characteristics from Ipreo. From Moody’s, we collect ratings
data on every bond issue by a state or local government that had a “Change
in Scale” rating action on April 16, April 23, May 1, or May 7 in 2010, as
well as the ratings on all past and future issues by the same issuers. Because
market perception of insured bonds reﬂects the credit quality of the monolines,
we focus on uninsured bonds in our empirical analyses. Table 1 presents the
number of issues and cumulative par value of recalibrated investment-grade
munis.10 Panel A contains all bonds with a “Change in Scale” rating action.
Panel B contains the uninsured bonds from which we draw our sample.

The recalibration event of 2010 followed the monolines’ loss of their Aaa
ratings in June 2008.11 We thus consider the extent to which the composition of

10 Less than 1% of “Change in Scale” actions were associated with bonds that had speculative grade ratings, and
none of these actions resulted in an upgrade. We discard these bonds for ease of presentation of the transition
matrices and other results reported by rating. Including these observations does not alter any of our results.

11 S&P downgraded MBIA, Inc., and Ambac Financial Group, Inc., two notches to AA on June 6, 2008.
Moody’s downgraded MBIA (Ambac) ﬁve (three) notches to A2 (Aa3) on June 19, 2008; Reuter’s
(http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/06/05/bonds-insurers-sandp-idUSN0519442220080605) and Dow Jones

This table displays migration matrices on underlying ratings for municipal bonds for which Moody’s issued a
“Change in Scale” rating action. Panel A includes all bonds rated by Moody’s. Panel B restricts the sample in
Panel A to uninsured bonds. The horizontal axis represents bonds’ ratings before the ﬁrst recalibration date (April
16, 2010), and the vertical axis represents the bonds’ ratings after the fourth and ﬁnal recalibration date (May 7,
2010). We collect ratings data on bonds issued by state or local governments from Moody’s.

the muni market (insured versus uninsured issues) may have changed around the
time of the recalibration. We ﬁnd that the resulting change in the proportion of
insured/uninsured munis occurred more than two years prior to the recalibration
event. We report this evidence in the Internet Appendix; see Figure A.1.

In March 2010, Moody’s Primary Algorithm advertised a zero- to three-
notch upgrade associated with the recalibration. Table 2 reports the actual
migration matrix. As in Table 1, Panel A contains all bonds and Panel B contains
only the uninsured bonds from which we draw our sample. The proportion of
bonds upgraded varies by initial rating. Other than Aaa-rated bonds, which by
deﬁnition cannot upgrade, no initial rating level retained more than 50% of
its original bonds. Among uninsured bonds, 54% rated Aa1 upgraded to Aaa.
No other bonds reached the Aaa level. Approximately 57% of bonds originally
in the A categories migrated into Aa categories, and 64% of bonds in Baa
categories migrated into the A range. Only 11 bonds were upgraded more than
three notches (from A3 to Aa2). For the 9,714 issuers with multiple bonds
outstanding at the time of recalibration, we examine (but do not tabulate) the
within-issuer ratings distributions before and after the recalibration and ﬁnd
that these distributions remain largely intact.12

12 The within-issuer standard deviation of bond ratings averages 0.202 notches (0.206 notches) prior to (following)
recalibration. The similarity of these standard deviations indicates that Moody’s did not, for example, upgrade

This table displays summary statistics on the rating actions (upgrades, downgrades, or afﬁrmations) subsequent
to recalibration for uninsured municipal bonds. A bond’s rating must update again after a “Change in Scale”
rating action for inclusion in this table. We report the difference in the new rating and the rating produced by the
recalibration, measured in notches. A positive (negative) difference indicates a subsequent upgrade (downgrade).
Zero difference indicates that the recalibrated rating was subsequently afﬁrmed. The sample ends in October
2012. We translate Moody’s 21-point alphanumeric scale into a numeric scale such that Aaa = 21, Aa1 = 20, ...,
C = 1. We collect ratings data on bonds issued by state or local governments from Moody’s.

In Table 3, we track post-recalibration rating actions (upgrades, downgrades,
or afﬁrmations) for uninsured bonds through the ﬁrst year after recalibration
and, for completeness, through the end of our data collection. The summary
statistics in this table shed light on the permanence of Moody’s recalibration.
Recalibrated bonds in our sample are subsequently upgraded (downgraded)
at most two (three) notches in the year following recalibration. The average
recalibrated bond is downgraded 0.019 notches in the subsequent year. We see
some evidence that bonds with larger upgrades during recalibration experience
larger subsequent downgrades. Among the bonds upgraded three notches, the
average recalibrated bond is downgraded 0.113 notches in the subsequent year.
Because the vast majority of recalibrated bonds had no subsequent rating action
(and thus do not appear in Table 3), the majority of subsequent rating actions
are afﬁrmations, and the magnitudes of any downgrades are small relative to
the preceding upgrades due to recalibration, we conclude that the recalibration
event was permanent.

We further examine the permanence of Moody’s recalibration by testing
whether new bonds issued after recalibration have the same, higher ratings
generated by the recalibration.13 Of upgraded municipalities that issue bonds
in both the year before and the year after their recalibrations, the average rating

the lowest- or highest-rated bonds for each municipality. Rather, it indicates Moody’s generally shifted upward
the entire distribution of ratings for each issuer.

13 We numerically transform Moody’s rating scale ascending in credit quality (Aaa = 21, Aa1 = 20, … , C = 1).

on their outstanding bonds changed from 17.8 (≈Aa3) to 19.2 (≈Aa2) as a
result of the recalibration. The standard deviation of these ratings declined
from 1.4 notches to 1.1 notches. These numbers appear in Table A.4 in
the Internet Appendix. Importantly, the ratings on new bonds (issued in the
year after recalibration) exhibit a similar average (19.1 ≈ Aa2) and standard
deviation (1.9 notches) as the recalibrated bonds. We thus conclude that
Moody’s applied its recalibrated ratings standards to new issues going forward
after the recalibration, not just to bonds outstanding at that time.

2.2 Secondary market data
We examine bond returns and trading volume in secondary markets around
recalibration. We gather secondary market trading data from the MSRB
Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) database. The MSRB reports
all trades of municipal bonds in the EMMA database, excluding both reversals
and cancellations from historical data. The transaction data include prices,
dollar volume, trade time, and whether the transaction was “Customer bought,”
“Customer sold,” or “Inter-dealer trade.” The database does not distinguish
between retail and institutional customers. In order to focus on retail investors,
we restrict the sample based on trade size. Following Dick-Nielsen, Feldhutter,
and Lando (2012), we attribute trade sizes less than or equal to $100,000 to retail
investors. (All results are robust to an alternative $50,000 cutoff.) Because retail
investors dominate the muni market, this restriction reduces the sample size by
only 30%. For transactions involving a “Customer,” the yield is also reported.
The reported yield is the lower of the yield-to-call and the yield-to-maturity.
Municipal bond dealers include discount brokerages, full service brokerages,
municipal advisers, and investment banks.14 Finally, we measure the percentage
of each bond’s principal held by insurance companies at the time of Moody’s
recalibration using Annual Fraternal, Life, Property, Separate Accounts, and
Title & Health Data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC).

2.3 New issues data
We gather data on new issues from the Ipreo i-Deal database including offer
yield, sale date, maturity date, par value, coupon rate, as well as information on
insurance and other support. For the same reason we exclude insured bonds
in tests that use secondary market data, we exclude new issues that carry
insurance in our tests based on primary market data. Panel B of Figure A.2
(Internet Appendix) displays the dollar volume of insured and uninsured
municipal bond issues by month from April 2009 to April 2011. We focus
on this time period for two reasons. First, our multivariate regressions, which
we explain below, use data from this time period. Second, it spans the Build

America Bonds (BAB) program, which ran from April 2009 to December
2010.15. Uninsured bonds dominate this market over this time period.

2.4 Matching treasury securities
We measure credit spreads in several ways for completeness. We calculate
spreads by subtracting duration-matched Treasury yields.16 For robustness, we
calculate duration two ways. We estimate Spread to Treasury1 with duration
calculated using each bond’s time to maturity, regardless of whether the bond
is callable. We estimate Spread to Treasury2 with duration calculated by
substituting the callable bonds’ call dates in lieu of their maturity dates.

Because munis are generally tax exempt, we also examine after-tax spreads.
Spread to after-tax Treasury1 (Spread to after-tax Treasury2) is similar to Spread
to Treasury1 (Spread to Treasury2) except we use an after-tax yield on the
duration-matched Treasury security. Because BABs are generally taxable, we
employ after-tax yields of BABs (rather than raw yields) for both after-tax
spread variables. We assume a marginal tax rate of 35%.

3. Empirical Results

3.1 Price impact of ratings recalibration
We begin by studying the secondary market return behavior for outstanding
munis. This analysis allows us to focus on a narrow window around recalibration
dates, which should limit the inﬂuence of other contemporaneous events.17
We estimate market impact in two ways. First, for each recalibration date,
we calculate CARs from 60 trading days prior to the recalibration date to 60
trading days after, using our control group (i.e., zero-notch “Change in Scale”
upgrades) as the benchmark. Second, we examine changes in secondary market
yields (and credit spreads), controlling for a host of issue characteristics in a
multivariate difference-in-differences regression framework. We supplement
this second set of tests with placebo analyses that use alternative event dates.
We employ all observations for which we have sufﬁcient data in each analysis.
Details on sample construction and number of observations employed in each
ﬁgure and table are available in the Internet Appendix (Table A.1).

15 See http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/22/news/economy/build_america_bonds/.
16 All results are robust to matching Treasuries based on maturity rather than duration. We match by duration
because munis often have partial amortization or call provisions that reduce the effective maturity. We compute
benchmark Treasury yields as follows. First, we gather STRIPS data from Bloomberg. We keep coupon STRIPS
and discard principal STRIPS, because unlike coupon STRIPS, which derive their prices from a wide range of
securities, principal STRIPS are identiﬁed with a single security (and thus may be inﬂuenced by idiosyncratic
factors such as premiums for cheapest-to-deliver bonds). For each sample bond, we select the two STRIPS with
the closest durations (one above and one below) and linearly interpolate to determine the benchmark. Because
these zero-coupon yields are determined by no-arbitrage conditions, they can be directly observed and are not
model-speciﬁc.

17 Illiquidity in ﬁxed income markets typically complicates abnormal bond return calculations. However, during
April and May of 2010, more than $300 billion of munis changed hands in more than one million transactions.

Figure 1
Cumulative abnormal returns around recalibration dates
This ﬁgure displays cumulative abnormal returns of outstanding, uninsured municipal bonds with ratings
recalibrated by Moody’s. We include only bonds purchased by customers (as opposed to dealers) on at least
six days during 120-day trading windows centered on the bonds’ recalibration dates. Panel A (B, C, D) shows
cumulative abnormal returns for bonds recalibrated on April 16 (April 23, May 1, May 7), 2010. In each panel,
the solid vertical bar indicates March 16, 2010, the day the recalibration was announced, and the dashed vertical
bar indicates the respective implementation date. We split the bonds by the size of the upgrade (one, two, or
three notches). The comparison group in each panel consists of municipal bonds that were recalibrated on the
indicated recalibration date, but not upgraded (i.e., the zero-notch group). Dotted lines represent 95% conﬁdence
intervals. We gather secondary market trading data from the MSRB Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA)
database.

3.1.1 CARs.
In Figure 1, we plot CARs for portfolios of upgraded bonds
with 95% conﬁdence intervals around each recalibration date. April 16 is the
cleanest event of the four, as there is no overlap with the other three dates until
trading day +5. This date also features the most upgrades of the four, giving the
tests the most power. We calculate returns by trade-weighting as described by
Bessembinder et al. (2009).18 In particular, we calculate the daily price, Pt , as:

Pt =

N(cid:2)

i=1

(cid:3)N

tradesize
j=1tradesizej

pricei

(1)

18 Using corporate bond trading data, these authors show that calculating abnormal returns using trade-weighted

prices increases the power of the test and reduces Type 1 errors relative to using end-of-day prices.

(2)

We form equal-weighted portfolios for zero-, one-, two-, and three-notch
upgrades and calculate cumulative returns over the 120-trading-day window
for each portfolio. We then calculate CARs for each upgraded portfolio by
subtracting the zero-notch portfolio’s cumulative return.

We observe signiﬁcant positive CARs in Figure 1 for portfolios of upgraded
bonds for each of the ﬁrst three recalibration dates. In each panel, post-
recalibration CARs are around 50 bp for munis upgraded one notch. This effect
generally increases in the magnitude of the recalibration, with larger CARs for
munis upgraded two or three notches. Only the fourth and ﬁnal recalibration
date shows no signiﬁcant effect. This non-result is not surprising, given that
most of the rating recalibrations on the fourth date were zero-notch changes,
as shown in Table 1. Relative to the earlier three dates, only a small percentage
of bonds received upgrades, thus limiting the power of the test.

Figure 1 also reveals abnormal returns between the release of the Primary
Algorithm and the ﬁrst recalibration date. The goal of our paper is to establish
whether investors rely on ratings to assess credit risk. The abnormal returns
preceding the ﬁrst recalibration date shed some light on the reasons why they
might do so. Because CRAs are exempt from Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD),
it is possible that credit ratings contain nonpublic information. However, even if
CRAs merely compile public information, it may be rational for investors to rely
on ratings—depending on the costs associated with analyzing this information.
Figure 1 suggests that at least some portion of investor reliance reﬂects the
costs associated with credit analysis.

Finally, we consider that the drift in returns following the recalibration dates
in Figure 1 may reﬂect illiquidity since these are averages across bonds and
many do not trade on a given day. To focus more precisely on trades around
the recalibrations, we perform univariate tests after calculating bond returns
using the change in price from the last trade in the 30 days before Moody’s
published the Primary Algorithm to the ﬁrst trade in the 30 days after the
bonds’ ratings change. (Results are robust to using the ﬁrst trade on or after
the recalibration dates.) As in Figure 1, we sort recalibrated bonds into equal-
weighted portfolios based on upgrade magnitude. We then compare the average
return to the portfolios of upgraded bonds to the control group (the portfolio
of zero-notch upgrades). We perform this analysis across each of the four
recalibration dates. As in Figure 1, we observe signiﬁcant increases in returns of
upgraded bonds relative to non-upgraded bonds for the ﬁrst three recalibration
dates.19 We do not tabulate these results to conserve space.

19 These results are further robust to controlling for the length of time prior to and following the recalibration dates
that the bonds trade. For example, the return for a bond that trades on days immediately before Moody’s published

3.1.2 Multivariate regressions. We expand our analysis of credit rating
price impact to a multivariate difference-in-differences setting in Table 4. This
approach provides a more rigorous test of the patterns observed in Figure 1.
These ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions employ yields and credit
spreads as dependent variables, averaged across transactions by bond during
either the 30 days before Moody’s published the Primary Algorithm or the 30
days after the bond’s rating was recalibrated. We include in the regressions
uninsured bonds with trading in both periods. We omit data in the intermediate
period between when Moody’s published the Primary Algorithm and when the
bonds’ ratings were actually recalibrated, inclusive of the rating change dates.
Graphically, we deﬁne the pre- and post-event periods for the four recalibration
dates as seen in Figure 2. This approach allows us to sidestep the issue of whether
investors responded to the publication of the Primary Algorithm versus the
actual rating changes. Moody’s white papers (such as the publication containing
the Primary Algorithm) are obscure sources of information for most retail
investors. Investors may not know when Moody’s publishes a white paper,
let alone digest it promptly upon release. They may only become aware of
rating changes after they actually take place. Either way, omitting data from the
intermediate period allows a clean comparison of prices before the recalibration
was detailed to after it took effect.

In Table 4, Raw yield is the lower of the yield-to-call and the yield-to-
maturity. Each of the credit spread variables is deﬁned in Section 2.4. Panel
A captures the effect of recalibration on bond yields and credit spreads with
Upgrade, an indicator variable taking a value of one if the issuer of the bond
experienced an upgrade on any of its outstanding bonds during any of the
recalibration events and zero if the issuer’s bonds experienced only zero-notch

the Primary Algorithm and immediately after its rating changes reﬂects fewer general, systematic changes in the
muni market than a bond that trades on days 30 days before Moody’s published the Primary Algorithm and 30
days after its rating changes. We address this concern by replicating the analysis after adjusting bond returns by
a municipal bond index. Speciﬁcally, we subtract from the return of each bond the return on the S&P Municipal
Bond Index over the same time horizon. For example, we subtract the index return from day −1 to +1 (−30 to
+30) for bonds that trade on days –1 and +1 (−30 and +30). We then test for differences in these adjusted returns
among upgraded versus non-upgraded bonds. The results do not change.

“Change in Scale” upgrades. Post recalibration is an indicator variable taking a
value of one if the observation is from the 30 days after the bond’s recalibration
date. This variable takes a value of zero if the observation is from the 30 days
prior to the publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm.

We control for issue characteristics including par value, duration, coupon
rate, and dummy variables indicating whether the issues are callable, BABs,
issued through a negotiated process, and whether the bonds are General
Obligation (GO) or revenue bonds. We deﬁne all variables and report summary
statistics in the Internet Appendix (Table A.2). Issue rating pre-recalibration FE

This table displays OLS regression results with various measures of secondary market yields and spreads as
the dependent variable. The dependent variables appear at the top of each column. The dependent variables
are deﬁned in the legend of Table A.2 and are averaged across transactions by bond either during the 30-day
window before Moody’s published the Primary Algorithm or after the bond’s recalibration date. We include
in the regressions uninsured bonds with trading in both 30-day periods before Moody’s published the Primary
Algorithm and after the bond’s recalibration date. Panel A captures the effect of recalibration on bond yields and
spreads with Upgrade, an indicator variable taking a value of one if the bond experienced an upgrade as a result of
its recalibration and zero if the bond experienced no change in ratings. Post recalibration is an indicator variable
taking a value of one if the observation is from the 30-day window after the bond’s recalibration date and zero
if the observation is from the 30-day period prior to the publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm. We exclude
data from the day of the bond’s recalibration. Other control variables are deﬁned in the legend of Table A.2. Issue
rating pre-recalibration FE are ﬁxed effects based on the bond’s rating before the bond’s recalibration. Notches
represents the change in the rating around the recalibration in terms of number of notches. Panel B captures the
effect of recalibration on changes in average yields and spreads with Notches. Issuer level of government FE
are ﬁxed effects based on whether the issuer is a state, county, city, or other. Issuer state FE are ﬁxed effects
based on the issuer’s state. Moody’s sector FE are ﬁxed effects based on the four sectors into which Moody’s
classiﬁes bonds in its Primary Algorithm. We measure the percentage of each bond’s principal held by insurance
companies at the time of Moody’s recalibration using Annual Fraternal, Life, Property, Separate Accounts, and
Title & Health Data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Column (6) replicates
column (5) after excluding bonds with any nonzero holdings by insurance companies. Standard errors are in
parentheses below coefﬁcient estimates. We cluster standard errors by issuer. *, **, and *** indicate statistical
signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

are ﬁxed effects based on Moody’s classiﬁcation.20 Moody’s sector FE are
ﬁxed effects based on the four sectors into which Moody’s classiﬁes bonds in
its Primary Algorithm.21 We cluster standard errors by issuer.

The coefﬁcients on Post recalibration in Panel A indicate that the average
Raw yield is lower (13 bp, signiﬁcant at 5%) and the average credit spreads
are higher (6 to 27 bp, signiﬁcant at 5% or 1%) in the later time period.
Because yields and spreads are time varying, we cannot infer any impact of the
recalibration from this observation. The interaction term reported in the top row
captures the important difference-in-differences. The treatment group’s yields
declined by 6 bp, and credit spreads declined by 19 to 33 bp (signiﬁcant at 5%
or 1%) relative to the control group.

Because we focus on retail-size trades, we believe that we have a clean
test of the muni market reaction to new information communicated by the
recalibrated ratings, free from any confounding regulatory compliance effects.
As a robustness test, we replicate Table 4 after excluding issues with any
holdings by insurance companies. We believe that excluding retail transactions
for bonds that have any level of insurance company holdings is a very stringent
ﬁlter.22 However, despite the reduction in sample size, Table 4 results remain
signiﬁcant across each of the dependent variables. To conserve space, we
tabulate this robustness test in column (6) only for the dependent variable
employed in column (5).

In lieu of the binary indicator Upgrade, Table 4, Panel B, captures the effect of
rating recalibration on average yields and credit spreads with a discrete variable.
Notches is the difference between Rating post-recalibration and Rating pre-
recalibration. As suggested by Figure 1, we ﬁnd that the recalibration effect
is larger in magnitude for municipalities whose bonds experienced larger
upgrades. For each notch outstanding bonds are upgraded during recalibration,
ex post Raw yield is 7 bp lower compared with the control group. For each notch
of upgrade, spreads are lower by 12 to 18 bp. This result implies that spreads
fall 36 to 54 bp for bonds upgraded three notches. As in Panel A, results are
robust in column (6) to the highly stringent exclusion of transactions for bonds
with any level of insurance company holdings.

We replicate Table 4 under a wide variety of alternative speciﬁcations. We
do not tabulate these results in the interest of conserving space. We ﬁnd
the results are fully robust to including ﬁxed effects for rating levels in the

20 Moody’s classiﬁes municipal issuers into four groups: states, counties, cities, and other. The “state” category
includes state agencies such as the California Housing Authority. The “other” category includes school districts
and other special tax districts. Some examples from this category are the Birmingham Waterworks Sewer Board
in Alabama, the City of Columbus School District in Ohio, and the Las Vegas Valley Water District in Nevada.

21 We sort bonds into sectors based on the ﬁeld “Sector” in Moody’s data.
22 For example, this ﬁlter would screen out a retail-sized trade for an issue held 99% by retail investors and 1% by
institutional investors and for which there were no institutional trades. Because we have no reason to believe that
institutional holdings create any regulatory-based demand among retail investors, this robustness test imposes a
very conservative hurdle for sample inclusion.

post-recalibration period instead of the pre-recalibration period. The results
are also fully robust to clustering standard errors by a host of alternative
dimensions, such as by bond, issuer’s state, the four recalibration dates, pre-
or post-recalibration period, issuer’s state × pre- or post-recalibration period,
issuer’s state × the bond’s rating in the pre- or post-recalibration period, the
four recalibration dates × the bond’s rating in the pre- or post-recalibration
period, and the four recalibration dates × the issuer’s state. We further replicate
each of these speciﬁcations using Notches instead of Upgrade to capture the
recalibration effect and obtain results similar to those reported in Table 4,
Panel B.

3.2 Alternative hypotheses
The results thus far indicate that investors reacted to Moody’s recalibration.
This section considers several alternative explanations for this ﬁnding.

3.2.1 Do the results reﬂect differences in returns that already existed before
the recalibration? A potential concern regarding the analysis thus far is that
our results may reﬂect differences in returns that already existed before Moody’s
recalibration. We address this concern with a placebo analysis. We replace
each of the four recalibration dates with false dates drawn randomly from the
period 180 to 30 days before the ﬁrst actual recalibration date. If the spreads on
the upgraded bonds were already drifting upward relative to the non-upgraded
bonds prior to the recalibration, then we should see results similar to our baseline
when using event dates in the year prior to implementation. We replicate the
regression in Table 4, Panel A, column (5), using the false dates. We complete
this process a total of 10,000 times. Each time, we collect the t−statistic for
the coefﬁcient on Post recalibration × Upgrade. Figure 3 plots a distribution
of these t−statistics. The t-statistic from Table 4, Panel A, column (5), is –2.6
and lies in the lower 1% of the placebo distribution. This analysis demonstrates
the uniqueness of the market reaction to the actual implementation dates.

3.2.2 Do the results reﬂect changes in liquidity?
Harris and Piwowar
(2006) show that municipal bond liquidity increases with credit quality. If
rating upgrades resulting from the recalibration are associated with perceived
improvements in credit quality, then liquidity for upgraded bonds should
increase, leading to lower returns due to lower liquidity premiums. We test
this possibility in Table 5. Table 5 regressions employ Daily volume as the
dependent variable, deﬁned as the natural logarithm of the average daily trading
volume for customers buying munis during the period before or after the bond’s
recalibration date. Control variables are the same as those employed in Table 4.
The sample in Table 5 consists of 7,341 bonds with at least one customer
transaction in the 90 days before the publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm
and the 90 days after the recalibration dates, resulting in 14,682 observations.
(See Table A.1 for sample reconciliation.)

t-statistic

Figure 3
Histogram of placebo test results
This ﬁgure displays a histogram of t-statistics from 10,000 placebo regressions in which we replicate the
regression in Table 4, Panel A, column (5), after randomly replacing each of the four implementation dates
with false dates drawn randomly from the period 180 to 30 days before the announcement date, March 16, 2010.
The t-statistics come from the coefﬁcient on Post recalibration × Upgrade. The vertical dashed line represents
the t-statistic from the true regression in Table 4, Panel A, column (5).

The interaction term Upgrade × Post recalibration reported in the top row
of column (1) indeed indicates an increase in trading volume after the ratings
changes. Signiﬁcant at 1%, this result adds further evidence that muni investors
responded to Moody’s scale recalibration.

Column (1) indicates that the liquidity of the upgraded bonds improved
relative to the non-upgraded bonds. In light of this ﬁnding, one might infer
that the results in Figure 1 and Table 4 reﬂect changes in liquidity, rather than
investors responding to credit ratings for information purposes. However, this
interpretation implies that upgraded bonds exhibit a permanent increase in
liquidity relative to non-upgraded bonds. We test this possibility in column
(2) after substituting Post recalibration with delay for Post recalibration.
Post recalibration with delay is an indicator variable taking a value of one
if the observation is from the window [90,179] days relative to the bond’s
recalibration date and zero if the observation is from the window [–90,–1] days
prior to the publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm. This approach allows
us to test whether average daily trading volume remains elevated for upgraded

This table displays OLS regression results with Daily volume as the dependent variable. This variable is the
natural logarithm of the average daily trading volume for customers buying municipal bonds during the 90-day
window centered on the bond’s recalibration date. We calculate trading volume using secondary market trading
data from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). The sample consists of 7,341 uninsured bonds
with at least one transaction by a customer in the 90 days prior to the publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm
and the 90 days after the recalibration date (resulting in 14,682 observations). Upgrade is an indicator variable
taking a value of one if the bond experienced an upgrade during the recalibration event and zero if the bond
experienced no change in ratings. Post recalibration is an indicator variable taking a value of one if the observation
is from the window [0,89] days relative to the bond’s recalibration date and zero if the observation is from the
window [–90,–1] days prior to the publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm. Post recalibration with delay is
an indicator variable taking a value of one if the observation is from the window [90,179] days relative to the
bond’s recalibration date and zero if the observation is from the window [–90,-1] days prior to the publication

Credit Ratings and the Cost of Municipal Financing

3.2.3 Are the results driven by a sudden decline in returns for non-
upgraded bonds? Our results could obtain if the returns for the non-upgraded
bonds happened to be abnormally low around the time of the recalibration. We
address this possibility two ways. First, we provide more detail regarding the
cumulative returns of the non-upgraded bonds underlying Figure 1. Figure A.2
in the Internet Appendix displays separate plots for bonds upgraded zero, one,
two, and three notches for each of the four recalibration dates. These plots
generally show that the cumulative returns for the non-upgraded bonds behave
very similarly to those of the upgraded bonds in the days leading up to the
publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm. In some cases, the cumulative
returns for the non-upgraded bonds are actually higher than those of the
soon-to-be-upgraded bonds.

Second, we compare the changes in spreads of the non-upgraded bonds
around the time of the recalibration and in the period preceding Moody’s
publication of its Primary Algorithm. Figure 4 displays a histogram of placebo
average changes in spreads for the non-upgraded bonds drawing random dates
from the 180-day period prior to when the bonds’ ratings were recalibrated.
This ﬁgure effectively reproduces the dependent variable from Table 4, Panel A,
column (5), for the non-upgraded bonds many times with placebo recalibration
dates. If the returns of the non-upgraded bonds were abnormally low around the
time of the recalibration, then we should see the true change in Spread to after-
tax Treasury2 lie outside the placebo distribution. This is not what we observe.
If anything, the changes in spreads for the non-upgraded bonds are slightly
higher (although not signiﬁcantly so) around the time of the recalibration in
comparison to their own recent history.

3.2.4 Are the results driven by shifts in demand for certain levels of
governments’ bonds? Table A.3 in the Internet Appendix replicates the
speciﬁcation in Table 4, Panel A, column (5), after splitting the sample by issuer
level of government. This table shows that the secondary market results are
driven primarily by state-level issuers and issuers at other levels of government.
The results are weaker for county- and city-level issuers. We dig deeper into
these patterns to investigate whether the main results in Table 4 could be driven
by shifts in demand for bonds issued by certain levels of government, rather
than investors responding to changes in ratings.

We control for this possibility directly in Table A.4 in the Internet Appendix.
Here, we replicate Table 4 after including the issuer level of government ﬁxed
effects that vary by pre- and post-treatment ﬁgures. For example, instead of
including a ﬁxed effect for the state of California, as we do in Table 4, Table A.4
includes one ﬁxed effect for California in the pre-treatment period and another
for California in the post-treatment period. Under this speciﬁcation, our main
results are virtually unchanged, indicating our results do not reﬂect a change
in taste among investors for bonds from different levels of government during
the time of the recalibration.

Change in spread for control group

Figure 4
Histogram of placebo average change in spread for the control group
Each of the four recalibration events include zero-notch upgrades, and these non-upgraded bonds compose our
control group. Comparing spreads in the 30 days before versus 30 days after the bonds are recalibrated, we
observe an average change in spread of 0.07139%. The vertical dashed line indicates this amount. This ﬁgure
reﬂects similar calculations after we randomly draw placebo dates from the 180-day period prior to when the
bonds were recalibrated. For example, for a bond that received a zero-notch upgrade on April 16, 2010, we
randomly draw a placebo date from the 180-day period before the publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm
(March 16, 2010) and compute the change in spread from the 30-day window before the placebo date to the
spread during the window 31 to 60 days after the placebo date. This gap between the two periods accounts for the
30-day gap between the publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm and April 16, 2010. For a bond that received
a zero-notch upgrade on April 23, 2010, we randomly draw a placebo date from the 180-day period before the
publication of Moody’s Primary Algorithm (March 16, 2010) and compute the change in spread from the 30-day
window before the placebo date to the spread in the window 38 to 67 days after the placebo date. We do this
for all non-upgraded bonds across the four recalibration dates and compute the average. We repeat this process
10,000 times and construct the displayed histogram.

3.2.5 Are the results driven by differential changes in fundamentals for the
upgraded and non-upgraded bonds? Moody’s claims that the recalibration
was intentionally uncorrelated with changes in issuer fundamentals. However,
it is possible that Moody’s selected bonds for upgrades that were experiencing
strengthening fundamentals. We believe this explanation is unlikely for two
reasons. First, as mentioned above, Moody’s indicated that any bonds under
review going into the recalibration would remain under review after the
recalibration. In other words, bonds that Moody’s believed were due for natural
rating changes would receive proper consideration for those changes after the
recalibration had concluded.

Second, we examine the behavior of S&P’s ratings around the time
of Moody’s recalibration. If Moody’s recalibration reﬂects changes in

Figure 5
Average Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s credit ratings through time
This ﬁgure displays average credit ratings for uninsured municipal bonds rated by Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s from a four-year period centered on Moody’s recalibration. We separate the bonds by whether their
ratings were upgraded as a result of Moody’s recalibration. The vertical dashed line represents April 2010. We
convert Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s 21-point alphanumeric scales into numbers. Ratings are increasing in
credit quality, such that Aaa/AAA = 21, Aa1/AA+= 20,…, C/C = 1. We collect credit ratings from Moody’s
website and Standard & Poor’s RatingsDirect.

fundamentals, then we should expect S&P to eventually enact rating changes
that correlate with those of Moody’s. Table A.7 in the Internet Appendix
provides detailed transition matrices of S&P’s ratings from before the
recalibration to a year after. We observe no clear evidence that S&P responded to
Moody’s recalibration. Most bonds rated by S&P retain their ratings at least one
year after the recalibration. For example, of the 26,582 bonds with AA+ ratings
from S&P, 25,155 of them still have AA+ ratings a year after the recalibration.
A similar, consistent pattern appears at each rating level.

Further, we examine the long-run behavior of Moody’s and S&P’s ratings
in Figure 5. In this ﬁgure, we compute average ratings on uninsured bonds
with ratings from both Moody’s and S&P over a four-year period centered on
Moody’s recalibration. We separate these bonds based on whether they were
upgraded as a result of Moody’s recalibration and report average ratings by
month for these subgroups of bonds.

Among upgraded bonds (plotted with solid lines in Figure 5), we observe
that Moody’s ratings are lower than S&P’s in 2008 and 2009 but then converge

due to recalibration and remain comparable to S&P’s ratings through the end
of our data availability. Among the control group that did not upgrade due to
recalibration (plotted with dashed lines), we observe that Moody’s ratings are
higher than S&P’s by approximately one notch over the entire four-year period.
The stability in Moody’s ratings after recalibration afﬁrms our conclusion that
the recalibration was a permanent change in ratings.

3.3 Evidence from new issues
We consider next the extent to which market reliance on credit ratings has
real economic effects. Speciﬁcally, we examine the impact on new debt
pricing and new debt issuance. In light of the secondary market results
above, we predict that upgraded municipalities face lower borrowing costs
in the primary market as a result of their higher ratings. To the extent
that previously higher borrowing costs (associated with the more stringent
rating standards) discouraged municipal investment, we predict an increase
in borrowing among the upgraded municipalities. We test both predictions in a
difference-in-differences framework.

In the preceding tests of secondary market prices and trading volume, our
treatment and control groups consist of recalibrated bonds. In this section, we
deﬁne treatment and control groups at the municipality level.23 Speciﬁcally,
the treatment group contains municipalities whose outstanding bonds were
recalibrated up at least one notch. The control group contains municipalities
whose outstanding bonds had a “Change in Scale” rating action of zero notches.
In order to analyze effects at the issuer level, we calculate the average ratings
of all outstanding bonds for each issuer before and after recalibration dates.
(The modal within-issuer standard deviation of credit ratings is zero notches.)
We refer to these averages as Issuer rating pre-recalibration and Issuer rating
post-recalibration, respectively.

We examine ﬁrst the impact on new issue pricing in multivariate regressions,
with results reported in Table 6. We calculate the average characteristics of
new, uninsured issues for each issuer in the year before and, separately, the
year after the issuer’s outstanding bonds were recalibrated. We compute the
change in each bond characteristic for each issuer. This approach results in one
observation per issuer. Dependent variables are changes in yields and spreads.
Raw yield is the offer yield in all analyses of new issues. Each of the credit
spread variables is deﬁned in Section 2.4. We control for changes in issue
characteristics and report summary statistics for this issuer-level sample in
Table A.5.24 In order to capture variation in the liquidity of issuers’ bonds, we

23 Untabulated results at the bond level produce qualitatively similar results to the issuer-level analysis that follows.
By distilling the bond-level observations into one observation per issuer, we avoid the concern that oversampling
could prop up the statistical signiﬁcance of the results.

24 The Internet Appendix also contains a detailed sample reconciliation in Table A.20.

also control for the change in the number of bonds outstanding. Fixed effects
are similar to those in Table 4.

As in Panel A of Table 4, Panel A of Table 6 captures the effect of
recalibration on changes in new issue pricing with the indicator variable
Upgrade. Controlling for pre-recalibration rating level, issuer state, and level of
government, along with average changes in new issue characteristics, we ﬁnd
that upgraded municipalities face lower ﬁnancing costs, relative to the control
group, following recalibration. Differences in Raw yield average 15 bp, and
differences in credit spreads range 18 to 22 bp. Each of these differences is
signiﬁcant at 5% or 1%.

Panel B employs the discrete variable Notches, deﬁned here as the
difference between the Issuer rating post-recalibration and Issuer rating pre-
recalibration. Controlling for the same factors—including rating level—we
ﬁnd that each notch of upgrade results in a reduction in yield (spread) of 11
bp (11 to 14 bp). This result implies that a municipality whose bonds were
upgraded three notches would enjoy spreads on new issues that are 33 to 42 bp
lower than a similar municipality whose ratings were not upgraded.

This table displays OLS regression results with changes in various measures of offer yields and spreads as the
dependent variable. The dependent variables appear at the top of each column. The dependent variables are
deﬁned in the legend of Table A.5. Panel A captures the effect of recalibration on changes in issuers’ yields and
credit spreads with Upgrade, an indicator variable taking a value of one if the issuer experienced an upgrade
on its outstanding bonds during any of the recalibration events and zero if the issuer’s bonds experienced no
change in ratings. Other control variables are deﬁned in the legend of Table A.5. We calculate the average rating
of all outstanding bonds for each issuer before (Issuer rating pre-recalibration) and after (Issuer rating post-
recalibration) the recalibration dates. Notches represents the change in this number rounded to the nearest whole
number. Panel B captures the effect of recalibration on changes in issuers’ yields and credit spreads with Notches.
Issuer rating pre-recalibration FE are ﬁxed effects based on the average rating of all outstanding bonds for each
issuer before its recalibration date. Issuer level of government FE are ﬁxed effects based on whether the issuer is
a state, county, city, or other. Issuer state FE are ﬁxed effects based on the issuer’s state. Standard errors are in
parentheses below coefﬁcient estimates. *, **, and *** indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
levels, respectively.

Overall, we conclude from Table 6 that investors’ reliance on ratings to price
bonds, combined with Moody’s dual-class rating system, was costly for U.S.
taxpayers. Over $640 billion in uninsured municipal debt was upgraded during
the recalibration (Table 1), and our most conservative estimate of the average
impact on new issue yields is 15 bp. The product of $640 billion and 15 bp is
$960 million. This ﬁgure is an estimate of aggregate annual excess interest (in
2010 dollars). For context, the average cost to build a new elementary school
is approximately $7 million (in 2013 dollars).25

Credit Ratings and the Cost of Municipal Financing

Table 6 results are robust to a wide variety of untabulated alternative
speciﬁcations. These speciﬁcations include employing ﬁxed effects for rating
levels in the post-recalibration period instead of the pre-recalibration period. We
also cluster standard errors by issuer state, Issuer rating pre-recalibration, and
Issuer rating post-recalibration. We include linear controls for Issuer rating
pre-recalibration and Issuer rating post-recalibration in lieu of rating ﬁxed
effects. Results in all of these speciﬁcations are similar in signiﬁcance and
magnitude to those reported in Table 6. In Table A.6, we split the sample based
on rating categories in the pre- and post-recalibration periods. We ﬁnd the
results are robust across most categories. The noteworthy exception is the group
recalibrated out of the Baa-range, for which we lack sufﬁcient observations to
estimate the model. (See the Internet Appendix for details.)

We examine next the extent to which upgraded municipalities capitalized on
their lower borrowing costs. We ﬁnd evidence that the recalibration expanded
municipal debt capacity. Figure 6 shows that, relative to issuance levels in the
year before the recalibration, issuers of both upgraded and non-upgraded bonds
actually issue less debt in the year after the recalibration. However, this decline
in issuance activity is less pronounced for the upgraded issuers. Panel A shows
that upgraded issuers experience a signiﬁcantly higher increase in issuance
volume compared with non-upgraded issuers two years after the recalibration.
Panels B and C split the sample in Panel A by whether the bonds are GO (Panel
B) or revenue bonds (Panel C). Panel B shows broadly similar patterns to those
in Panel A. After two years, upgraded issuers of GO bonds issue marginally
signiﬁcantly more bonds than non-upgraded issuers. A stronger pattern emerges
in Panel C. This panel shows that upgraded issuers of revenue bonds experience
a signiﬁcantly larger increase in their issuance activity compared with non-
upgraded bonds in the ﬁrst year after the recalibration. Overall, to the extent
that increased municipal borrowing results in increased municipal investment,
our results show that market reliance on credit ratings effects real investment
as well as taxpayer ﬁnancing costs.

3.4 Variation in information environment
The SEC Ofﬁce of Investor Education and Advocacy warns, “While some
investors ﬁnd it helpful to consider credit ratings when making an investment
decision, it is important that you not rely solely on credit ratings when
deciding whether to purchase municipal bonds.”26 To test the extent to which
muni investors consider other sources of information, we employ a variety
of proxies that capture cross-sectional variation in municipalities’ information
environments. We further examine proxies for issuer opacity and corruption,
assuming that information provided by corrupt municipalities is less reliable.
We also consider whether S&P rated the bonds. If markets rely exclusively on

Figure 6
Bond issuance for upgraded and non-upgraded issuers
This ﬁgure displays average issue volume of upgraded and non-upgraded issuers before and after the recalibration.
For each issuer, we compute the total par value of bonds issued in the year before the recalibration. We normalize
this value to one and compute total par value of new issues relative to this amount in the years after recalibration.
The sample includes only municipalities that issue at least one bond in the year before, the year after, and two
years after recalibration. Panel A displays issuance of all bond types. Panels B and C restrict the sample to
General Obligation bonds and Revenue bonds, respectively. Dotted lines represent 95% conﬁdence intervals.
The data come from the Ipreo i-Deal new issues database.

ratings, then the price reaction to an upgrade should not vary by the availability
of other information.

In Table 7, we revisit the multivariate regression model reported in column
(5) of Table 6, Panel A, using Spread to after-tax Treasury2 as the dependent
variable. (Results below are robust to using Raw yield or the other three
measures of spreads. We report results with Spread to after-tax Treasury2
because we believe it is our most precise measure of muni pricing.) Here,
we include proxies for issuer opacity and corruption as independent variables.
We include summary statistics for these variables in Table A.5. In Table 7,
we include in columns (1) through (3) indicator variables for the issuer level
of government. We conjecture that investors have better information about the
ﬁnancial health of larger, more transparent issuers (states) than they have for
counties and cities. The variable State in column (1) compares states to the
combined set of counties, cities, and other municipal issuers. The interaction
term Upgrade × State indicates that the recalibration effect documented in
Table 6 is muted by 27 bp among state issuers relative to non-state issuers. In
contrast, the interaction term Upgrade × City in column (3) indicates that the
recalibration effect is exacerbated among cities by an average of 17 bp relative
to non-city issuers. To the extent that states (cites) are relatively transparent
(opaque), these results suggest that muni market reliance on credit ratings is
greatest in the weakest information environments.

Column (4) employs the indicator variable Opaque, which takes the value of
one if the issuer is, or is located in, a state with above-median opacity according
to a state-level index developed by U.S. Public Interest Research Group.27 Con-
sistent with variation in market reliance on ratings across information environ-
ments, the interaction term Upgrade × Opaque indicates that the recalibration
effect is stronger among issuers from states with below-median disclosure.

We consider in column (5) whether the upgraded issuers are also rated by
S&P. Butler (2008) argues that nonrated bonds are harder for underwriters
to sell. Although all of the bonds in our sample are rated by Moody’s, the
information provided by Moody’s should be especially important when S&P
does not provide a rating. Indeed, the interaction term Upgrade × Not rated by
S&P indicates that the market reliance on Moody’s ratings is stronger (15 bp
signiﬁcant at 10%) among the set for which no guidance is provided by S&P.
Columns (6) through (8) bifurcate the sample based on measures of
corruption risk. Butler, Fauver, and Mortal (2009) document that higher state
corruption is associated with greater credit risk and bond yields. Ang et al.
(Forthcoming) further document that higher state corruption is associated with

27 The U.S. PIRG ranks the 50 states according to the extent to which they provide online access to government
spending data. The opacity index is from the year of Moody’s recalibration (2010). Although we use new issue
data from one year before to one year after recalibration, we assume this measure of opacity for any particular state
is similar through the sample period. Opacity scores are available at http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/following-
money-2011.

This table displays OLS regression results with  Spread to after-tax Treasury2 as the dependent variable. This variable is deﬁned in the legend of Table A.5. Upgrade is an indicator
variable taking a value of one if the issuer experienced an upgrade on its outstanding bonds during any of the recalibration events and zero if the issuer’s bonds experienced no change
in ratings. State (County, City) is an indicator variable taking a value of one if the issuer is a state (county, city) and zero if the issuer is any other level of government. Opaque
is an indicator taking a value of one if the issuer is, or is located in, a state with above-median opacity. We measure opacity with a state-level index developed by U.S. PIRG that
evaluates the 50 states by the extent to which they provide online access to government spending data. The opacity index is from 2010. Not rated by S&P is an indicator variable taking
a value of one if none of the issuer’s bonds were rated by S&P in the year prior to Moody’s recalibration and zero otherwise. CorruptRisk index f rom SI I is an indicator variable
taking a value of one if the issuer is, or is located within, a state with above-median corruption risk. We measure corruption risk with a state-level corruption risk index developed by
the State Integrity Investigation. The corruption risk index is a snapshot from 2013. CorruptConvict ions 2010 is the number of public ofﬁcials convicted of corruption in the issuer’s
state in 2010 divided by the state’s population in the same year, standardized to follow a mean-zero, unit-variance distribution. CorruptConvict ions 2010−2012 is the average number
of public ofﬁcials convicted of corruption in the issuer’s state from 2010 to 2012 divided by the state’s average population over the same time period, standardized to follow a mean-
zero, unit-variance distribution. Convictions data are available on an annual basis from the U.S. Department of Justice’s website. Control variables are deﬁned in the legend of Table
A.5. Issuer rating pre-recalibration FE and Issuer rating post-recalibration FE are ﬁxed effects based on the average rating of all outstanding bonds for each issuer before and after
the recalibration dates, respectively. Issuer level of government FE are ﬁxed effects based on whether the issuer is a state, county, city, or other. Issuer state FE are ﬁxed effects
based on the issuer’s state. Standard errors are in parentheses below coefﬁcient estimates. *, **, and *** indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

greater value destruction by advanced refunding. We posit that corrupt states
have less reliable disclosure and test whether market participants therefore rely
more heavily on ratings when pricing new issues from these states. Column
(6) employs a measure of corruption risk provided by the State Integrity
Investigation (SII).28 Columns (7) and (8) consider the number of public
ofﬁcials convicted of corruption, obtained from the U.S. Department of Justice.
In column (7), we focus on corruption convictions in the year of the recalibration
event. In column (8), we consider the conviction rate over the 2010–12 window.
We use convictions data from years shortly after the recalibration event because
convictions represent the culmination of the legal process (e.g., arrests and
indictments that occurred in earlier years). Therefore, convictions from 2010
to 2012 may reﬂect corruption that came to light around the time of the
recalibration. We standardize each proxy to follow a mean-zero, unit-variance
distribution.

The direct effect of corruption risk in columns (7) and (8) is an 8-bp increase
in credit spreads, signiﬁcant at 5%. The interaction terms in these speciﬁcations
indicate that Moody’s recalibration effect is stronger (signiﬁcant at 5%) among
municipal issuers from corrupt states. This result suggests a certiﬁcation role
of the CRA in a manner similar to the underwriter certiﬁcation role in an initial
public offering (IPO) of a previously private and therefore opaque ﬁrm. Overall,
results from Table 7 support the conclusion that market reliance on credit
ratings appears greatest in the weakest information environments. Because bond
prices reﬂect information not captured in the credit rating, our results suggest
some level of investor due diligence even in a market dominated by retail
investors.

3.5 Regulatory effects of credit ratings
Because our research setting is the municipal bond market, a market dominated
by unregulated investors, we conclude that the market reaction to Moody’s
recalibration cannot be attributed to an increase in demand for highly rated
securities among regulated investors. However, many observers feel that
ratings matter primarily, if not only, because of their regulatory implications.
We attempt to provide direct tests for this explanation in this section. We
start by categorizing upgrades based on their likely regulatory implications.
Speciﬁcally, reserve requirements and other ratings-based regulations are
typically written around broad rating categories (e.g., Aaa, Aa, A, Baa) rather
than notches (e.g., Aa1, Aa2, Aa3).

In order to isolate the effect of a regulatory threshold from magnitude
of upgrade, we examine one-notch upgrades separately from two-notch

28 The corruption risk index is a snapshot from 2013. We assume the corruption risk in 2013 is correlated with such
risk over our sample period. Corruption risk measures are available at http://www.stateintegrity.org/your_state.

upgrades.29 We ﬁrst restrict our treatment group to one-notch upgrades and
separate bonds upgraded into a new broad rating category (e.g., from A1 to
Aa3) from those remaining in the original broad category (e.g., A2 to A1).
Separately, we restrict our treatment group to two-notch upgrades and separate
bonds upgraded into a new broad rating category (e.g., from A2 to Aa3) from
those that remain in the original broad rating category (e.g., A3 to A1). In
either case, the upgrades crossing a broad rating category should have greater
regulatory implications than upgrades of the same magnitude that do not cross
a threshold.

We test the regulatory hypothesis in Table 8. In Panel A, we compare changes
in secondary market spreads (relative to the control group) in a multivariate
framework with ﬁxed effects (as in Table 4). We ﬁnd no differential impact
of the recalibration among upgraded bonds that do and do not cross into new
broad rating categories. These non-results corroborate the idea that our main
results do not reﬂect changes in regulation-based demand.

In Panel B, we compare the primary market credit spreads at the issuer
level (relative to the control group with zero-notch upgrades) in a multivariate
framework, as in Table 6. The direct effect Regulatory status change drops
from the regressions because this variable does not vary by issuer from the pre-
recalibration period to the post-recalibration period. We also exclude Issuer
rating pre-recalibration FE because this characteristic correlates with whether
upgraded issuers change regulatory status. (For example, upgraded issuers with
pre-recalibration ratings of Aa1, Moody’s highest rating in the Aa category,
necessarily change regulatory status.) In this panel, column (1) shows a greater
impact of Moody’s recalibration among issuers whose bonds were upgraded
one notch across a regulatory threshold relative to those with one notch upgrades
that remained within a broad rating category. This 15-bp difference is signiﬁcant
at 5% and is the only evidence we have to support a regulatory channel by which
credit ratings impact muni prices. Column (2) shows no signiﬁcant result among
the two-notch upgrades.

Given (limited) evidence to support the regulatory channel in column (1),
we further test for regulatory effects among this sample. Speciﬁcally, some
ratings-based regulations include “lowest rating binds” provisions. We test for
effects of such regulations by adjusting the criteria for Regulatory status change.
We refer to the criteria used thus far as “criteria i.” Under “criteria ii,” the
variable Regulatory status change takes a value of one if the issuer’s bonds
had more pessimistic ratings from Moody’s than S&P prior to recalibration
and equal to or more optimistic than S&P after recalibration. Regulatory status
change takes a value of zero for issuers whose bonds were not upgraded as a
result of recalibration, upgraded issuers whose bonds still have more pessimistic
ratings from Moody’s than S&P after recalibration, or upgraded issuers whose

29 All else equal, a two-notch upgrade is more likely to cross into a new broad rating category than a one-notch
upgrade. We discard upgrades greater than two notches because they necessarily cross into new broad categories.

bonds had equal or more optimistic ratings from Moody’s than S&P before
recalibration.

We introduce Regulatory status change under criteria ii to our baseline
regression and interact it with Upgrade. We focus on issuers whose bonds were
upgraded zero notches or one notch because this sample has more observations
than the sample of issuers upgraded zero or two notches. If the effect of the
recalibration is stronger among upgraded issuers whose bonds experienced
a change in regulatory status, then the coefﬁcient on this interaction term
should be negative. Although the sign is negative, the coefﬁcient on Upgrade
× Regulatory status change is insigniﬁcant. The result appears in column (3)
in Panel B.

We conduct two additional tests to address the possibility that criteria i
and criteria ii overlap. First, we redeﬁne Regulatory status change as the
intersection of criteria i and ii. This approach allows us to test for regulatory
effects among a select group of issuers whose bonds almost certainly changed

Panel A displays OLS regression results with Spread to after-tax Treasury2 as the dependent variable. This variable is
deﬁned in the legend of Table A.2 and is averaged across transactions by bond either during the 30-day window before
Moody’s published the Primary Algorithm or after the bond’s recalibration date. We require the bonds to have trading
in both 30-day periods before Moody’s published the Primary Algorithm and after the bond’s recalibration date to be
included in the regressions. Post recalibration is an indicator variable taking a value of one if the observation is from
the 30-day window after the bond’s recalibration date and zero if the observation is from the 30-day period prior to
Moody’s publication of the Primary Algorithm. We exclude data from the day of the bond’s recalibration. Upgrade is
an indicator variable taking a value of one if the bond experienced an upgrade during the recalibration event and zero if
the bond experienced no change in ratings. Regulatory status change is an indicator variable taking a value of zero for
bonds that were not upgraded as a result of recalibration or were upgraded but remained within the same broad rating
category. Other control variables are deﬁned in the legend of Table A.2. Issue rating pre-recalibration FE are ﬁxed effects
based on the bond’s rating before the bond’s recalibration. Issuer level of government FE are ﬁxed effects based on
whether the issuer is a state, county, city, or other. Issuer state FE are ﬁxed effects based on the issuer’s state. Moody’s
sector FE are ﬁxed effects based on the four sectors into which Moody’s classiﬁes bonds in its Primary Algorithm. We
obtain municipal bond prices from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). We cluster standard errors by
issuer.
Panel B displays OLS regression results with  Spread to after-tax Treasury2 as the dependent variable. This variable
is deﬁned in the legend of Table A.5. For this panel, Upgrade is an indicator variable taking a value of one if the issuer
experienced an upgrade on its outstanding bonds during any of the recalibration events and zero if the issuer’s bonds
experienced no change in ratings. In column 1 (column 2) Regulatory status change is an indicator variable taking a value
of one if the issuer’s bonds changed regulatory status as a result of recalibration and zero if not. We use two criteria to
identify issuers whose bonds change regulatory status. For criteria i., Regulatory status change is an indicator variable
taking a value of one if the issuer’s bonds were upgraded one notch as a result of recalibration and the rating change
crossed into a new broad rating category. Under criteria i, Regulatory status change takes a vale of zero for issuers whose
bonds were not upgraded as a result of recalibration or whose bonds were upgraded one notch but remained within the
same broad rating category. For criteria ii, Regulatory status change is an indicator variable taking a value of one if the
issuer’s bonds had more pessimistic ratings from Moody’s than S&P prior to recalibration and equal to or more optimistic
than S&P after recalibration. Under criteria ii, Regulatory status change takes a value of zero for issuers whose bonds
were not upgraded as a result of recalibration, upgraded issuers whose bonds have more pessimistic ratings from Moody’s
than S&P after recalibration, or upgraded issuers whose bonds had equal or more optimistic ratings from Moody’s than
S&P before recalibration. The regression in column (4) deﬁnes Regulatory status change as the intersection of criteria i
and ii. The regression in column (5) deﬁnes Regulatory status change as the union of criteria i and ii. Control variables
are deﬁned in the legend of Table A.5. *, **, and *** indicate statistical signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
respectively.

regulatory status. Column (4) in Panel C contains the results. The coefﬁcient on
Upgrade × Regulatory status change is large (–27 bp) but insigniﬁcant. Next,
we redeﬁne Regulatory status change as the union of criteria i and ii. This
approach liberalizes the deﬁnition of which issuers’ bonds changed regulatory
status. The coefﬁcient on Upgrade × Regulatory status change is negative but
insigniﬁcant. Overall, Table 8 provides at most limited support for a regulatory
effect of the recalibration, no matter how we deﬁne a change in regulatory
status.

4. Conclusion

Our contribution to the literature is evidence that credit ratings affect securities
prices because investors rely on them to assess credit risk, not just because
ratings affect regulatory compliance costs. This is the core and classic function
of credit ratings. Despite advances in information technology and a rise in
alternative sources for credit risk analysis, we show that investors still rely on
ratings in the modern era. However, in contrast to an exclusive reliance on
ratings, we also ﬁnd that investors rely most heavily on credit ratings in the
poorest information environments. Finally, we document that investor reliance
on credit ratings has real economic effects for issuers and taxpayers.

This evidence is important for several reasons. First, the premise that
investors take ratings at face value underlies a host of high-proﬁle lawsuits
following the recent ﬁnancial crisis, including cases brought against Moody’s
and S&P by the U.S. Department of Justice. Second, our results indicate
that efforts to reduce regulatory reliance on ratings (FSB Principle I and
Dodd-Frank Section 939A) will not negate the role of credit rating agencies
in the economy. We conclude that regulators concerned about mechanistic
reliance on ratings—and municipal issuers concerned about the fairness of
rating standards that vary across asset classes—should focus on increasing
and standardizing disclosure requirements across state and local governments.
Such disclosure improvements should further support regulatory efforts to
protect retail investors participating in muni markets.30 Our results from the
municipal market suggest similar beneﬁts to increased transparency among
currently opaque special-purpose entities issuing structure ﬁnance products.

Finally, we estimate that Moody’s more stringent municipal rating scale,
coupled with investor reliance on ratings to price risk, cost taxpayers an
aggregate $960 million annually in excess interest. This estimate is conservative
as it reﬂects only the aggregate excess interest of our sample of uninsured
bonds. A more comprehensive estimate would include any excess insurance
premiums paid by municipalities choosing to purchase bond insurance
rather than pay higher interest rates. This estimate is timely as the U.S.

Credit Ratings and the Cost of Municipal Financing

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (2011) considers the Dodd-Frank
mandate to standardize credit ratings across all rated securities (see §938). This
estimate should also be of interest to the states, cities, and public agencies that
have called for an end to the dual-class rating system. For example, the State
of Connecticut recently ﬁled (and settled) a lawsuit against the rating agencies,
stating, “The credit rating agencies and bond insurers have enjoyed enormous
proﬁts, at the expense of taxpayers, as a result of this deceptive dual rating
system. The harm to taxpayers across the country is real and substantial.”31
