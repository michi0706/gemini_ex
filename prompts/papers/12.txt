CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENT IN RESOURCE

POOLING FAMILY NETWORKS*

Manuela Angelucci, Giacomo De Giorgi and Imran Rasul

This article examines a novel motive for resource pooling in family networks in rural economies: to
relax credit constraints and facilitate investment in non-collateraliseable assets for which credit
market imperfections are most binding. We thus complement established literatures examining risk-
sharing motives for resource transfers within family networks, as well as motives based on kinship tax
obligations. We do so exploiting the Progresa programme data, in which family networks can be
identiﬁed, households are subject to large exogenous resource inﬂows, and detailed responses on
consumption and an array of investments can be tracked in a household panel over ﬁve years.

Households in low-income rural economies face multiple market imperfections. An
established literature has studied the causes and consequences of imperfections in
credit, insurance and ﬁnancial markets (Besley, 1995). A key insight to emerge has
been the critical role extended families play in allowing households to overcome such
market imperfections. In both developing and developed economy settings, such
networks have been documented to engage in informal arrangements,
involving
resource ﬂows across network members (Cox and Fafchamps, 2008; Attanasio et al.,
2015), with such arrangements being enforced through a combination of self-interest,
altruism and social pressure (Coate and Ravallion, 1993; Platteau, 2000).

A prominent strand of this literature examines how extended families enable
member households to smooth consumption in response to idiosyncratic income risks
(Rosenzweig, 1988; Rosenzweig and Stark, 1989; Foster and Rosenzweig, 2001;
Fafchamps and Lund, 2003; La Ferrara, 2003; Samphantharak and Townsend, 2010;
Karaivanov and Townsend, 2014). Key to such informal arrangements are that they are
reciprocal, involve state-contingent resource transfers towards those facing negative
shocks and they are efﬁciency enhancing.1

A second emerging strand of literature highlights the resource transfers that take
place in family networks because of informal kinship taxes being levied on members
(Baland et al., 2011; DiFalco and Bulte, 2011; Jakiela and Ozier, 2016; Squires, 2016).
In contrast to risk-sharing transfers, such resource ﬂows need not be reciprocal or be

1 The seminal works on testing for consumption smoothing are Cochrane (1991), Mace (1991) and
Townsend (1994). Following this line of work, caste-based networks have also been identiﬁed as forming
informal risk-sharing agreements (Munshi, 2011; Mazzocco and Saini, 2012; Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2016).

channelled towards poorer network members and, most importantly, their existence
typically entails efﬁciency costs through distortions. Such kinship tax distortions have
been documented to exist across a range of household decisions including those
related to consumption (DiFalco and Bulte, 2011), savings (Boltz-Lemmel, 2013),
labour market participation (Baland et al., 2015) and capital allocations into family
enterprises (Squires, 2016). Kinship taxes might also cause households to devote
resources hiding their income from network members and thus avoid social
obligations altogether (Kinnan, 2014; Jakiela and Ozier, 2016); it has been long
recognised that the kinds of allocative and productive distortions arising from kinship
taxes can lead to poverty traps (Nurkse, 1953; Lewis, 1954).

In this article, we study a third motive for resource ﬂows within family networks. We
take as motivation the long tradition in development economics emphasising that
households in agrarian economies are engaged in both consumption and investment/
production decisions (Eswaran and Kotwal, 1986; Singh et al., 1986; Benjamin, 1992).
The interlinkage in these outcomes for household-ﬁrms has been understudied in the
twin literatures above, on risk sharing and kinship taxes. We combine insights by
studying whether extended family networks pool resources to help relax credit
constraints members face and facilitate higher return investments to be undertaken. If
so, then in contrast to kinship taxes, this represents a mechanism through which
extended family members can eventually escape poverty traps.2,3

More precisely, we consider how consumption and investment decisions are
interlinked for households subject to imperfect credit markets. We do so for two
types of household: those we describe as being connected because they are embedded
within a village-based extended family network that pools resources among its
members, and those that are isolated and have none of their family members in close
geographic proximity and therefore have to rely on their own resources to a greater
extent. Relative to isolated households, family networks can relax credit constraints
member households face in investment choices. The extent to which family networks
foster household investment depends on the interplay between credit markets, asset
characteristics and network resources. We contrast less lumpy and collateralisable
assets, such as small livestock (poultry) for which credit markets are well functioning,
with lumpier and non-collateraliseable investments such as those into human capital,
for which borrowing constraints are most severe.

How the increase in resources impacts consumption is closely tied to its impact on
investment. If the resources are invested, current consumption may decrease (but
future consumption could increase as the returns to investment are realised. In
general, the larger the increase in investment, the lower the increase in current
consumption for both connected and isolated households.

2 Kinnan and Townsend (2012) and Karaivanov and Townsend (2014) are two exceptions in the literature
that also jointly study consumption and investment decisions, doing so for Thai household-ﬁrms for which
rich panel data exists on both dimensions. They document the importance of kin groups for consumption
smoothing and easing credit constraints to facilitate household investment.

3 Other forms of (in-kind) transfer within extended family networks have also been documented and
studied, including those used to cement social ties (e.g. ceremonial payments), to pool labour, to share
information on labour market opportunities, to create rotating savings and credit associations and child
fostering/adoption (Cox and Fafchamps, 2008; Boltz-Lemmel, 2013).

To take these ideas to data, we exploit the experimental evaluation of the Progresa
programme, a large-scale anti-poverty policy intervention providing cash transfers to
eligible (poor) households in rural Mexico. We empirically document the consump-
tion and investment responses of connected and isolated households
to the
conditional cash transfers provided by Progresa, exploiting ﬁve features of the data.

First, we combine information on the paternal and maternal surnames of household
heads and spouses, with the Spanish naming convention to construct family networks
in each village. Following the same procedure as our earlier work (Angelucci et al.,
2010), we map extended family networks in 500 villages (encompassing over 20,000
households) in rural Mexico. This allows us to distinguish between connected
households with a family network in the same village and isolated households that have
none of their family residing in close geographical proximity.4

Second, we exploit the randomised research design used to evaluate Progresa: 320
villages were randomly assigned to be treated with Progresa, with the remaining villages
retained as controls. Following a partial population experimental design (Mofﬁtt,
2001), eligible and ineligible households are identiﬁed in both treatment and control
villages.

Third, eligible households in treated locations are subject to exogenous and large
resource inﬂows. The average monthly transfer to eligibles corresponds to 36% of their
pre-programme monthly food expenditures. More importantly, we document that
family networks span eligibility status: some members are eligible while others are
ineligible. Among connected and eligible households, over 80% of their extended
family are also eligible. Hence extended family networks as a whole experience
substantial resource inﬂows due to Progresa: on average, these amount to the total
monthly income of 0.60 households in the family network. Given the average network
size is 7.5 households, the resource injection provided by Progresa is non-trivial, with the
potential to foster large consumption and investment responses among network
members if the family pools transfers. These resource inﬂows can enable some
members to undertake non-collateralisable investments, such as those into the human
capital of their children, even though the value of transfers any given household
receives remains below what is required to self-ﬁnance such investments (Schultz, 2004;
De Janvry and Sadoulet, 2006).

Fourth, detailed panel data were collected on both food consumption and
investment choices for over 20,000 households every six months before and after
intervention, something that remains rare among household panels (Karaivanov and
Townsend, 2014). On investment, the data span a rich array of assets varying in their
collateralisability: from holdings of small livestock (such as poultry) for which credit
constraints are unlikely to bind, through to entirely non-collateralisable forms of asset
such as human capital.

Finally, we are able to study the longer term impacts of resource inﬂows by
exploiting a ﬁnal wave of data from ﬁve years after households ﬁrst experience receipt

4 Names and familial linkages have been exploited in studies of intergenerational mobility (Clark et al.,
2014; G€uell et al., 2015). In the context of Progresa, Attanasio and Lechene (2014) use a similar algorithm to
measure the relative size of husband and wife’s extended family in the same village, proxying intrahousehold
distributional factors when estimating a conditional demand system.

of transfers. This sheds light on whether the capacity of family networks to relax credit
constraints causes sustained increases in investment and, as the returns to such
investments are realised, then feedbacks into higher longer term consumption relative
to isolated households.

Under standard assumptions, the experimental research design identiﬁes:

(i) the average treatment effect (ATE) of resource inﬂows from a comparison of

eligibles in treatment and control villages; and

(ii) the indirect treatment effect (ITE) of resource inﬂows from a comparison of
ineligibles in treatment and control villages (Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009).

We identify ATEs and ITEs for isolated and connected households. Finally, to exploit
the full richness of our data, we estimate impacts of exogenous resource inﬂows at the
level of the family network as a whole: this provides a network average treatment effect
(NATE) that summarises how family networks respond to resource inﬂows, irrespective
of which household in the network experiences the resource transfer. We provide
NATE estimates on mean consumption and investment, on consumption and
investment inequality within networks, and provide novel estimates of how consump-
tion and investment impacts vary with features of the family network architecture.

On consumption we document:

(i) eligible connected households signiﬁcantly increase their food expenditures
by 32.7 pesos relative to connected households in control villages (this ATE
corresponds to a near 23% increase in food consumption over its baseline
level);

(ii) ineligible connected households also signiﬁcantly increase their consumption
by 22.6 pesos (this ITE corresponds to a 16% over baseline levels) relative to
ineligible and connected households in control villages, thus providing direct
evidence of resource pooling in extended family networks;

(iii) among eligibles, the implied marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of
their own resource transfer is 0.691; among ineligibles the implied MPC to
consume out of the transfer received per network member is 0.639. This
implies that for every dollar that accrues to the family network as a whole, food
consumption increases by around 65¢ for both households in the network
eligible for Progresa transfers and ineligible members of the same network. The
implied marginal propensity of families to invest/save out of every dollar is
thus around 0.35; and

(iv) the NATE estimates indicate consumption inequality within family networks
does not change as poorer eligibles experience positive resource increases,
consistent with household Pareto weights not changing over the study period.

In contrast, we ﬁnd that eligible but isolated households have no statistically
signiﬁcant change in their consumption relative to counterfactual isolated households
in control villages. Although this impact is imprecisely estimated, it is signiﬁcantly
different from the change in consumption of eligible connected households. Hence
there is a need to also consider households’ investment outcomes in order to move
towards a more complete understanding of how isolated households utilise the
resource transfer Progresa represents.

On investment, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant increase in collateralisable assets such as small
animals (poultry) among isolated or connected households. This is as expected if there
is a well-functioning credit market for such assets.

We ﬁnd eligible isolated households use a signiﬁcant fraction of their resource
inﬂow to invest in cattle, as has been documented for rural Indian households by
Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993). Cattle are of intermediate collateralisability and are
likely to generate earnings from produce sales that co-vary less with their other income
streams (Townsend, 1994; Bandiera et al., 2017).

In contrast, eligible and connected households

signiﬁcantly increase non-
collateralisable investments into human capital as measured by secondary school
enrolment rates. In short, less collateralisable forms of investments are signiﬁcantly
responsive to household resources, in line with Karaivanov and Townsend (2014). We
ﬁnd:

(i) eligible connected households signiﬁcantly increase their schooling invest-
ment by 7.5pp relative to counterfactual connected households in control
villages (a 12% increase over the baseline level); and

(ii) eligible but isolated households have no such response, and the difference
between these impacts is highly signiﬁcant, despite isolated and connected
households receiving similar resource inﬂows and having the same baseline
levels of secondary school enrolment.

Given Progresa transfers are insufﬁcient to cover the opportunity cost of secondary
schooling, such non-collateralisable investments can only be undertaken by connected
households because they are engaged in resource pooling arrangements with family
members. These results closely match the ﬁndings of Kinnan and Townsend (2012)
who report kin networks in Thailand facilitate large investment expenditures through
the relaxation of borrowing constraints. Considering the family network as the unit of
analysis, our NATE estimates then show that for the average connected household,
secondary school enrolment increases by 6.0pp relative to counterfactual family
networks in control villages.

Network architecture matters: larger and more closely linked family networks have
larger consumption responses and these same networks are also those with marginally
smaller investment responses. These twin results suggest such network features
underlie precisely how resources are allocated in informal sharing arrangements
(Ambrus et al., 2014; Chandrasekhar et al., 2014).

Finally, we examine the longer term impacts of family networks on consumption and
human capital investment using the ﬁnal wave of panel data from ﬁve years after the
initial resource transfers. We ﬁnd:

(i) households embedded within family networks have monthly food expendi-
tures that are 19.8 pesos higher than for isolated households, corresponding
to a 14% increase over baseline levels; and

(ii) the longer term gap in secondary school enrolment rates is sustained at 6.4 pp,

corresponding to just under 10% of the baseline levels.

This suggests the interplay between large resource inﬂows and resource pooling by
family networks might well place them on sustained paths out of poverty and allow

them to escape the kinds of poverty trap that have long concerned development
economists.

The key contribution of the article is to highlight an understudied channel for
resource ﬂows within extended family networks: to foster investments into non-
collateraliseable assets. This complements established literatures examining the role
that family networks play in allowing households to smooth consumption in the face of
idiosyncratic resource shocks, and the role that kinship taxes levied within such
networks have on the allocative and productive efﬁciency of household decisions. Our
article also builds on earlier work studying Progresa. The ﬁrst generation of Progresa
evaluations focused on the average treatment effects on schooling decisions for eligible
households (Schultz, 2004; Todd and Wolpin, 2006; Attanasio et al., 2012). A second
wave of papers has examined the impacts of Progresa on other outcomes including
investment and entrepreneurship (Gertler et al., 2012; Bianchi and Bobba, 2013). In
most of this work, ineligible households have predominantly been exploited to check
for spillover or general equilibrium effects of the programme operating through
prices, labour and credit markets (Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009; Bobonis and Finan,
2009; Lalive and Cattaneo, 2009).

A third generation of study has exploited information on surnames to pin down
social ties between households and then used this to explore heterogenous treatment
responses to Progresa. Our earlier work, Angelucci et al. (2010) did so focusing only on
schooling outcomes and providing suggestive evidence of resource transfers within
family networks facilitating such investments. In this article, we consider a richer set of
consumption and investment outcomes. In particular, our ITE impacts on consump-
tion get to the heart of whether there is resource pooling within family networks or
not. We then provide new estimates of consumption and investment responses at the
network level, how inequality of consumption and investment in networks is impacted
(over an array of asset investments varying in their collateralisability) and of how both
responses vary as a function of network architecture. The ﬁnal innovation over the
existing literature is to identify longer term impacts of being embedded within family
networks on this set of consumption and investment outcomes. This is key to
understanding the role that family networks can play in enabling members to escape
poverty traps.5

The article is organised as follows. Section 1 describes a conceptual framework.
Section 2 presents our context, data and empirical methods. Sections 3 and 4 cover the
results on consumption and investment respectively. Section 5 examines longer term
outcomes. Section 6 concludes by discussing further implications of our ﬁndings.

1. Conceptual Framework

We now describe how households’ consumption and investment responses to Progresa
differ depending on whether the household is isolated, in that none of their extended

5 Angelucci and De Giorgi (2009) documented the existence of spillover effects of consumption from
eligible to ineligible households and identiﬁed the likely channel through which this occurred, informal gifts
and transfers. However, that paper used no data on family networks and did not study any speciﬁc institution
through which these transfers occur.

family reside in the same village, or whether they are connected, and so embedded
within an extended family network in the same village.

1.1. Isolated Households

We recognise that isolated households may have extended family elsewhere and share
resources with them.6 However, in the context of responses to Progresa, it is important
to note the evaluation data covers a period when the programme was still being rolled
out in villages across rural Mexico. Hence isolated households are unlikely to have
family members in other villages where Progresa had been rolled out. Even if isolated
households have eligible family in other Progresa villages in the study period, networks
that are more geographically dispersed likely face higher monitoring and enforcement
costs to sustain any resource pooling arrangement (Fafchamps and Gubert, 2007;
Conley and Udry, 2010).7

For expositional ease, we describe the consumption and investment responses of
isolated households to Progresa assuming there are no resource ﬂows with their
extended family (that reside in other villages). We denote the per period resources,
consumption and investment of isolated household h(i) as Rh(i), Ch(i) and Ih(i),
respectively, (where i is used to denote that the household is isolated). We denote the
savings of the isolated household as Sh(i). Using the superscript E for eligibles, the
following budget accounting identity holds for eligible isolated households:

DR E

hðiÞ ¼ DC E

hðiÞ þ DI E

hðiÞ þ DS E
hðiÞ:

(1)

All terms in (1) are deﬁned at the household level. DR E

hðiÞ corresponds to the
resource injection due to Progresa that eligible isolated households experience, and is
detailed in Section 2: this increase is of course partly conditional on changes in school
enrolment by households. For some households, they may need to reduce consump-
tion to use any transfer to send their children to secondary school. An increase in
resources can increase investment by relaxing credit constraints. This is especially so
for lumpy, non-collateralisable assets (such as large livestock and education), which are
harder to borrow against, than more liquid forms of investment (such as small
livestock), for which credit markets likely exist. Consumption may increase, decrease,
or remain unchanged depending on the effect on investment.

The core analysis in Sections 3 and 4 documents the consumption and investment
hðiÞ,

responses to Progresa of eligible isolated households: DC E

hðiÞ and DI E

hðiÞ=DR E

hðiÞ=DR E

6 For example, many Mexican households receive migrant remittances from overseas. However, this is far
less the case in the Progresa sample of rural households: for example, Angelucci (2015) documents that in
1998, fewer than 1% (4%) of households in control villages report having a member migrated to the US
(elsewhere in Mexico).

7 On the importance of private information for resource transfers in the context of risk sharing:

(i) Ligon (1998) develops an empirical test showing that private information plays an important role

in shaping the allocations in village economies in Indian data; and

(ii) Kinnan (2014) develops a test to distinguish between hidden income, limited commitment and

moral hazard as motives for incomplete informal insurance.

Using household panel data from rural Thailand, limited commitment and moral hazard are rejected, while
there is empirical support for the predictions of hidden income.

where the former corresponds to the marginal propensity to consume out of Progresa
transfers. Finally, we note that our analysis does not focus on the third term, the
changes in savings that eligible isolated households experience. Such crowding in/out
of resources might well occur (Albarran and Attanasio, 2003; Cox and Fafchamps,
2008), although such impacts are notoriously hard to measure accurately in most low-
income settings including in this one (Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009). Our aim is not
to establish the identity in (1) but to highlight that resource inﬂows can be channelled
towards consumption and investment purposes, the balance between the two might
differ between isolated and connected households, as might the forms of investment
undertaken by both types of household.8

1.2. Connected Households



Connected households are embedded within family networks in the same village and
these networks are assumed to pool resources across members. The underlying motives
for such redistribution can relate to consumption smoothing, kinship taxes, or to
foster investment and the objective of networks is to maximise the sum of utilities of
their members. The relevant unit of analysis is the family network as a whole, denoted
n(c). In family networks the following budget accounting identity holds:

DRnðcÞ ¼

DR E

nðcÞ ¼

n2nðcÞ DCnðcÞ þ DInðcÞ þ DSnðcÞ

n2nðcÞE

(2)
where the total resource injection to the family network, DRn(c), sums Progresa transfers
across eligible members of the family, denoted n 2 nðcÞE , while on the right-hand side,
we sum over all network members (both eligibles and ineligibles). The total resource
inﬂow to family networks is detailed in Section 2: this increase is of course partly
conditional on changes in school enrolment by all eligible households in the network. As
with isolated households, absent resource pooling in the family network, some connected
households may also need to reduce consumption to use any transfer to send their
children to secondary school. Thinking through the right-hand side highlights three key
empirical implications of resource pooling arrangements in family networks.



;

First, because of resource pooling, there can be consumption responses to Progresa by
nðcÞ=DRnðcÞ [ 0 where we use the
ineligible households in the extended family, i.e. DC NE
superscript NE to denote an ineligible member of the family network of an eligible
household, n(c). Without a fully speciﬁed micro-founded model of network behaviour, we
have an ambiguous prediction on the relative change in consumption of eligible and
ineligible connected households, i.e. DC E
nðcÞ=DRnðcÞ. These two consump-
tion responses correspond to the ATE and ITE of Progresa, estimated in Section 3.
Comparing budget accounting identities (1) and (2) also makes clear there is no prediction
of the relative consumption responses of eligible isolated and connected households.

nðcÞ=DRnðcÞ T DC NE

The novel motive for resource pooling in family networks is that it enables member
households to undertake certain investments they could not otherwise self-ﬁnance in
the face of imperfect credit markets. Investments into assets that are lumpy and

8 For ineligible isolated households, the LHS of (1) is obviously zero, so that consumption and investment
responses can only occur if Progresa causes general equilibrium effects in goods or asset markets. This is
testable and something we address below.

non-collateralisable are especially likely to be aided by resource pooling within
extended family networks because there is no credit market to invest in such assets
(non-collateralisability) and individual households cannot accumulate enough
savings alone to make such investments (lumpiness). The ﬁrst implication of (2) is
thus to examine the investment responses to Progresa over a variety of assets that vary
in their collateralisability: the ATE and ITE impacts of Progresa on investment are
presented in Section 4. Together, these shed light on whether resource pooling
enables richer or poorer households within the network to undertake additional
investments.

DCnðcÞ=DRnðcÞ,

Finally, to exploit the full richness of our data, we estimate impacts of Progresa at
DInðcÞ=DRnðcÞ. This
the level of the family network as a whole:
provides a network average treatment effect (NATE) that summarises how family
networks affect consumption and investment responses to resource inﬂows among
their members, irrespective of which household in the network experiences the
resource transfer. We provide NATE estimates on mean consumption and invest-
ment, on consumption and investment inequality within networks, and provide
novel estimates of how both impacts vary with features of the family network
architecture.9

2. Context, Data and Methods

2.1. Context

Progresa is a large-scale government intervention providing cash transfers to poor
households conditional on children’s attendance at school and mother’s attendance
at health facilities. An experimental research design was implemented to evaluate
Progresa: the evaluation involved collecting panel data on 20,000 households every six
months in 503 villages between March 1998 and November 1999. The evaluation took
place while the programme was being scaled-up across villages in rural Mexico.
Villages were selected into the evaluation sample if they were sufﬁciently poor. Credit
markets are highly imperfect in this setting, providing scope for extended family
networks to play an important role in household’s consumption and investment
decisions.

To detail the kinds of credit market imperfection prevalent in rural Mexico, we note
that in the third wave of data (November 1998) households were asked about the
sources and uses of loans/transfers: only 2.8% households report having outstanding
loans, and less than 1% report having access to formal credit. Among those using
formal
loans, 66% of households report using them to ﬁnance investment into
livestock, agriculture or businesses. In contrast, among those using informal credit,

9 In family networks with only one eligible member, the change in resources (at the network level) is the
same as for isolated households. Hence there should be no difference in their investment choices. However,
we cannot study this subsample of networks separately because as the descriptives below make clear, the large
majority of networks have at least two eligibles in them. Hence when we restrict the analysis to connected
households that are the only eligible household in their network, given the small sample sizes involved, it is
not surprising that the impacts on consumption and investment are not precisely estimated (and so the
ﬁnding that such connected households also have no signiﬁcant increase in their investment is not a very
powerful test of the intuition above).

76% of households report, using such loans to ﬁnance consumption and other
emergencies.10

To understand whether Progresa transfers could be used to ﬁnance investments into
non-collateralisable assets, we note that while the average monthly transfer to
eligibles is non-negligible, corresponding to 35% of pre-programme monthly food
consumption expenditures, this magnitude remains far below what is required for
households to self-ﬁnance non-collateralisable investments into human capital: for
example, Schultz (2004) ﬁnds that the value of transfers corresponds to between one
half to two thirds of the full time child wage in the survey villages; De Janvry and
Sadoulet (2006) argue that transfers correspond to around 40% of what children of
the same age would earn. In either case, the transfers do not fully compensate for
foregone earnings of secondary school aged children employed full time in the
labour market.11

In the pre-programme period households were asked the main reason why children
did not attend school: for those with children aged between 6 and 18, 39% cited a lack
of ﬁnancial resources, and a further 11% cited needing the child to work or help at
home. Hence if multiple households in the same family network were to be in receipt
of Progresa transfers and these households pooled resources, it would be possible for
them to channel resources towards some network members and enable such
investments into non-collateralisable assets to occur.

Of the sampled villages, 320 were randomly assigned to receive Progresa from
May 1998, and 183 were assigned as controls. Two pre-programme survey waves
were conducted (October 1997, March 1998). The other waves occur post-
intervention (November 1998, May 1999, November 1999). To study the longer
term impacts on consumption and investment outcomes of connected versus
isolated households, we exploit a ﬁnal wave of data from November 2003. Finally,
we match our panel data to administrative records detailing the potential and
actual transfers provided to each household. Table A1 in the Appendix describes
the key variables and survey waves used.12

In 1997, households were classiﬁed as either being eligible (poor) or ineligible (not
poor) for Progresa transfers according to a household poverty index, designed to give
relatively greater weight to correlates of permanent rather than current income.
Around three quarters of households are classiﬁed as eligible: as shown later, this

10 In other low-income settings, such informal arrangements have been documented to include the use of
state-contingent informal loans (Udry, 1994), or gifts and other quasi-credit arrangements (Platteau, 1997).
11 Relatedly, Todd and Wolpin (2006) note that to the extent that children engage in work in family
enterprises/farms, the opportunity cost of their labour is not even the market wage but their marginal
product in family enterprises/farms: that is even harder to measure. Finally, Attanasio et al. (2012) also
present evidence suggesting the opportunity cost of schooling is not fully offset by the value of transfers:
more precisely they document using a structural model, that a revenue neutral change in the programme
that would increase the grant for secondary school children while eliminating for the primary school children
would have a substantially larger effect on enrolment of the latter, while having minor effects on the former.
12 Control villages began receiving Progresa transfers in December 1999. In 1997, eligibles in control
villages were informed they would receive the programme from the end of 1999 conditional on them still
being eligible and the programme continuing. We do not ﬁnd any evidence households in treated villages are
more likely to attrit between October 1997 and November 2003, nor is there evidence of differential attrition
of connected households in treated villages relative to control villages.

implies the typical family network will have many eligible members.13 The transfers
correspond to exogenous increases resources to eligible households, with uncertainty
as to whether transfers would be available beyond 1999.

In family networks, we observe eligibles and ineligibles. This allows us to measure
whether the consumption responses of households in a network are the same irrespective
of which network member received the transfers (DC E
nðcÞ=DRnðcÞ); and for
non-collateralisable investments, to examine whether poorer (eligible) or richer
members of the network are able to undertake such investments when their network
experiences resource inﬂows (DI E
nðcÞ=DRnðcÞ). There is variation in the
monetary value of transfers households (and therefore networks) are eligible for
depending on a non-linear relationship with the demographic composition of children
pre-programme: transfers conditional on school enrolment are larger for higher school
grades, and for girls within any given grade.14

2.2. Constructing Family Networks

To identify the extended family links between households in the same village, we use
the same procedure described in Angelucci et al. (2010), exploiting information on:

(i) surnames provided in the third wave of data; and
(ii) the naming convention in Mexico.

As the Progresa evaluation data represent a near census of households in each village,
we construct complete extended family network structures for all 20,000 households in
over 500 villages.15

Mexicans use two surnames: the ﬁrst is inherited from the father’s paternal lineage
and the second from the mother’s paternal lineage. For example, former Mexican
president Vicente Fox Quesada would be identiﬁed by his given name (Vicente), his
father’s paternal name (Fox) and his mother’s paternal name (Quesada). Respondents
were asked to provide the:

(i) given name;
(ii) paternal surname; and
(iii) maternal surname, for each household member.

13 Households were informed that their eligibility status would not change at least until November 1999,
irrespective of any variation in household income. A group of households, known as densiﬁcados, had their
eligibility status reclassiﬁed from non-eligible to eligible in October 1998. A non-random subset of them
began receiving Progresa transfers in treatment villages prior to November 1999. As no precise algorithm
exists to determine which densiﬁcados received transfers in treatment villages, no counterfactual set of
households exists for them in control villages. Hence we do not consider such households in our analysis of
consumption and investment outcomes.

14 By November 1999 the bimonthly transfer ranged from 160 pesos for third grade, to 530 (610) pesos for
boys (girls) in ninth grade. The total amount received bimonthly by a household cannot however exceed
1,500 pesos.

15 A concern arises from the surnames data being measured in the ﬁrst wave post-programme, in that
households may endogenously respond to the programme by changing household structures. In particular,
by artiﬁcially forming new households in order to increase the number of eligibles in the family. This concern
is ameliorated by the fact that the register of eligibles was drawn up at baseline, and only households
recorded to be eligible at that point were later entitled to receive transfers.

Hence couple headed households have four associated surnames: the paternal and
maternal surnames of the head, and the paternal and maternal surnames of his wife.16
Figure 1 illustrates the algorithm used to link households. To deﬁne each link, we use
information on two of the four surnames. Consider household A at the root of the family
tree. The head of the household has paternal and maternal surnames F1 and f 1 respectively.
His wife has paternal and maternal surnames F 2 and f 2 respectively.17 The children of the
couple in household A will adopt the paternal surnames of their father (F1) and mother
(F 2). Hence we identify a parent-son family link between households A and B if:

(i) the paternal surname of the head in household B is the same as the paternal

surname of the head in household A (F1); and

Fig. 1. Family Tree

Notes. We use the convention that the head’s surnames are written in standard font, and those of
his wife are written in italics. Paternal surnames are indicated in upper case (F1, F2) and maternal
surnames are indicated in lower case (f1, f2). First names are not shown as they are not relevant to
the construction of extended family ties. Each household in the family tree is assumed to be couple
headed purely to ease the exposition. Colour ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com.

16 The wording of the question in Spanish is, ‘Dıgame por favor el nombre completo con todo y apellidos de todas
las personas que viven en este hogar, empezando por (jefe del hogar) – (i) nombre; (ii) apellido paterno; (iii) apellido
materno’. We cleaned the surnames data as follows:

(i) we removed non-alphabetical characters, replaced ‘Sin Apellido’ (no surname) with missing values,

and corrected some obvious typographical errors based on intra-household surname checks;

(ii) we imputed a small number of missing female surnames from wave 2; and
(iii) we veriﬁed surnames using the same information from wave 5, and veriﬁed the relationship to the

household head using wave 1 data.

No information on surnames is available in the ﬁrst wave of data. The head of household is originally deﬁned
to be the main income earner. In a very small number of cases, the head of a couple headed household is
reported to be a woman. To keep clear the exposition, we redeﬁne the head to be male in such cases.

17 Paternal (maternal) surnames are indicated in upper (lower) case. First names are not shown as they are
irrelevant to the matching algorithm. In Anglo Saxon countries, F1 corresponds to the family name and F2
corresponds to the spouse’s maiden name.

(ii) the maternal surname of the head in household B is the same as the paternal

surname of the spouse in household A (F2).

Parent-daughter family-links can be similarly identiﬁed. Moreover, family links
between siblings can also be identiﬁed. For example, the heads of households B and C
are identiﬁed to be brothers if they share the same paternal and maternal surnames.
We impose the following restrictions when deﬁning family links:

(i) inter-generational

links exist when the relevant individuals have at least
15 years age difference, and no more than 60 years age difference between
mother and child; and

(ii) intra-generational links exist when the individuals have at most 30 years age

difference.

We thus identify households with at least one ﬁrst-degree relative in the village, as
well as the entire network of ﬁrst-degree relatives. Hence all the households in Figure 1
would belong to the same ﬁrst-degree extended family network, even though some are
ﬁrst cousins, or linked across two generations. Figure 1 shows all households to be
couple headed to ease the exposition. To deal with the 15% of households that are
single headed we use additional information on the gender of the head to identify
family links. Although such single headed households are then used to construct the
extended family networks, we focus our analysis of consumption and investment
outcomes on the 85% of households that are couple-headed.18

There are of course limits to our algorithm. For example, two households headed by
cousins will not be recorded as belonging to the same extended family unless both sets
of parents are present. Angelucci et al. (2010) provides more descriptive evidence on
surnames in this setting, and provides external validity to the created links using data
from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS). More precisely, we show how the
number of ﬁrst-degree relatives rural households have alive in any location, as
recorded in the MxFLS, compares, on average, to the number of relatives our
algorithm suggests reside in the same village for rural households.19

18 There are additional limits involving single headed households. Consider links from household i to a
single headed household j. As Figure 1 shows, the fact that household j is single headed does not affect the
construction of links from the head and spouse of household i either to their children or to their siblings.
However, links from the head (spouse) of household i to the household of his (her) parents can only be
identiﬁed if both his (her) parents are alive and resident together because this particular link is identiﬁed
using information from household j on the paternal surnames of both the head and spouse. However this is
unlikely to be a major issue: we note that female widows aged above 40 are 37% more likely to live as a
dependent within a household, rather than head their own household, relative to a similar married woman.
These single parents are recorded in the household roster.

19 There are several potential forms of measurement error in surnames that we can check for, as described
in Angelucci et al. (2010). The ﬁrst arises from the convention that women change their paternal surname to
their husband’s paternal surname at the time of marriage (although the wording of the survey question
speciﬁcally asks respondents to name the paternal and maternal surname of each household member). In
5.8% of households is the spouse’s maternal surname recorded to be the same as her husband’s paternal
surname. Second, if the male head is the respondent, he may not recall his wife’s maternal surname and
simply replace it with her paternal surname (as his children only inherit his wife’s paternal surname). This
occurs in only 4.9% of households. A ﬁnal circumspect case is households in which the paternal and maternal
surnames of both the head and spouse are all reported to be the same. This occurs for 1.6% of households
and drops to 0.5% if we exclude households with the most common surname. There are no differences in the
incidence of these potential errors between treatment and control villages.

2.3. Networks

T H E E C O N O M I C J O U R N A L

[ N O V E M B E R

Panel (a) of Table 1 shows that 80% of households are connected, so have at least one
other extended family member heading their own household in the village. Thus 20%
of households are isolated in that none of their extended family members reside in the
same village. There are on average 7.5 members in each family network, highlighting
the potential importance of informal resource pooling arrangements within families.
Our analysis among connected households is based on 1,379 (817) unique family
networks in treatment (control) villages covering 10,559 (6,471) households.

2.4. Consumption and Investment at Baseline

Panel (b) of Table 1 presents data on food consumption, measured in adult
equivalents. Food consumption is based on seven day recalls over 36 food items
(Table A1 provides further details). Monthly food expenditures are 144 pesos. Given a
daily poverty line of $1.25, 70% of households lie below this threshold if we aggregate
per capita food and non-food expenditures. Figure 2(a) shows the distribution of daily
per capita expenditures across couple headed households pre-programme. This
reiterates the absolute poverty these households experience and the fact they lack
resources to ﬁnance many forms of investment.

Panel (c) focuses on household investments, split between livestock and schooling.
The collateralisability of such assets varies between these extremes depending partly on
the transactions costs lenders face in reselling assets used as collateral in the case of
borrower default. To recognise this continuity in asset collateralisability, among
livestock we consider the division between investments in small animals (chickens,
rabbits, pigs and goats) and larger animals (donkeys, horses, cows and oxen). Over
80% of households own some form of small livestock, typically poultry. The thick
market for such assets makes small livestock highly collateralisable. In contrast, only
around 40% of households own larger animals such as cattle and there are high
transactions costs from their resale. Hence larger animals can be classiﬁed as being of
intermediate collateralisability. The value of owned livestock is almost identical across
isolated and connected households pre-programme, as are the separate values of
owned small and large livestock.20

On entirely non-collateralisable human capital investments, primary enrolment rates
are above 90% for households at baseline, so that most choose to send their children to
school even absent Progresa. In contrast, secondary school enrolment rates are lower, at
around 65%. Hence this is the relevant margin of schooling investment choice. As the
value of transfers is insufﬁcient to offset credit constraints related to this investment,
for poorer (eligible) connected households, the ability to pool resources within the
family network is key for such investments to be undertaken.

20 Fafchamps and Pender (1997) estimate a structural model of irreversible investment decisions and ﬁnd
that poor farmers fail to undertake proﬁtable investments that they could in principle self-ﬁnance, because
the non-divisibility of these investments makes it infeasible to self-ﬁnance. Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993)
also emphasise the irreversibility of investment as leading to the choice of investments into bullocks rather
than irrigation equipment. We can think of this as being another important difference between small and
large livestock.

Impacts on the Distribution of Daily Per Capita Consumption Expenditures Connected Households

Notes. Figures 2(a) and (b) show the distribution of per capita household consumption (food and
non-food combined) in 1998, as measured at 2013 US dollars. Values are trimmed at $4. The
vertical line therefore corresponds to the global poverty line of $1.25/day. In Figure 2(a), all
couple headed households (eligible and ineligible) are included. The additional distributions
then include the per capita resources potentially available to eligible households from Progresa,
and those potentially available to ineligible households through resource transfers originating
from eligible members of their extended family network. In Figure 2(b), all couple headed
connected households (eligible and ineligible) are used. The Figure shows the distributional
impact on eligible households of the ATE of their own positive resource shock, and the
distributional
impact on ineligible impacts of the ITE of their family members receiving
resources, and redistributing them within the family network. Colour ﬁgure can be viewed at

Column (3) in Table 1 shows tests of equality between connected and isolated
households for each characteristic. At baseline, the two types of household are not
signiﬁcantly different on most dimensions, suggesting they have similar preferences
over consumption and investment. It is plausible that the Progresa programme is the
ﬁrst time the majority of households in these communities simultaneously experience
a large increase in resources and thus allow resource pooling families to overcome
borrowing constraints and spark non-collateralisable investments. To see if this can be
studied using the experimental research design of Progresa, columns (4) and (5) show
that within connected and isolated households, the samples are mostly balanced on
outcomes across treatment and control villages. Hence we can exploit the randomi-
sation to identify the causal impact of resource inﬂows on connected and isolated
households. The exception is for primary enrolment rates between connected and
isolated households, albeit the absolute difference is small (93% versus 91%). To
account for any pre-treatment differences in household preferences for schooling, we
thus control for the household’s primary school enrolment rate at baseline when
estimating investment responses related to human capital outcomes (secondary
schooling and child labour).

2.5. Transfers

We now describe data from administrative records on Progresa transfers that we match
to the main household panel. The ﬁrst row in panel (d) shows that just over 70% of
households are eligible. On the availability of transfers from extended family members,
among connected and eligible households, over 80% of their extended family are also
eligible. For ineligible (hence less poor) households, just over 50% of their extended
family are eligible: that this share is lower for ineligibles is unsurprising given there is
less variation in permanent income within than across extended families.

the average potential

transfer available per adult equivalent

The remaining rows in panel (d) show the value of these potential transfers to
connected households, measured in survey wave 3 (November 1998). Potential
transfers are those that would accrue to eligible households if they perfectly complied
with the programme’s conditionalities. If we assume such transfers are not shared with
others,
in eligible
households is 53 pesos per month. The next row considers the other case where
potential transfers are spread evenly across all family network households: in this
scenario, the average potential transfer available per adult equivalent in connected
households is 39 pesos per month. Column (3) conﬁrms there are no signiﬁcant
differences between connected and isolated households in terms of their eligibility
status or the value of transfers they can potentially receive. Nor do we ﬁnd any
signiﬁcant difference in the value of potential transfers available to connected and
isolated households.21

To benchmark the magnitude of these transfers, we ﬁrst note that potential transfers
represent around 36% of food consumption expenditures for eligible isolated and

21 We use the equivalence scale estimated by Di Maro (2004) from the same data. This sets a scale of one
for members 18 or older and 0.73 otherwise. We use the monthly Bank of Mexico CPI series to deﬂate
monetary values.

connected households. If we consider family networks in which transfers are spread
evenly across eligibles and ineligibles, the potential transfers available per household
correspond to 27% of the value of household food consumption (in adult equivalent
terms). If the potential transfers from Progresa were entirely used for consumption,
15% of eligible households could be moved above the poverty line, as shown by the
second distribution in Figure 2(a); taking into account potential per capita resource
transfers from eligible network members, then 14% of connected but ineligible
households could be moved above the poverty line, as shown by the third distribution
in Figure 2(a) (noting that ineligibles have higher levels of consumption to begin
with).

As Progresa transfers are conditional on children’s regular school attendance and
given high baseline enrolment rates, most eligibles would receive transfers even
absent any change in enrolment behaviour. Such de facto unconditional cash transfers
of course provide an income effect that enables households (connected or isolated)
to raise consumption and investment without any change in actual schooling
behaviour.

On the actual value of monthly transfers received, we ﬁnd that:

(i) transfers accruing to connected and isolated households are as follows: for
example, in survey wave 3 (November 1998), they correspond to 119 (112)
pesos for connected (isolated) households; and

(ii) between November 1998 and November 1999 (survey waves 3 to 5), the value
of actual transfers received corresponds to around 11–18% of the value of
household food consumption.

We can also benchmark these actual transfers against household and network levels of
monthly income. For example, household monthly income among eligible connected
(isolated) households is 1232 (1286) pesos. Hence, for connected eligibles, actual
Progresa transfers correspond to the total monthly income of 10% of eligible
households in the family network. Given networks on average contain 7.5 households
of which many are eligible, this again shows the resource injection provided by Progresa
to be non-trivial. In short there is scope for networks to experience resource inﬂows
large enough so as to help some of their members to overcome binding credit
constraints on non-collateralisable investments.22

2.6. Empirical Method

Consider outcome yhvt for household h in village v in survey wave t. Food consumption
outcomes are measured in pesos per adult equivalent. The investment outcomes
considered are livestock ownership (small, large animals) and secondary schooling,
representing investments of high, intermediate and low levels of collateralisability
respectively. We deﬁne three indicators:

22 Household income is deﬁned as labour income (summed over all household members), plus income
from informal activities, pension receipts, interest and payments from rentals, plus any other source of
income. All ﬁgures cited are measured in November 1998 (survey wave 3).

Xhv0 includes baseline characteristics of the head, household and village, and standard
errors are clustered by village (the level at with Progresa operates) to capture common
shocks across households. We consider changes in consumption and investment over
the same period, utilising surveys from March 1998, May 1999 and November 1999.
Our working sample of eligibles for consumption outcomes covers over 10,000
households in these survey waves.24

As take-up is near universal, estimating (3) among eligibles, bE

2 measures the average
treatment effect (ATE) for isolated households, bE
3 is the ATE for connected

households. These are identiﬁed solely by exploiting the randomisation across villages,
assuming no spillovers across villages. Hence for each type of household in treated
villages, the counterfactual is the same type of household in control villages. The
evidence in Table 1 shows the eligibility, consumption and investment characteristics
of connected and isolated households to be well balanced at baseline across treatment
and control villages.

These ATE estimates for isolated and connected households measure the causal
impact of resource shocks on consumption and investment. The difference between

Table 1 previously suggested there are few differences on observables between both
household types, this difference is less central to our analysis. We focus predominantly
on the main ATE estimates that exploit only the randomisation and identify how
households with a given family structure respond to resource inﬂows. Finally, we note

23 Although in the very long run, we expect family networks to adjust through marriage, mortality and
migration, our analysis treats networks as ﬁxed. A nascent empirical literature studies whether ﬁnancial
market innovations lead to changes in social network structures (Banerjee et al., 2014; Binzel et al., 2014).
24 Xhv0 includes the following controls (measured at baseline): age of the household head, household size
by age brackets (0–7, 8–14, 15–19, more than 19), the standardised household wealth index, village
marginalisation index and region dummies. To account for one imbalance at baseline, we additionally
control for the household’s primary school enrolment rate at baseline when we consider investment
outcomes. We do not utilise data from the third survey wave (November 1998) as in many treated villages, the
programme had only just started operating in some treated locations and was not fully operational in other
treated villages. Including this data wave thus leads to slightly less precision in some estimates and this cannot
be properly dealt with absent administrative records detailing the exact time at which transfers began to be
implemented in each treated village. For comparability, we use the same waves of data for our baseline
consumption and investment results. However, as Table A1 details, consumption speciﬁcations could also be
run using the ﬁrst wave of data (October 1997) and the results are qualitatively unchanged if we do so.

get to the heart of whether there is resource pooling within family networks, and are
based on a working sample of over 4,000 ineligible households across the same three
survey waves as for the ATE impacts described above.

Two further points are of note. First, these ITE estimates are identiﬁed exploiting
only the randomisation across villages. For ineligible isolated households that do not
pool resources with others in the village, consumption should be unaffected by the

resource inﬂows experienced by others (bI

as a whole. As such, the programme might have general equilibrium effects operating

this directly. Second, for the consumption outcomes of ineligibles, we can derive the
implied marginal propensity to consume out of the family network’s entire resource
inﬂow by dividing the ITE estimate by the actual transfer received per network
member, where both are measured in adult equivalents:

The ﬁnal stage of empirical analysis for consumption and investment outcomes
exploits the full richness of our data and estimates impacts of resource increases at the
level of the family network as a whole: hence the unit of analysis is network n in village v
in wave t. Recall that there are around three family networks per village and we focus
on those networks with at least one eligible household within them. We then estimate
an OLS difference-in-difference speciﬁcation analogous to (3) but aggregated to the
level of each network:

3.1. Direct Effects on Eligibles

We ﬁrst present our ﬁndings on consumption following the three-step sequencing
described above. Column (1) of Table 2 considers the sample of eligible households
= E) and presents ATE estimates from (3), measuring how eligibles are impacted by
(Dh
their own increase in resources. This shows that for food consumption expenditures:

(i) eligible isolated households have an increase of 12.9 pesos in their consump-
tion relative to counterfactual eligible and isolated households in control
villages: while this difference is not statistically signiﬁcant, it is not precisely
estimated either, so that we cannot rule our relatively large consumption
responses of eligible isolated households to Progresa;

(ii) connected households signiﬁcantly increase their consumption by 32.7 pesos

relative to connected households in control villages; and

(iii) the difference in these ATE estimates between connected and isolated
[ 0), despite both types of
households is signiﬁcant at the 1% level (
household having similar levels of food consumption at baseline and receiving
similar valued potential transfers (as shown in Table 1).

bb E

The foot of column (1) reports the implied MPC to consume out of own transfers is
0.691 for connected households and only 0.276 for isolated households. Among
connected households, the implied short-run MPC out of transfers is of comparable
magnitude to other studies (Bhalla, 1979; Musgrove, 1979; Paxson, 1992; Gertler et al.,
2012). The implied MPC suggests around 30% of received transfers are channelled to
alternative uses among connected households. We later examine the extent to which
resource pooling within families allows connected households to undertake non-
collateralisable investments. For isolated households, given the weaker consumption
response to transfers, it is vital to consider investment outcomes to obtain a more
complete picture of how such households choose to utilise the resource inﬂow Progresa
represents.25

3.2. Indirect Effects on Ineligibles

Column (2) in Table 2 considers the sample of ineligible households (Dh
presents ITE estimates from (3). This shows that for food consumption:

= I ) and

25 Bhalla (1979) reports an MPC of 0.61 for rural India; Musgrove (1979) reports MPC 2 [0.78–0.88) for
individuals residing in urban areas in various countries in Latin America. Exploiting rainfall shocks, Paxson
(1992) documents MPC 2 [0.56–0.84] for rice farmers in Thailand. Finally, Gertler et al. (2012) report an
MPC of 0.74 in the Progresa evaluation data when all eligibles are considered together: our results highlight
the considerable heterogeneity in MPCs by household type that underlie this, and that this difference is best
understood by considering both consumption and investment outcomes. Albarran and Attanasio (2003)
present evidence that private resource transfers are crowded-out by the receipt of Progresa transfers and so our
implied MPC is likely an underestimate.

villages. The number of households refers to the number observed in the ﬁrst wave of data used, wave 2
(March 1998). The dependent variable is the adult equivalent monthly food expenditures (in pesos). The
sample covers consumption data from waves 2 (March 1998), 4 (May 1999) and 5 (November 1999). OLS
regression estimates are presented, where standard errors are clustered by village. Connected households are
those that have at least one family member living and heading their own separate household in the same
village. In all speciﬁcations we include the following controls (as measured at baseline): age of the household
head, household size by age brackets (0–7, 8–14, 15–19, more than 19), the standardised household wealth
index, village marginalisation index and region dummies. As the sample includes only eligible households
and take-up is close to 100%, the reported coefﬁcients correspond to average treatment effects (ATE). In the
lower half of the Table, we report the implied marginal propensities to consume (MPC) out of actual Progresa
transfers received by the household itself. Like the consumption measures, these actual transfers are also
measured in adult equivalent monthly pesos. The adult equivalence scale used for potential transfers and
consumption is one for members 18 or older, and 0.73 otherwise. For food consumption expenditures, we
use wave 2 (March 1998) prices. In March 1998, US$1  = 10 pesos. We use the monthly Bank of Mexico CPI

because such locations are least integrated with markets.

striking similarity between how on the margin, eligible and ineligible households
convert additional resources into consumption: the MPC derived from the ATE is
0.691; the MPC derived from the ITE is similar at 0.639. In short, this implies that for
every dollar that accrues to the family network as a whole, this leads to a 65¢ increase
in food consumption and this effect is similar for eligible and ineligible households
in the network. This is clean evidence in favour of resource pooling within the
extended family network, that has not previously been documented in the context of
Progresa.

Figure 2(b) graphs how the distribution of food consumption expenditures are
shifted for both eligibles and ineligibles, and that a substantial share of both sets of
households are brought above the global poverty line by the interplay of
the
programme and resource pooling by extended families.

3.3. Network Effects

We now focus on the family network as the relevant unit and estimate (5) for networks
with at least one eligible household in them. The parameter of interest, dN
is
1 ,
identiﬁed, exploiting the experimental research design. Table 3 presents the results.
Column (1) shows that average food consumption in family networks in treatment
villages is 15.6 pesos higher than in such networks in control villages, a signiﬁcant
difference at the 5% level. Column (2) shows the effect of resource increases on
network consumption inequality, as measured by the standard deviation in cross-
sectional log consumption in the network, ynvt ¼ sdðlog yhvtÞ
h2hðnÞ. This shows family
networks in treated villages have the same levels of inequality as counterfactual
networks in control villages. Given the assumed underlying objective of family networks
is to maximise the sum of utilities across their members, the result suggests this does
not entail changes in consumption inequality within the network. This result has two
important implications: ﬁrst, it shows that in the short run, family networks partially
undo transfer programmes aimed at assisting the poor. Indeed, if all households were
in a family network, transfer-based poverty programmes would have little impact on
short-run inequality. Second, the result suggests the Pareto weight of connected
households is unchanged over the study period.

Finally, we explore how the architecture of family networks impacts consumption
responses. To do so, we estimate (5) allowing for an interaction between the Progresa
dummy (Pvt) and network characteristics (Nn). We ﬁrst consider network size, as it has
been argued that in some cases, larger networks can better smooth consumption
(Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2016). We split family networks into those above/below the
median size and summarise our ﬁndings in the ﬁrst panel of Figure 3(a). This shows
the earlier effects are largely driven by larger family networks (despite the average
transfer per adult equivalent being the same in small and large networks): in treated
villages, the response in mean food expenditures is 26.9 pesos, that is signiﬁcantly
greater than the response among smaller than median sized networks in the same
village.

The remaining panels of Figure 3(a) explore how other dimensions of network
architecture interplay with consumption responses of family networks that experience
resource inﬂows and show:

network. The sample covers consumption data from waves 2 (March 1998), 4 (May 1999) and 5 (November

speciﬁcations we include the following controls averaged at the network level (as measured at baseline):
age of the household head, household size by age brackets (0–7, 8–14, 15–19, more than 19), the
standardised household wealth index, village marginalisation index and region dummies. In the lower half
of the Table, we report the implied marginal propensities to consume (MPC) out of actual Progresa
transfers per household in the extended family network. Like the consumption measures, actual transfers
are also measured in adult equivalent monthly pesos. The adult equivalence scale used for potential
transfers and consumption is one for members 18 or older, and 0.73 otherwise. In March 1998, US$1 = 10
pesos. For food we use wave 2 (March 1998) prices. We use the monthly Bank of Mexico CPI series to
deﬂate monetary values for non-food items.

(i) networks

that are above median diameter (and so likely span more

generations) have signiﬁcant consumption responses; and

(ii) more highly linked networks (as measured by their closeness centrality)
have signiﬁcant consumption responses. In short, for a given transfer,
larger and more linked networks appear able to achieve higher levels of
consumption.

This opens up interesting avenues for future research, as in Ambrus et al. (2014) and
Chandrasekhar et al. (2014), for better understanding the link between network
architectures and household consumption.

To characterise household responses to resource inﬂows fully, we now analyse
investment outcomes. We ﬁrst present ATE estimates from (3) using eligibles,
considering three types of investment: those into small livestock (e.g. poultry) that can
be thought of as highly collateralisable, those into childrens’ human capital in the
form of secondary schooling, that are considered to be of low collateralisability, with
investment into larger livestock (e.g. cattle) somewhere between these extremes. As
Table 1 showed, given that rates of livestock ownership are over 80%, there is not much
scope for the extensive margin for such investments to change. Hence, we consider the
impacts of resource increases on the peso value of owned livestock. We do so for over

Notes. The Figures show heterogeneous NATE estimates across networks with above/below the
median of a given characteristic: Figure 3(a) shows these effects for food consumption
expenditures, and Figure 3(b) shows them for secondary school enrolment rates. The three
network characteristics considered are: (i) the network size (namely, the total number of
households in the family network); (ii) the diameter of the network (namely, the maximum
distance from one household to another in the network); (iii) the closeness of the network as
measured by group closeness centrality index. For each characteristics we show the NATE
impacts above and below the median of each statistic (as calculated over all family networks with
at least one eligible household in them), as well as the difference between the two NATE
estimates. On each bar, *** denotes signiﬁcance at 1%, ** at 5%, and * at 10%. Colour ﬁgure can

Column (1) of Table 4 shows that for small livestock:

(i) neither eligible isolated nor connected households have any signiﬁcant
change in the value of owned livestock relative to counterfactual households
in control villages; and

(ii) the difference in these ATE estimates between connected and isolated

households is not signiﬁcant (

Hence as expected, resource inﬂows to households have no impact on such
collateralisable investments because credit market imperfections are not so severe
that such forms of investment cannot be ﬁnanced.

households refers to the number observed in the ﬁrst wave of data used, wave 2 (March 1998). In column (1),
‘small’ livestock includes chickens, rabbits, pigs and goats. In column (2), ‘large’ livestock includes donkeys,
horses, cows and oxen. This division of livestock is based on physical size. Prices for livestock are taken from
wave 2 (March 1998) at the village level, replacing missing values with municipality averages. The dependent
variable in column (3) is the share of children aged 11–16 that are resident and enrolled in secondary
schooling. The dependent variable in column (4) is the share of children aged 11 to 16 that households
report as having worked in the week prior to the survey. The sample covers investment/child labour data
from waves 2 (March 1998), 4 (May 1999) and 5 (November 1999). OLS regression estimates are presented,
where standard errors are clustered by village. Connected households are those that have at least one family
member living and heading their own separate household in the same village. In all speciﬁcations we include
the following controls (as measured at baseline): age of the household head, bins for household size by age
brackets (0–7, 8–14, 15–19, more than 19), the standardised household wealth index, the village
marginalisation index and region dummies. In columns (3) and (4), we also control for the household’s
primary school enrolment rate at baseline. As the sample includes only eligible households and take-up is
close to 100%, the reported coefﬁcients correspond to average treatment effects (ATE).

corresponds to around 4.6 months worth of transfers the median isolated household
would have received up until then. By considering investment outcomes, we are able to
explain the otherwise puzzling weak consumption response of eligible isolated
households to resource inﬂows documented in Table 2. More precisely,
these
investment responses to Progresa by isolated households are consistent with the lack
of a statistically signiﬁcant consumption responses documented in Table 2: isolated
eligible households use their transfers to buy large livestock, since, presumably, it is
difﬁcult for them to ﬁnance such investments through loans (recall that less than 3%
of all households report having outstanding loans at baseline).

Moreover, such investments likely generate earnings streams from the sales of
livestock produce that are less correlated with other income streams.27 Of course, if
negative resource changes have symmetric effects on isolated households, then these
ﬁndings link to Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993), who ﬁrst identiﬁed that larger draft
animals are sold off by households in economic distress, and validates the theoretical
concern raised by Chetty and Looney (2006) that the ability of households to smooth
consumption does not imply there are zero welfare costs of income risk.28,29

Column (3) repeats the analysis for investment into secondary schooling. We ﬁnd a
starkly different pattern of responses from those into livestock, that indeed more
closely resembles the ATE impacts for food consumption:

(i) isolated households that experience a resource inﬂow have no signiﬁcant
change in their secondary school enrolments relative to isolated households in
control villages;

(ii) connected households signiﬁcantly increase their schooling investment by
7.5pp relative to counterfactual connected households in control villages
(corresponding to a 12% increase over the baseline level); and

(iii) the difference in these impacts is signiﬁcant at the 1% level despite both
isolated and connected households receiving resource inﬂows of similar
amounts and having the same levels of secondary school enrolment at baseline
(Table 1).

Given the value of Progresa transfers is insufﬁcient to cover the full opportunity cost of
secondary schooling, such non-collateralisable investments can only be undertaken by

27 In support of this, we note that 50% of heads of isolated households report being a daily wage labourer
as their main occupation pre-programme. Such workers face the highest income earnings volatility relative to
other occupations in agrarian economies, with earnings generated from livestock produce considered to be
among the least volatile (Townsend, 1994; Bandiera et al., 2017). Hence there would be a desire among these
households to diversify income streams towards those arising from livestock.

28 The important issue raised by Chetty and Looney (2006) is that if households are highly risk averse then
consumption smoothing might be achieved through behaviours that reduce household’s long run welfare,
such as taking children out of school or selling productive assets. Hence, focusing exclusively on how
consumption responds to idiosyncratic income shocks is insufﬁcient to fully characterise the welfare costs of
income risk. Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993) long provided evidence of precisely this type of interlinkage for
rural Indian households: they show when farm proﬁt realisations are low, such households are forced to sell
off bullocks to smooth consumption.

29 To check for suggestive evidence that isolated households indeed have higher consumption variability
that connected households and so might be more vulnerable to shocks, we regress the longitudinal standard
deviation of log (consumption) of a household, constructed over all waves of data, on a dummy for whether
the households is connected and isolated households. Doing so we ﬁnd the coefﬁcient on being connected is
 0.013 with a standard error of 0.004.

connected households rather than isolated households because they are engaged in
resource pooling arrangements with extended family members. This build on the
evidence presented in Angelucci et al. (2010) that ﬁrst highlighted a potential for
resource transfers within family networks to ﬁnance schooling investments. These
ﬁndings also neatly complement
those of Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993) and
Fafchamps and Pender (1997) that both document in the context of India, how rural
households are observed investing into cattle but not in higher return but non-
collateralisable and lumpy investments in irrigation.

To probe further whether the impacts on human capital

investments reﬂect
relaxed credit constraints, column (4) considers household responses in terms of
child labour: the share of children aged 11–16 that households report as having
worked in the week prior to the survey. This result matches with the earlier ﬁnding
for schooling:

(i) there is no reduction in child labour among eligible isolated households in

response to resource inﬂows; and

(ii) eligible connected households signiﬁcantly reduce the incidence of child

labour by 3.6pp relative to counterfactual households in control villages.

Taking the schooling and child labour results together suggests when connected
households have more resources, they prefer to reallocate their children away from
work (and thus choose to give up some income) and towards investing in their
childrens’ human capital.30

estimates measure the indirect effect of Progresa on ineligibles’ investment and are
again identiﬁed exploiting only the random assignment of villages to treatment and
control. Columns (1) and (2) show that for collateralisable investments into livestock:

(i) neither ineligible isolated nor ineligible connected households have any
signiﬁcant change in the value of owned livestock relative to counterfactual
households in control villages; and

(ii) this is the case for both small and large animal types of livestock.

This lack of spillover effect to ineligibles suggest the large injection of resources that
Progresa provides at the village level does not alter the marginal net beneﬁt of making
such livestock investments and so these are independent of household, network or
aggregate resources.

Repeating the analysis among ineligibles for schooling investment in columns (3)

and (4):

30 Of course, investments into livestock and human capital differ on other dimensions beyond those
related to credit constraints. For example, if schooling is considered a more risky investment and isolated
households are more risk averse than connected households, this might also be consistent with the
documented pattern of responses. However, it would be inconsistent with the evidence in Table 1 that at
baseline, isolated and connected households have similar levels of investment across all three types of activity.

the standardised household wealth index,

(i) we continue to ﬁnd no evidence of general equilibrium effects through the

null response of isolated households;

(ii) we also ﬁnd muted investment responses among connected ineligibles.

Hence, if family networks share resources, they do so in a way that allows poorer
network members, and hence eligible for Progresa, to increase non-collateralisable
investments into human capital. Resource transfers that ﬂow from eligibles to
ineligibles within the network are largely spent on food consumption, as shown in
Table 2. It is rational for schooling investments of poorer networks members to
increase, rather than among less poor (ineligible) members: if the former do so, they
increase the value of conditional cash transfers received, while this is not the case if
ineligibles increase their schooling investment.31

31 Positive spillover effects on school enrolment of ineligibles have been documented in some other
studies (Bobonis and Finan, 2009; Lalive and Cattaneo, 2009), although others have found no such spillovers
(Schultz, 2004; Behrman et al., 2005). These differences might stem from alternative methodologies: Bobonis
and Finan (2009) and Lalive and Cattaneo (2009) match children over waves and consider changes in
individual enrolment status. Lalive and Cattaneo (2009) document programme effects between October
1997 and November 1998, and consider enrolment for both primary school aged children and those
transiting to secondary school. Bobonis and Finan (2009) document the spillovers to be larger among the
poorest ineligibles. Our results indicate that on average, extended families do not strongly inﬂuence such
spillovers in secondary enrolment.

Finally, column (4) investigates the incidence of child labour among ineligibles: we
ﬁnd no signiﬁcant difference in child labour between treatment and control villages of
either isolated or connected households. This ﬁnding suggests the programme does

Considering together the ATE and ITE estimates on schooling are informative of
changes in inequality in human capital
investments within family networks in
response to resource inﬂows. At baseline, eligible and ineligible connected
households have similar levels of secondary school enrolment, 64%. Hence the
resource increase that eligibles experience allows them to overtake the investments
made into human capital by less poor ineligibles in their family network. This is in
contrast to the earlier result for consumption inequality within family networks, that
was unchanged in response to signiﬁcant resource injections into networks due to
Progresa.

4.3. Network Effects

To complete the investment analysis, we estimate (5) focusing on the family network as
the relevant unit. Table 6 presents the results for networks with at least one eligible
household in them. On collateralisable investments, column (1) reafﬁrms there is no
signiﬁcant increase in the value of small animal investments as a result of the network
experiencing a positive injection of resources. Column (2) shows a similar pattern of
null responses at the network level on the value of larger forms of livestock (recall the
earlier positive ATE results on large animals in Table 4 were driven by isolated
households who are not included in these NATE estimates).

Column (3) focuses on schooling investments and here we see relative to
counterfactual networks in control villages: for the average network member, secondary
school enrolment rates increase by 6.0pp. In short, resource pooling arrangements
among family networks can overcome credit constraints into non-collateralisable
investments only if the network as a whole experiences a sufﬁciently large resource
increase. Column (4) considers the impact of resource inﬂows to child labour in family
networks as a whole and shows the reduction in the incidence of child labor of 6.1pp is
close to equal and opposite the magnitude of the increase in schooling (6.0pp).

Finally, Figure 3(b) exploits information on network architectures to see how the
investment responses vary with the architecture of the family network. We see an
intriguing pattern of responses to be considered in conjunction with the network
responses for consumption shown in Figure 3(a):

(i) there are signiﬁcant impacts on school enrolment for networks above and
below the three statistics considered: the size of the network, its diameter, and
its group closeness centrality; and

(ii) however in each case, within treatment villages,

the response of

those

networks above the median is smaller than those below the median.

network in survey wave t, and the sample covers all networks with at least one eligible household in 503
villages. The number of extended family networks refers to the number observed in the ﬁrst wave of data
used, wave 2 (March 1998). In column (1), ‘small’ livestock includes chickens, rabbits, pigs and goats. In
column (2), ‘large’ livestock includes donkeys, horses, cows and oxen. This division of livestock is based on
physical size. The dependent variable in column (3) is the share of children aged 11–16 that are resident and
enrolled in secondary schooling. The dependent variable in column 4 is the share of children aged 11–16
that households report as having worked in the week prior to the survey. All outcomes are averaged at the
family network level. The sample covers investment/child labour data from waves 2 (March 1998), 4 (May
1999) and 5 (November 1999). OLS regression estimates are presented, where standard errors are clustered
by village. Connected households are those that have at least one family member living and heading their
own separate household in the same village. In all speciﬁcations, we include the following controls averaged
at the network level (as measured at baseline): age of the household head, household size by age brackets (0–
7, 8–14, 15–19, more than 19), the standardised household wealth index, village marginalisation index, and
region dummies. In columns (3) and (4), we also control for the household’s primary school enrolment rate
at baseline.

Viewed alongside Figure 3(a), this illustrates the interlinkage between consump-
tion and investment choices for family networks subject to resource inﬂows.
Larger and more dense networks that appear to have the greatest consumption
response among their members are also those with marginally smaller investment
responses.

5. Consumption and Investment in the Longer Term

We have documented how resource pooling in family networks allows for the relaxation
of credit constraints for non-collateralisable investments such as those into the human
capital. As the returns to such investments are realised, this has long-term impacts on
consumption for connected households relative to isolated households. To assess these
longer term gains, we exploit the ﬁnal wave of household panel data collected in
November 2003, ﬁve years after the ﬁrst Progresa transfers were made in treated villages.
From late 1999 onwards, the experimental evaluation ended and the programme was
rolled out over all control villages. Hence when using this longer window of analysis into
the post-evaluation period, it is useful to deﬁne a dummy Π
= 1 if village v was originally
randomly assigned to receive Progresa in 1998, and Π
= 0 otherwise. We then estimate the

where Dyhv is the change in consumption/investment outcome from March 1998 and
November 2003, Nh is a dummy for whether household h is connected or not, and Xhv0
includes the same set of characteristics as before. We continue to cluster standard
errors by village. The coefﬁcient of interest, j3, measures the difference-in-difference
in outcomes between connected and isolated households (irrespective of their original
eligibility status), from having been treated for the full ﬁve years relative to the short
run effects documented earlier. Table 7 presents the results from tracking 14,000
households over this ﬁve year period.

On consumption, column (1) shows that households embedded within family
networks have monthly food expenditures that are 19.8 pesos higher than for isolated
households: recall that at baseline, there were no signiﬁcant differences in food
expenditures between connected and isolated households. This impact corresponds to
a 14% increase in adult equivalent food expenditures over baseline levels. It is plausible
that this reﬂects the returns to human capital investments being realised within the
ﬁve-year window given secondary schooling lasts three years in this setting, and the
perceived and actual returns to secondary schooling are substantial (Attanasio and
Kaufmann, 2014). As Progresa transfers have the largest marginal impact in shifting
children into secondary schooling then there could well be large productivity impacts
because of the programme, that feed into this magnitude of higher household
resources in the longer term.

The remaining columns examine if investment outcomes differ in the longer term
between connected and isolated households. Columns (2)–(6) show no differential
impact on livestock investments between isolated and connected households, for
neither small nor large animals. This suggests:

(i) the credit market for small livestock is well functioning; and
(ii) any gains to isolated households in being able to invest more into larger
animals seem to be short lived: perhaps because such assets are liquidated
when they later face a negative resource shock, as documented for rural
Indian households by Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993).

Column (6) examines non-collateralisable schooling investments: we see a signiﬁ-
cant differential
impact between connected and isolated households: as Table 1
showed, at baseline these households had secondary school enrolment rates of 65%
and 66% respectively. These longer term results show that this gap grows by 6.4pp,
corresponding to just under 10% of the baseline levels, ﬁve years after households
and their network members begin experiencing exogenously timed resource inﬂows.
Two points are of note. First, the result suggests that connected households do not
reverse decisions to invest in their childrens’ human capital over this ﬁve year time
frame. Second, within-village inequality in investments in the human capital of
secondary school-aged children increases because of resource pooling within family
networks.

We note that these longer term differentials also vary with the intensity with which
households experience positive resource shocks from Progresa. Consider the simple
division of households between those above and below the median number of children
aged 0–14 in the household at baseline: those households eligible with more children
should receive greater valued transfers all else equal. In line with this we ﬁnd the

differential impact on food expenditures and secondary school investment of resource
shocks between connected and isolated households with above the median number of
children at baseline to be larger: the longer term impact on food consumption is 34
pesos (corresponding to a 24% increase over baseline levels) and the impact on
schooling is 9.9pp (around 15% of the baseline level). As in Gertler et al. (2012), we
ﬁnd that connected households do not converge back to pre-programme poverty levels
over this horizon. This suggests the interplay between resource inﬂows and resource
pooling to foster investment within family networks might enable them to escape the
kinds of poverty trap that have long concerned development economists (Lewis, 1954).
This is counter to the predictions of the literature highlighting kinship taxes as a key
motive for within family resource transfers: such taxes lead to productive and allocative
distortions, and thus can be a root cause of poverty traps.

6. Conclusion

This article studies a novel motive for resource pooling in family networks in village
economies: to relax credit constraints and facilitate investment, especially those in non-
collateraliseable assets for which credit market imperfections are most binding. While
there is an established literature examining risk-sharing motives for resource transfers
within family networks, as well as motives based on obligations related to kinship taxes,
our innovation is to examine the consequences of resource sharing on investment
outcomes. We do so by exploiting the Progresa experimental evaluation data, in which
extended family networks can be identiﬁed, households are subject to exogenous and
large resource inﬂows, and detailed responses on consumption and an array of
investments can be tracked in a panel of households over the long term. Our key
ﬁndings show consumption and investment responses of households to resource
inﬂows depend fundamentally on whether or not they are embedded in extended
family networks. This has implications for consumption outcomes across all network
members, the nature of assets invested into, and the longer term trajectory out of
poverty for the network as a whole.

Our contribution is empirical. However, our ﬁndings highlight that there remains
enormous scope for developing models of decision making within networks, that
would properly micro-found the conceptual framework discussed. Key modelling
aspects might be to:

(i) jointly study consumption and investment decision;
(ii) embed multiple motives for resource pooling into models (rather than
studying risk insurance, kinship tax, and investment motives separately); and

(iii) consider how network architecture determines outcomes.

The role of policy when households engage in informal resource sharing
arrangements has been much discussed. As Attanasio and Rios-Rull (2003) make
precise in the context of risk-sharing motives for resource sharing, policies that
partially counteract ﬁnancial market imperfections can reduce welfare because if
households only enter self-enforcing contracts, the amount of risk sharing that can be
sustained in equilibrium depends on the harshness of the punishment and, therefore,
the value of autarky. If policies increase the value of autarky relative to the value of

being in the informal contract, risk sharing decreases, weakening the social fabric of
village economies.

In our empirical context, if households view the increase in resources Progresa
provides as being permanent, they have less reason to sustain resource pooling
agreements with their extended family, all else equal, instead opting for autarky or to
reformulate such arrangements among a smaller coalition of network members
(Genicot and Ray, 2003). This does not happen: resource pooling is sustained among
family networks when their poorest members experience resource inﬂows and these
gains in consumption and investment within the network persist over the long term
(and even allow the poorest members of networks to overtake the richer members in
terms of investments into their childrens’ human capital). This suggests that within
family networks, the degree of altruism for others is high, or mechanisms to punish or
ostracise households that renege on their obligations are effective (Ambrus et al.,
2014).

We close by highlighting two broader implications of our study. The ﬁrst is the link
between our results and the public ﬁnance literature on targeting: eligible and
connected households share the transfers Progresa provides with less poor ineligibles.
This leakage is substantial, with the marginal propensity to consume out of Progresa
transfers being almost equal between eligible and ineligible households in the same
family network. Combined with our results on consumption inequality in networks, we
show that family networks partially undo transfer programmes aimed at assisting the
if all households were in a family network, transfer-based poverty
poor. Indeed,
programmes would have little impact on inequality,
if Pareto weights remained
unchanged. This leakage towards ineligibles might be viewed negatively if it partially
undoes the redistributive objectives of the policy maker, or could be viewed positively if
households exploit private information to reach resource allocations maximising social
welfare. Understanding which of these scenarios is more accurate needs to be
addressed in future work.32

Second, our longer term ﬁndings emphasise a virtuous cycle can be kick-started
when a family network as a whole receives a sufﬁciently large injection of resources: we
document how this allows poorer members of
in non-
collateralisable assets, that then has feedback effects on longer term consumption as
the returns to such investments are realised. This bridges to long-standing ‘big push’
theories of development, and an emerging set of evaluations highlighting that large-
scale asset transfer programmes can place households on trajectories out of poverty in
the long term (Bandiera et al., 2017; Banerjee et al., 2016). This all underlines the
importance for future impact evaluations to trace and use of resource injections (be
they in the form of assets, conditional cash transfers, or in some other metric), among
family networks in village economies.

the network to invest

32 Alatas et al. (2016) show that using private information of social networks in village economies leads to a
different set of households being identiﬁed by communities as being the most needy, compared to other
common targeting methods.
